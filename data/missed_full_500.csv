Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

Each lens is dominated by a wide rubberized manual zoom ring. There are marked detent positions for specific focal lengths, but there is no manual focus – that’s done in-camera. Nikon created a new Stepping Drive Motor for the CX mount, and it’s quite silent – very comparable to the full-ring motor Silent Wave on the F-mount. While the lenses have Vibration Reduction, there are no external controls – it’s all controlled in the camera by accessing a specific menu. Interestingly, there are no options to turn off VR, it’s on by default. Finally, each lens has a large button on the zoom ring – the zooms must be released from their most compact carry position in order to work correctly.<query> what is the zoom ring on a nikon camera</query> By doing so, the camera also automatically powers up. The reverse is not true – collapsing the lenses back to carry position is simply that. You’ll have to power down manually using the ON/OFF switch. Despite not having a dedicated EVF, the J1’s rear display was more than adequate to the task when composing, viewing and manipulating the camera. The display did not wash out easily, exhibited sharp and vibrant images, and had a very generous viewing angle. However the display is a drain on your battery life. With a CIPA rating of about 230 shots, the enthusiast user is going to need, not want, a second battery for maximum shoot time in the field. The lenses zoom rather smoothly, and there are no hitches or rough spots encountered. The hood on the telezoom is effective, and serves as secondary protection.<query> how many shots does a tele zoom camera take</query> Both lenses were easy to mount and dis-mount; the small size and weight complemented theNikon J1 quite nicely; it was difficult to tell at times which lens was on from a visual inspection – they’re that small and unobtrusive. The camera’s dearth of external controls has been the subject of much discussion since the 1 Series debuted. In particular, the lack of a true Function button, which could be reassigned to an often manipulated control such as ISO or White Balance, as well as an equivalent “Recent Settings” menu, would go a long way to addressing some of the concerns. In addition, the inability to disable Auto-Review of the last taken image does hamper the “flow” of shooting photos in the field. It remains to be seen if Nikon will address those changes in a future firmware revision.<query> what is the function button on a nikon camera</query> Performance In a single word – excellent. With some caveats covered below. Let’s talk about the focus capability first. There is no menu or external control to invoke Phase-Detect versus Contrast-Detect. The camera evaluates the ambient light values in the frame and decides accordingly. That “threshold” is difficult to quantify in a field-review, but you can easily tell when you’re in PD – especially if you chose Auto-Area AF – the rectangles light up and subjects immediately jump into focus – no hesitation. In fact, it felt very much like the Nikon D3100’s AutoArea AF performance. That’s not to say you’ll be replacing your D3 with this camera anytime soon – but the claim of DSLR-like focus performance is true. As light levels drop, the camera will switch to more traditional CD, which has the familiar one-step “stutter” at the end of the focusing operation to confirm the subject lock.<query> what is the focus of a nikon d3100</query> Nikon’s implementation of PD directly on-sensor is a promising innovation, and hopefully will be seen in future offerings from other makers as well. The PD is nicely complemented by a 73-point AF system – providing effective and wide coverage of the viewfinder area. You’ll be hard pressed to find a section not covered by an AF point. The CD gives you even more, with a 135-point coverage pattern. The subject really needs to have contrast under the AF point to optimize the lock-on, but overall the experience is like no other – I had the opportunity to let several other enthusiast and commercial shooters try out the camera briefly during a day-long road trip – they were all quite impressed and noted how the AF system made the camera feel very responsive for casual shooting.<query> what is af point on nikon cd</query> On the image quality side, theNikon J1 does not disappoint. Shots of the Provincetown harbor and other Cape Cod landmarks, in both rain and blue sky all reflect the color, contrast and sharpness typical of Nikon products and image processing. The Providence skyline exhibited good detail and excellent metering response, with no blowouts and good shadow detail. Colorful boats in P-Town harbor following a brief rainstorm. Nauset Light shrouded in a fast-moving storm front. Elevated perspective of the East Side, Providence R.I. Telephoto shot at 110mm max zoom (300mm equiv.) As a compact camera, theNikon J1 shines in terms of portability and convenience. With two zooms covering the most common focal lengths of 27-300mm and exhibiting a very low-profile, it was easy to pull the camera in and out of a jacket pocket for grab shots or to quickly swap lenses.<query> what is the zoom of nikon j1</query> From the forest pines of Rayce Point to the narrow alleys and beachfronts of Provincetown, it was easy to carry and yet the camera delivered some amazing wide-angles, zoom shots and close-ups. (Some samples thanks to Thomas P. Sisto) On the trail with fellow shutterbugs! Fungus close-ups from the forest floor. Monuments in the mist… Some “found” artwork patterns in a back alley… The beach at low tide… One of the advantages of ILCs is the lack of a mirror box assembly. The slap of the mirror system degrades the stability of certain exposures close to the hand-held shutter speed “danger zone.” Without that mirror challenge, your ability to hand-hold inside the zone goes up accordingly. While some of these shots lack any artistic or inspirational value, the first two frames below were at 1/4th and 1/5th respectively.<query> what is the advantage of ilc camera</query> Without VR, these types of photos would be impossible to obtain. Again, it was easy to keep theNikon J1 close at hand and keep an eye out for near-dusk and after-dark compositions. Low light Example 1 Low light Example 2 The “Superman Building” near Kennedy Plaza The Providence Statehouse at dusk Indoors, the camera’s limiting factor is based upon the CX lenses available now. The 10mm f2.8 pancake prime is a good start, but really isn’t that fast when talking about ambient light photography. In addition, the relatively low 1/60th flash synch ceiling imposes further challenges to action-freezing. The optional FT-1 adapter opens up options by allowing access to a bigger range of F-mount lenses, but the 2.7x crop factor effectively turns even a normal 50mm f1.8 into a mid-tele 135mm.<query> what is the limiting factor of a nikon j1</query> That’s great for portrait and stand-off shooters, not so good for those who prefer to get in close and wide. Despite those factors, the J1 didn’t do too badly in a typically fluorescent-lit karate studio or a restaurant interior with the slow zooms. The noise is noticeable but not objectionable, and with some NR post-process, the images can be cleaned up for reasonable size reproductions, web use or conversion to B&W. Karate studio work using the 30-110 Waiting for my breakfast! Caveats So what are the downsides? As a first-generation product, theNikon 1 Series does deliver on innovations such as PD on-sensor, as well as living up to the image quality one expects from the brand. However, it’s not that simple a proposition. Based on the design and features, the target audience is clearly the average compact P&S owner wanting to move up-tier, gaining more capability and access to interchangeable lenses.<query> what is the downside of the nikon j1</query> In that regard, the camera is a clear success. The tougher proposition is for the enthusiast - such as readers of SeriousCompacts.com. That market segment is not going to be fully satisfied by the current iteration of the 1 Series. TheNikon V1 would appeal more to the enthusiast crowd because of the integral EVF, but both models are constrained by a dearth of manual controls and limited lens system choices. That being said, this author and other photographers who had the opportunity to use the camera over the course of the evaluation all agree that if your type of photography lets you select a particular shooting mode and metering choice; the camera doesn’t get in the way. In fact, it was a liberating experience to just pay attention to the more artistic aspects of taking photos – the timing, the framing, the composition, etc.<query> what is the nikon v1 camera</query> LinkBack URL About LinkBacks Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page… Subscribe to this Thread… Search Thread Advanced Search Display Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode 03-05-2012, 06:34 PM #1 Covey22 New Member Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 2 Nikon J1 Review: A Field Report By Armando J. Heredia The Nikon 1 Series represents the long-awaited entry of a popular DSLR manufacturer into the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (ILC) market. TheNikon J1 model is the more consumer oriented version, and shares many common components and operating features with its enthusiast sibling, theNikon V1. The 1 Series stands out from the rapidly growing crowd of ILCs by a new sensor and hybrid AF system. Instead of iterating an APS-C body, Nikon chose to create a new sensor size and corresponding lens mount, an unexpected move to be sure.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> – the J1 took care of everything else. The PD AF system facilitated making the camera feel very responsive from shot-to-shot. But if you are a “fiddler” or enjoy complete and convenient access to all your camera’s controls, well, it’s going to be a tough sell. The relative lack of choices in lenses is simply a matter of time. Nikon will continue to iterate new CX mount optics, but the historic track record of times between releases doesn’t point to a quick rollout. Despite Nikon’s fine reputation for TTL flash, the onboard unit of the J1 doesn’t tie back into the larger CLS wireless system used by the DSLR product family. It’s a simple flash, period. Finally, there’s the price. At the USD599 starting point, theNikon J1 starts to bump up against the established lines at Olympus, Panasonic and Sony.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> The other manufacturers, by virtue of a head-start, enjoy advantages in price tiering, completeness of systems (i.e., lenses and accessory choices) and market penetration. At USD499, this could be a better seller. Conclusion As part of Nikon’s opening shot to the ILC market, theNikon J1 delivers on capability and performance. The Hybrid AF system really works, and the camera itself continues to live up to the manufacturer’s well-earned reputation as a leading provider of imaging technology. For compact users who are interested in moving up to a faster, higher performing camera and the potential of a larger imaging system (lenses and accessories); the J1 will satisfy. For enthusiast users, well, the only thing this author can recommend is to get down to a retail store and handle it for yourself.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> You may or may not find the dearth of controls to be inhibiting. From a cost perspective, this is where the rubber hits the road. The J1 is a first-generation model, and as such, early technology adopters have always paid a price – whether it was limited functionality, higher acquisition cost or both – to be first in line. With that philosophy, TheNikon 1 Series is priced accordingly – certainly not sky-high outrageous, but definitely not aiming to take market share based on competitive pricing. As such, buyers in general need to take a good hard look at the state of the market. The upside is that you’ll own one of the fastest and certainly one of the most innovative cameras today. The challenges will be to wait out the inevitable delay as more lenses and accessories become available, and seeing if changes in handling will occur through a firmware update.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> Overall, it’s a mixed recommendation – the Nikon J1 is great camera, but you’ll be paying a premium to have one.

She had a shocking pink 'J1' around her neck which, for some strange reason, she assumed I might like but I quickly put her straight on that!<query> what camera is used for slr</query> I spent a few minutes discussing cameras with her and pointed out that the 'V1' is a superbly designed camera which handles nicely, is unobtrusive, and 'designed' rather than styled like most of the others,...however, it is shot in it's foot by tiny sensor and MASSIVE over price being a staggering £700 here in the UK.... If I have my rate of exchange right thats about TWICE the US price!! I pointed out to her that, were nikon to make a similar camera with APS-C sensor and sensible (read; competitive) price then thye would have a showstopper on their hands. I, for one, would/will immediately change from my Sony NEX,... but as things stand why pay more for an inferior system in the same size package? I should add that the 'V1' is better designed and nicer in the hand than Sony NEX models but my minumum requirement is the APS-C sensor with 20x16 inch prints without any 'texture'...which my NEX 3 is well able to do.<query> what is the difference between nikon v1 and nex</query> ........

The design choice to produce only a 10MP resolving sensor is daring. Only four native lenses currently exist for the camera – a 10mm f2.8 pancake prime (equivalent 27mm), and two consumer-grade zooms, a 10-30mm f3.5-5.6 (equivalent 27-81mm), a 30-110mm f3.8-5.6 ED (equivalent 81-297mm) telephoto and a 10-110 mm f4.5-5.6 ED (equivalent 27-297mm) superzoom with a new silent Power Drive. The latter three lenses are equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR). The feature that received the most hype at pre-launch is the hybrid AF system – Nikon was able to integrate faster-focusing Phase Detect (PD) sensors directly upon the CX imaging chip.<query> what is the nikon cx sensor</query> ( 1 2) Going cold on the E-M5 - looking at a G3.

In lower light, the 1 Series would fall back to more traditional Contrast Detect (CD) sensors which are slower but more reliable in determining subject distance. The Nikon J1 also has some consumer-oriented and value-add features such as Motion Snapshot, which combines brief video and a still of the “decisive moment;” 1080P movie capture and slow-motion video (thanks to a high frame rate continuous mode). This review evaluated the camera’s still-photography features and has scoped out video functions accordingly. Initial Impressions The size of theNikon J1 is deceiving – at first glance, it’s no bigger than most of the lower-tier Coolpix P&S models that it displaces in the Nikon product family.<query> what is the nikon j1 camera</query> The J1 body is no larger in size than a typical compact P&S such as the Coolpix L22 As befitting the consumer tier, theNikon J1 comes in a variety of colors – our evaluation model came in metallic silver with matching two-tone 10-30mm and 30-100 mm zooms. Oddly, the telephoto had a lens hood, but the short zoom did not. There are dedicated hoods for all the native lenses except for the 10mm prime. The hoods can be reverse mounted for storage and both lenses have the latest Nikon “pinch-cap” versions for easy removal. Overall, the footprint occupied by the 1 Series and the two kit lenses is relatively small. It’s not the smallest ILC in the market, but it’s quite portable even in the two-kit form. The J1 with built-in flash deployed and the 30-110’s hood mounted.<query> what is the smallest nikon lens</query> The 1 Series can best be described as “pocketable,” though you’d need a large coat pocket or a modest purse or bag. Nonetheless, when compared to the smallest Nikon DSLR currently in the market – a D3100 – you immediately get a sense of the J1’s possibilities as a “carry everywhere” unit. Note the DSLR is sporting one of the smallest lenses possible – a 50mm f1.8 prime. The J1 still retains the general advantage of a larger, albeit slower zoom. The Nikon J1 next to its larger cousin the Nikon D3100 – the smaller camera is positively svelte. The front is mostly utilitarian – a large lens release button, a mostly bare gripping area on the right side (which has handling implications) , a pair of microphone inputs above the lens mount, a white-light AF assist and an IR input window round out the left the side.<query> what is the smallest nikon camera</query> While the lenses mount and dismount in the same direction as the F-mount, veteran Nikon users will be slightly put out by the need to align the lens using the large dash mounted at 12:00 rather than the more traditional 2:00 position. The rear is dominated by the large 3” display rated at 460K dots resolution, so the output can be a bit course at times. A small switch on the upper left activates the pop-up flash, which is deployed on a rather long and spindly support arm. On the right rear, you’ll find all the controls clustered together – a dedicated Function button, a vertical toggle that doubles as a command dial and zoom, and four buttons – Display, Play, Delete and Menu surrounding a combination control circular dial and a centered OK button.<query> what is the flash button on the nikon f-mount</query> Inside of the circle is the traditional four-way controller, which is marked for specific shortcuts such AE-L/AF-L, self-timer, flash mode and Exposure Compensation. To the right of the bottom plate is the combination hatch leading to the battery and SD/SDHC/SDXC compartment. The tripod mount is wisely aligned with the lens axis. The rear view of the J1. Overall, the feel of the camera is hefty, thanks to the mostly aluminum build, but a lot of the rear fascia is plastic. Nonetheless, there are no creaks and groans – everything is quite solid and well-assembled. Handling After a few minutes use, one of the gotchas of the 1 Series becomes apparent – it’s smooth yet striking industrial design exterior lacks any gripping areas for positive handholding.<query> what is the j1 camera</query> The more expensiveV1 features a minimal vertical “bar” on the right front that acts a friction point for your forefingers, but the J1 is completely bare in this regard. Nikon sells a dedicated GR-N2000 add-on handle, but it’s hard to take seriously at almost USD70 street. Several third party grips have become available at half the cost, and seem to do a much better job. The rear is a bit tight on grip space as well, as there is a small padded area available for your thumb right next to the mode dial, but should have been placed just a little bit higher for more optimal fit. Your other hand will likely be occupied supporting under the bottom plate and the mounted manual zoom lens. That’s not to say you can’t do the “one-hand” shooting style with this camera; it’s just that you won’t be doing it that often.<query> what is the nikon j1</query>"

I have worked with stallions who were allowed to interact normally with other horses, turned out in green pastures to play, and given demanding work schedules at high levels of training. These horses were intelligent, sane and an absolute pleasure to work with. I have also been in a barn where every one of the horses demonstrated neurotic behavior. These poor animals were so carefully protected in the name of performance in the show ring that their lives consisted of little more than being held hostage in a beautifully maintained cell. A review of child development books and theories reveals that an important key to well adjusted, productive and healthy children is a wide ranging exposure to a variety of people and relationships, environments, activities and ideas.<query> what is neurotic behavior in horses</query> It is hard to imagine any rational person advocating that children be isolated and sensory deprived so that they could achieve better grades or respond more perfectly to their parent's desires. And it takes very little imagination to grasp what the effects of such isolation might be on the average child. Consider the concept that dogs should have limited, if any, play or social interactions with other dogs. The rationale here is that a dog dealing with another dog must either be dominant or submissive. In having to learn the rules of normal dog behavior, these trainers believe that these dogs will have their fragile egos irreparably damaged by having to submit to other dogs, or become unduly dominant, thus rendering them incapable of successful competitive work. Does this really make sense? What happened to stable dogs who can actually deal with life?<query> why do dogs have to be dominant</query> I read one article where the author carefully explained how each new group of dogs required a sorting of social hierarchy, and that if the that group changed at all, the dogs would need to sort it out all over again. What a surprise! Every time you (also a social animal subject to power structures and dominance hierarchies) enter a room of other people, the same process repeats itself. It is through such repeated interactions and sorting that you come to some sense of who you are no matter what group you are in. The most confident dogs I know are dogs who extremely well socialized, and able to handle themselves in almost any setting. There is a grain of truth here - a very small grain at best. There is no question that an inappropriate playmate can scare the pants off a dog (especially a puppy), sometimes leaving a serious and lasting impression.<query> why are dogs so confident</query> There is no question that a dog who is an absolute bully with other dogs may make a lousy competitive dog - lacking respect or sense or both, no doubt he could be found wanting when it comes to respecting and cooperating with a human. But the larger truth here is that a normal dog who is properly and thoroughly socialized, allowed to develop appropriate manners, and who knows when to politely bow deep and when to hold his head high is a dog who is not easily shaken by odd encounters. What these trainers fear most of all is that their dog will come to prefer dogs as playmates rather than the handler. They will even tell you this in no uncertain language. My question is, if the dog would rather play with another dog than work with you, doesn't that tell you something? If your spouse preferred to spend his/her weekends with another man/woman, wouldn't that be a clue?<query> what is a dog that is a playmate</query> Let's pretend that you adore checkers, and attend every checkers tournament that comes to town. One day, you decide that your child/spouse/friend (choose one) should also enjoy checkers as you do. As you sit enraptured by the fine points of multiple jumps, your guest sees a squirrel in the tree outside the window. ""Gosh,"" he/she says as they leap from their seat, ""I didn't realize there were squirrels around here!"" And off they go to stare up a tree, finding this much more fun than watching checkers with you. BIG hint there, eh? It is possible to have a relationship based on mutual respect, free from anything that remotely resembles sensory deprivation, and still have a dog who will work his heart out for you and even more importantly, with you.<query> can you have a dog with you</query> Since I do not choose to compete in the obedience ring, there are some readers who, mistakenly equating titles achieved with knowledge earned, will question my basis for this statement. In my many years of involvement with dogs, it is the two plus years of working with my dog as a Search & Rescue team that has taught me the most about what is possible between a dog and a human in a working relationship. On our first official search, what few joys the formal obedience ring held for me evaporated in a moonlit cornfield somewhere in Pennsylvania as I watched my dog work and work and work, with me, off lead under bizarre circumstances. . . until the sun came up. I have watched my search partner, a young German Shepherd named Chilkat, play sticks and ""keep away"" with other dogs in the search unit as we prepare for a practice search.<query> what kind of dog is chilkat</query> A quiet whistle or call brings him to me instantly ready for work, which means a scent discrimination exercise that could last up to two hours in pouring rain, freezing cold or blistering heat. Walking through a park with 7 off lead dogs, I have sent a friend to hide, and without having to dispose of the other dogs, put Chilkat on a formal search command. He is at work in a flash, ignoring even the puppy's attempts to restart their game of a moment ago. In both cases, when his job is done, Chilkat happily returns to playing with the other dogs, groveling appropriately to his elders or giving a pesty puppy notice that her manners are somewhat lacking. On real searches, I have hiked over strange farm fields in the middle of the night, watching my dog ignore other dogs, farm animals, even rabbits and deer that flushed under his very feet.<query> what is chilkat's job</query> I have watched him work for four straight hours on a mountaintop after an hour's climb (past a black bear and cubs) to our start point. His only failing in that working situation was his refusal to rest more than three minutes, a fact my weary legs found nearly unforgivable! The notion of having to artificially insure that my dogs found me incredibly interesting disturbs me. If I ever found myself in any relationship with a healthy being (human, canine, equine, or any other species) where I had to cajole, bribe, pay or take hostage my intended pal in order to assure their interest in me, I'd have to take a very long hard look in the mirror. In the case of unhealthy or unbalanced beings, such as very sick or emotionally disturbed animals or people, I have indeed made unusual foods, exciting games and/or extra attention my opening bids in the friendship game.<query> why do dogs keep their interest in me</query> And I did so with full recognition that as they were at that moment, a normal relationship was not possible, and that I chose to interact with them in an unbalanced way. But I did not withhold normal food, access to independent play or playmates, or my attention. That is not a relationship, or a friendship. It may be an appropriate interaction between organism and source of stimuli, but I need more from dogs than simple, conditioned responses. I have dogs first and foremost as my friends, and I do my damnedest to treat them as such. I often fail to be as generous and unflagging a friend to my dogs as they are to me. But I'm learning. The dog is commonly referred to as ""man's best friend."" I wish that dogs could talk, if only to gain their perspective on what that really means for them.<query> what is the relationship between a dog and a human</query> Perhaps, like the hostages in Stockholm, some of our dogs would find themselves pleading for leniency for their captors.

Then this article is for you!! The ""pit bull"" dog movement has become so entrenched in the idea of ""protecting"" the dogs and operating out of fear/worst-case-scenarios that we sometimes end up denying ""pit bull"" dogs the the basic experiences and socialization that every dog needs and deserves. In a self-fulfilling prophecy, we become so consumed with fear that we end up creating the very same behaviors we wanted to prevent. This is not protection. Surely there are some dogs (of all breeds) who will never exist peacefully with other dogs, regardless of how much socialization and training is done, but those dogs are the minority.<query> why are pitbull dogs considered pets</query> It's time to stop letting fear dictate our ""protection"" of ""pit bull"" dogs. This article, although intended for any breed/mix of dog, offers some great food for thought. (Above caption taken from Animal Farm's facebook page https://www.facebook.com/animalfarmfoundation) Of Hostages & Relationships Do you need to isolate a dog or limit playtime with other dogs or people? by Suzanne Clothier He said that he loved her. He said that his relationship with her mattered almost more than anything else in his life. He said that he enjoyed working with her, and sharing new ideas. To be sure, she never took her eyes off his face, paying no heed to the audience who waited breathlessly to hear his secrets for such adoration, such undivided attention. ""First"", he said, ""I never let her talk to anyone but me.<query> what kind of dog is a pit bull</query> When I leave for work, I lock her in a room, which is pretty boring for her, but when I get home - oh, is she ever glad to see me! If she wants to do anything, except go to the bathroom, she has to do it with me. I control her food, her exercise and all her activities. Wherever we go, I insist that she always look at me, so I know for sure she's paying absolute attention. I don't let her have any friends, because they might distract her or use up the energy she needs for working. Being the only social contact she has, I am very important to her. Naturally, she'd rather be with me than anyone else."" The audience didn't gasp. They didn't protest in any way.<query> why do i lock my daughter in a room</query> They didn't stand up and tell him that was archaic, outrageous treatment. They did not shout out that this was not, could not be, the secret of a healthy, happy relationship. Instead, they nodded, and took notes. They thought this made perfect sense. Was this some sensationalistic talk show featuring, ""Taking A Hostage - Key to a Happy Relationship?"" Unfortunately, it was not Geraldo or Sally. This was a dog training seminar, and ""he"" was talking about ""her"" - his dog. (And while I say ""he"", this attitude is certainly not limited to male trainers but applies equally to female trainers.) If this had been a man talking about his wife, or a mother discussing how she raised her kids, the audience would have been, rightfully, appalled.<query> who is taking hostage</query> But it was, after all, only a dog, and these were techniques helpful to top competitive performance. If we examine the theories behind the methodology, we come up with some pretty scary notions. While long appalled by the notion of needing to isolate a dog to improve his willingness to work with you, I began to wonder why this concept not only was ""successful"" (if, in defining success you are willing to discard a healthy, normal relationship and focus only on competitive performance) but sounded vaguely familiar. The answer? ""The Stockholm Syndrome,"" a psychological phenomenon named after the people in a Stockholm bank who were held hostage. In this syndrome, those forcibly taken hostage, surprisingly, develop positive feelings for their captors. To understand the Stockholm Syndrome, you must understand the effects of sensory deprivation.<query> what is stockholm syndrome</query> Imagine, if you can, being forcibly removed from your daily life (with all its familiar environments, routines and social interactions) and put in a strange place from which you cannot escape. Your only interactions are with your captors, whose behavior can be capricious - that is, beyond your ability to understand why or when they may choose to do something for you, with you or to you. They may withhold food and/or water, in order to raise its value to you in order to receive your compliance with their demands. You may be left in complete silence or darkness with nothing to do, nowhere to go. You may not be allowed to talk or interact with other prisoners. It would appear that a reasonable (human) response to this would be anger. To be sure, this is often the initial response of any hostage.<query> what is the capricious behavior of a hostage</query> Yet, as the hostages in the Stockholm bank demonstrated, the desire for survival quickly supercedes hostility. Your entire world now revolves around your captor(s), and within the sensory vacuum in which you now exist, their moods and actions become all consuming. Anticipating their desires, appeasing them - these are the possible keys to survival. Further, deprived of normal social interaction, you begin to see your captors more sympathetically. In the original Swedish case, investigators were astonished to hear the freed hostages asking for leniency for their captors. For any social creature (man, whales, gorillas, wolves, horses, dogs, chimpanzees, dolphins), the quickest way to create neurosis and abnormal behaviors is social isolation and a sterile sensory environment. Within the zoological community, the greatest success rates in terms of animal mortality, health and normal breeding and rearing of offspring occurs with animals who are allowed normal social groups and interactions, and whose environments are as varied and rich as a zoo can manage to provide.<query> what is the quickest way to create neurosis in animals</query>"

""hdc1""--third IDE hard drive, first partition, etc. SCSI drives have analogous names but start with the letters ""sd"" (=""SCSI drive""), followed by the letter indicating the SCSI interface and by the number indicating the SCSI device id. For example, ""sda4"" means ""first SCSI interface, id number 4"".<query> what is the hda1</query> If you have an external zip drive attached to your parallel port, it will appear as SCSI device ""sda4"" (zip drives work in a SCSI-emulation mode). The listing of partitions that your Linux setup program presents to you during installation will include any MS Windows partitions which you have. For example, I have the following MS Windows partition: mount point type size comment [no mount] vfat 1200 MB [""Win C drive, hda1] /mnt/dos_hdd2 vfat 1600 MB [""Win D drive, hdd2] Don't erase these MS Windows partitions during your Linux installation if you want a dual boot. If you erase the MS Windows partition, MS Windows is gone from your system! If not sure, backup your data from your MS Windows partitions before Linux installation. ""msdos"", ""fat"" and ""vfat"" and ""ntfs"" are typical filesystems used by DOS and MS Windows 3.x/95/98/NT.<query> what is linux partition</query> As a quick reference, here is a brief summary of the standard linux partition types (""filesystems"") with a short description. I copied the info from the linux manual pages:man fs and man mount (with some additions after I had a look at the source code files at /usr/src/linux/fs). The underlined filesystems are the ones that you are more likely to use. Other filesystems (not listed below) are available as add-ons (for example journaling filesystems, compressed, encrypted, ...). minix is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks. ext is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.<query> what is the filesystem for linux</query> It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (ext2) and will eventually be removed from the kernel. ext2 is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the filesystems supported under Linux. In short, ext2 is the main (default, typical) Linux filesystem. ext3 is an extension of the ext2 filesystem with journaling. It is backwards and forward compatibile with ext2. It means that ext2 can be converted into ext3 without reformatting or data loss (just re-mounting the partion is required). ext3 can be changed back to ext2, also without data loss. I use ext3 extensively since Oct.2001--it is simple and trouble-free.<query> what is ext3</query> It is included as an installation ""option"" since RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. It is highly recommended that you use this filesystem. xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The xia filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is used infrequently. msdos is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8 characters followed by an optional period and 3 character extension. umsdos is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS. vfat is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.<query> what is msdos</query> VFAT adds capability for long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem. proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take up disk space. Seeman 5 proc. iso9660 is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard. Two extensions (listed below) are automatically supported. High Sierra --Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. Rock Ridge --Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.<query> what is iso9660</query> It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation. sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS. nfs is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers. smb is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by MS Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs. [Standard linux command ""smbmount"" will also do.] ncpfs is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.<query> what is linux smb</query> devpts--is a pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/ . fat --is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems. UFS --is a file system widely used in different operating systems. swap--is a special partition type used for swapping data from memory to hard drive. raiserfs--is a brand new journaling filesystem available as standard with Linux kernel version 2.4.1 up (January 2001). hfs (=hierarchical files system)--MacIntosh filesystem. It is a late beta version. , i.e., not recommended for use with critical data, unless read-only.<query> what is pts</query> ntfs--MS Windows NT filesytem.

Linux Applications • 7. Learn Linux Commands • A. How to Upgrade Kernel? Before Linux installation, you might really want to know what a hard drive partition is. The concern is that you delete your MS Windows partition when you really don't want to--you want two separate partitions to dual boot. This means: MS Windows is on one partition, Linux is on a separate partition. You do not normally install Linux on free space on your MS Windows-allocated partition(s). It is possible to install Linux on a MS Windows partition, but we do not recommend it. If you plan a dual boot (Linux and MS Windows on the same computer), first use your DOS/Win utilityFDISK to make the MS Windows partition(s).<query> what is the partition for linux</query> Leave part of the hard drive(s) unpartitioned for Linux. You will make and format the Linux partitions during your RedHat (or Mandrake or whatever else) installation. Linux will recognize the free space on the harddrive. Make the MS Windows partition ""primary"" and ""bootable"". Install, configure, and test your MS Windows before Linux installation. If you plan to run Linux only, you need just a clean hard drive (no partitions) to start with. It is possible to have only one Linux partition (plus one for MS Windows if you dual-boot). But it is better to have more partitions so that you can keep users' data separate from the rest of the operating system. This way, if something ever goes wrong, or if you have to reformat or re-install the operating system, you don't lose the users' data.<query> how to install linux on a hard drive</query> (You can perform a complete Linux re-install without losing the contents of the /home directory that contains all user data if you skip the ""re-format"" option given to you during installation. But for that, the /home directory must be on its own partition.) During the Linux setup, you will be asked to partition the available space on your hard drive(s). There are many possible ways to partition, depending on your hard drive space, requirements, and taste. I like Linux hard drive partitions like this (for a modest total of 2 GB of hardrive space which I give to Linux in this example): mount point type size / ext2 300 MB /usr ext2 1200 MB /home ext2 380 MB swap swap 120 MB In the above example, I dedicate 300 MB for the root partition that holds the base of the Linux operating system.<query> how much space does linux need</query> I allocate 1200 MB to the mount point that will be visible on my filesystem as the/usr directory and will contain the user's programs (the programs that don't come with the base operating system and I install later, for example StarOffice). I dedicate 380 MB for the partition that will be visible as the directory/home and will contain the setting and data of all users on the machine. And I allocate 120 MB to a ""raw"" partition for the operating system to use as the virtual memory (extension of the physical, silicon memory on the hard drive, so-called swap). If your kernel is lower than 2.2 (this is the case with standard RH5.2 and earlier), your swap partition cannot be larger than approximately 127 MB. The rule of thumb is that the swap should be about twice the amount of the physical memory (RAM).<query> what is the size of a swap partition</query> If you need more (e.g. if you have lots of physical memory, or you expect to run custom programs with really large data structures) you might want to create a larger swap partition during the installation (or several smaller swap partitions) or add a swap file(s) later. 2 GB is a respectible amount of disk space and should be sufficient for users who like having many applications. (This is because Linux applications tend to be slimmer than their MS Windows equivalents). However, if you try to install everything that's available on the modern distribution CDs, you will surely run out of disk space. My experience is that however large the hard drive space, it will get filled and I regret I don't have more :-) . If my space on the hard drive is really restricted, I may consider a two-partition setup like this (for a lean 650 MB total dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 600 MB swap swap 50 MB<query> how much space do i need for linux</query> In this example, I dedicate 600 MB to the base of the operating system, applications, and user documents/data, and allow 50 MB for the swap partition (for the operating system to use as the virtual memory). The 50-MB swap should be quite sufficient for medium duty operations. The limitation of 600 MB for the operating system, applications and user data means that you will have to be very selective as to which applications you install or else you risk running out of hard drive space. Try pressing when installing the optional software that comes on the Red Hat CD--it will give you a short description of what the software does so you could perhaps decide if you really need it. (Don't worry too much if you miss something you need, you can install the missing parts later).<query> how much space does a redhat cd need</query> You can easily finish the RedHat installation with 200 MB free on your Linux partition (out of 600 MB used in this example) if you make reasonable choices. Please note that ""bundling together"" the root partition ""/"" and the /home directory will likely save you some disk space, but it is not the safest solution. It is possible to install Linux on even less disk space than in the example above, but you will have to be really picky as to what you install. For a larger available hard drive space, I may consider the following setup (for a comfortable total of 15 GB dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 800 MB /usr ext2 5000 MB /usr/local ext2 3000 MB /home ext2 5200 MB swap swap 1000 MB Please note that the the mount points can reside on different physical hard drives.<query> how much space do i need to install linux</query> Linux agglomarates all the hard drive space into a single directory tree. Another consideration when setting up the partitions on older computers (486?). Many older BIOSes have the restriction that the boot partition cannot extend beyond the 1024th cylinder on your first physical hard drive. To overcome this limitation, simply make the first (bootable) partition so that it ends before the cylinder number 1023 (this makes this partition max approximately 512 MB in size, which is plenty for the ""/"" root partition). Once Linux boots, the BIOS restriction does not matter any more because Linux takes over the hardware management and it can access the partition(s) beyond the cylinder number 1023. When installing and using Linux, your drives appear as devices with the following names: hda--first IDE drive (stands for ""hard drive a"", i.e. the master drive on the first IDE interface), hdb--second IDE drive (i.e., the slave drive on the first IDE interface), hdc--third IDE drive (i.e. the master drive on the second IDE interface), hdd--fourth IDE drive (i.e. the slave drive on the second IDE interface).<query> what is the partition number for linux</query>"

Why is a “3-way” switch? A 3-way switch enables one or more light fixtures to be operated from two different locations, for example, at opposite ends of a hallway or at the top and bottom of a stairway. The term “3-way” refers to the fact that there are three terminals on a 3-way switch, instead of the two terminals found on a standard on-off switch. What is the difference between an outlet and a receptacle? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Technically, an outlet is where a light or appliance is connected to the circuit's wires. A receptacle is the device that is often called an ""outlet,"" the cords for lamps, appliances, or other electrical equipment is plugged into.<query> what is the difference between a breaker and a receptacle</query> What is the difference between a device, a fixture, and an appliance? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A fixture usually refers to a light that is permanently installed in a ceiling or a wall. An appliance refers to almost any electrically powered machine or apparatus that uses electricity. A device (e.g., switch, breaker, receptacle) is used to allow or interrupt the flow of current through the circuit to fixtures, appliances, or lamps. If some things are not working, where is the best place to begin looking for the problem? First check to see that the light or appliance in question is plugged in securely and that no bulbs are burned out. Then reset any breakers and GFCIs that may have tripped. You may need to look for an open (loose, corroded, broken) connection.<query> what is the difference between a fixture and an appliance</query> What is happening when lights or appliances will go out for a while and then come back on their own? This usually indicates a loose connection that makes contact intermittently, as when a wire is moved or pressure is applied to the connection. Loose connections can generate heat and may present a fire hazard. You can isolate the problem by moving the lamp or appliance to a different outlet to see if the problem lies with the lamp or the outlet. How can I tell if a circuit is overloaded? The most obvious indication that a circuit is overloaded is where the circuit breaker trips and then trips again after resetting it. If you are running several lights or appliances on the same circuit, first try shutting some of them off to see if that corrects the problem. If you are running several appliances on a surge strip or extension cord, check the label for the maximum number of watts that should be run on it.<query> what does it mean when a light goes out and comes back on its own</query> If the surge strip or extension cord is hot to the touch, stop using it immediately. What should I do if a circuit breaker trips when I am using a vacuum, hairdryer or other appliance? Appliances such as vacuums or hair dryers can draw a lot of power and may trip a circuit breaker. The simplest remedy is to turn off other appliances while using one of these appliances. If the problem persists, it may indicate that additional circuits should be added to handle the load. What should I do if I get a shock when touching a faucet or pipe? If you live near high-voltage power lines, those lines may create voltage in your pipes; the power company may or may not be able to help. Otherwise, the particular circuit responsible can be identified and the stray wire located. The grounding of those pipes should be checked.<query> what to do if a circuit breaker trips</query> What causes lights to flicker? Flickering lights usually indicate a poor connection in the light or contact somewhere in the circuit or in the panel. Finding the exact source of the problem-point can be difficult. It can be caused by a bad light socket or a poor electrical connection somewhere in the wires leading to the light (most likely right at the fixture). Flickering can cause the bad connection to get hot and may start a fire. If you cannot locate the cause of the flickering and it affects many or all lights, this could indicate a bad neutral connection, which can also be dangerous. Another indication of a neutral problem; as larger appliances (washing machines/dishwashers) cycle lights will get noticeably brighter or dimmer (minor changes in intensity are normal). If you suspect this problem have either the electric company or an electrician check it out.<query> what causes a light to flicker</query> What causes the lights to sometimes go dim or get extra bright? It’s not unusual for the lights to go dim or get bright when an appliance or motor goes on or off. What causes a light, switch, or breaker box to hum? Some dimmer switches will cause light fixtures to hum. At the breaker panel, the 60 cycles per second of your alternating current can set up a vibration or slight buzz or hum in some components. Fluorescent lights, transformers, and an electric water heater can also hum. All these are fairly normal, but if the hum is loud, it may mean that the component is loose or close to failing. If a circuit breaker gets wet, it can cause a buzzing sound as the moisture is boiled off. A loud buzzing at a breaker could indicate that the breaker overloading without tripping as it should.<query> what causes a light to hum</query> Should I be concerned if a switch or outlet gets hot? Yes. An outlet that is hot to the touch likely means that wires connecting to it are loose or that the outlet needs to be replaced. You should contact a licensed electrician immediately. A hot switch is usually a dimmer switch (it may or may not still be able to dim lights). If more than 600 watts of light bulbs are controlled by a single dimmer, it is probably overloaded. In that case, install a switch rated to handle more watts or replace the bulbs in the fixture with lower-wattage bulbs. Normally dimmers perform best when they control 80% of their rated load. A dimmer rated at 600 watts, means 480 watts is all the more load that dimmer should control. For example 8- 60 watt bulbs is all that should be connected to that dimmer.<query> what is the hot switch on a light switch</query> What causes a circuit breaker to get hot? It is normal for circuit breakers to be warm when current is running through them, but if one is hotter than the others, it may indicate a poor connection. If you have been running an appliance that draws a lot of current, (a space heater, for example) for an extended period, this would be normal, but the excess heat may trip the breaker. If there is a smell like burning plastic what might be happening? If you smell burning plastic from something electrical, it may indicate a poor connection that is creating heat, and melting the plastic housing of the outlet. Turn off whatever is plugged in and remove the plug. This presents a possible fire hazard and you should contact a licensed electrician immediately. Why do some light bulbs burn out more quickly than others?<query> why does my circuit breaker smell like plastic</query> There are several factors that may cause light bulbs to burn out quickly. Light bulbs that are used more often will, of course burn out faster. If the lights are left on a lot, such as an outdoor light that is left on all night, then the bulbs will have to be changed more often. Turning a bulb on and off frequently also reduces the life of the bulb. When a fixture cannot dissipate the heat of its bulbs, it takes a toll on the bulbs and on the fixture's sockets and wires. Or there may be loose connections in the wiring of a circuit. The packaging of any light bulb should have an average life expectancy printed on it. A typical light bulb will last roughly 900 hours. At 10 hours a day, that’s three months. Less expensive bulbs may be of lesser quality and not last as long.<query> how long do light bulbs last</query> If you compute the average life of your bulbs and discover it’s clearly less than the manufacturer’s rated life, this may be caused by: Over-voltage in your house. Occasionally this causes more serious problems. You can check the voltage in your home with an inexpensive multimeter available at most hardware or electronics stores. If the voltage is 125V or higher, contact your power company about it. 7 or 8 extra volts on a 120V line can dramatically reduce the life expectancy of a light bulb. If it’s a slight over-voltage, you can buy special 125V bulbs, though they may be hard to find. The life expectancy of a bulb will also be affected by the quality of power from the power company. This includes the little surges and spikes that are better known for their effect on computers. But it also includes the basic voltage level coming to the home from the utility.<query> what is the voltage of a light bulb</query> Electricity is simply a flow of electrons. Electricity is seen in nature in the form of lightning or in static electricity, such as you might experience by touching a metal doorknob after shuffling your feet on a carpeted floor. Electricity that we use in our daily lives is produced from a variety of sources, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or increasingly from wind turbines and photovoltaic solar arrays. The power is then distributed through a nationwide grid that balances production capacity with power demand. What is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage? Voltage pushes current through a resistance, using power (wattage). What is the relationship between amperes, ohms, watts, and volts? W (volts) push X amperes (current) through Y ohms (resistance), using Z watts.<query> what is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage?</query> Many homes receive more than the average 120 volts that most bulbs are designed to handle and this shortens their stated life. A good solution to this is to look for the same bulb but with a ""130v"" rating stamped on the bulb instead of ""120v"". The light output of these won’t be quite as bright, but you will spend time changing bulbs. Too high a wattage bulb in too small an enclosed fixture (such as a globe). Because the heat cannot escape, the bulb will burn too hot, shortening bulb life. Recessed lighting fixtures covered by insulation, which blocks ventilation. Heat can build up around the bulb, causing short bulb life. Vibration bulbs in use under a stairway, on or near an out of balance bathroom or ceiling fan, or near a door that gets slammed, or any activity that sends vibration through the building can shorten bulb life Shock resistant, or “rough service” bulbs are one solution for this situation. .<query> what causes bulbs to shorten life</query> back to top GFCI Outlets What is a GFCI outlet? The initials “GFCI” stand for ground-fault circuit interrupter. A GFCI (or simply “GFCI”) outlet is a safety device that prevents dangerous electric shocks by cutting power to an outlet immediately when it detects a short circuit. For example, if water from a nearby sink is splashed on a GFCI outlet, the power would be cut to the outlet before a person could be shocked or electrocuted. In the home, GFCI outlets and breakers are typically found in kitchens, bathrooms and other locations where water is present. What does the light on a GFCI outlet indicate? Some newer GFCI outlets have lights, which may indicate different things on different brands. On some brands the light indicates that the GFCI is tripped and needs to be reset.<query> what is gfci</query> On other brands, the reverse is true, and the light indicates that the outlet is live. Can a circuit fail without tripping a breaker or a GFCI? Yes. A circuit can fail if a connection at the breaker or at the circuit's neutral wire in the electrical panel comes loose or deteriorates. More often these ""opens"" involve less than the entire circuit because a connection somewhere on the circuit—at another outlet box for example—has failed. Why won't a GFCI reset? A GFCI may fail to reset because of a ground-fault occurring at another outlet that is wired in sequence with the GFCI. A single GFCI device can protect as many as three additional outlets that are wired “downstream” of the GFCI. It could be the GFCI itself has no power reaching it because of a short or an open or another GFCI that is tripped upstream from it.<query> why won't a gfci reset</query> Tripped GFCIs made after 2002 cannot be reset if power is not reaching their line terminals. If a GFCI will not reset, should it be replaced? Possibly, but it is more common for a GFCI receptacle to retrip (or to not reset) for reasons other than a bad GFCI. A new GFCI installed in the same location may not reset either. There may be a ground-fault at some ""downstream"" wire or receptacle or electrical device. Your GFCI that won't reset could have been installed incorrectly recently; since 2002 GFCI receptacles have had a feature that won't let them reset if they are hooked up wrong or if power is not on. The typical service life of a GFCI is 6-10 years. GFCI outlets should be checked regularly to make sure they are functioning properly. How can you tell when a GFCI goes bad?<query> why won't my gfci reset</query> The most common way for a GFCI device to fail is that it will continue to supply power after you push the test button. When a GFCI fails, it no longer provides protection from dangerous electric shocks. GFCI devices made after 2002 will not reset if they are not receiving power. GFCI devices made before 2002, whose reset stays in, can fail to operate for the same reason — not receiving power. If a GFCI will not reset and/or retrips immediately after resetting, it may indicate a fault condition “downstream” from the GFCI, rather than a malfunction of the GFCI. What is the difference between a surge arrester and a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS)? These terms are often used interchangeably and rather loosely. However, the two terms have different meanings as defined by the National Electrical Code® (NEC®) (www.nfpa.org), their UL listing, and applicable IEEE/ANSI standards.<query> what is the difference between a surge arrester and a tvss</query> A secondary arrester refers to a surge protective device (SPD) that is listed for use ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility (the service entrance panel), while a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS) is only listed to be used after this primary disconnect. An SPD listed under UL1449 as a TVSS device must not be connected ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility. However, secondary surge arresters can be connected either upstream or downstream of the main disconnect back to top Dimmers What is the function of a dimmer? A dimmer provides the flexibility to vary the amount of light in a room depending on the size of the space, the time of day, and the task or activity being performed. Dimmers may be used almost anywhere: bathrooms, bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, game rooms, hallways, kitchens, living rooms, media rooms, or office or commercial spaces.<query> what is the purpose of a dimmer</query> What makes the lights dim? An electrical component in the dimmer, called a “triac” turns the light on and off very rapidly—120 times per second. But with a dimmer, the human eye perceives a steady level of dimmed light. The longer the light is “on” versus “off,” the brighter the light appears. Conversely, when the light is “off” more than “on,” the lights are dimmer. If the lights are being turned on and off, won’t the lights seem to be flickering? No. No matter how bright or how dim, the light level is constant and smooth. The human eye sees things after they go away. An example of this is in movies where the film is projected on the screen many times a second. Doesn’t turning the lights on and off so quickly decrease bulb life?<query> why do lights flicker</query> No. Switching the bulb does not decrease bulb life. Heat decreases bulb life, and by reducing heat, bulb life is increased. Do dimmers save electricity and/or increase lamp life? Yes. The longer the triac is off, the lower the light output, and the greater the energy savings. Dimmers can save electricity, save money and help increase the life of the lamps (light bulbs) being controlled. Dimmers can increase the life of incandescent bulbs and halogen bulbs (which are a type of incandescent bulb.) The table below shows the energy savings and increase in life of the lamp (light bulb) that can be achieved with dimmers. Percentage dimmed Energy savings Lamp life increase 10% 10% 2x 25% 20% 4x 50% 40% 20x 75% 60% >20x What light sources can be controlled by dimmers?<query> do dimmers save electricity</query> Most standard dimmers can control standard incandescent lamps that use 120 volts. Other dimmers can control low voltage xenon or halogen light sources that use 12 or 24 volts. Low voltage lighting systems use either an electronic or a magnetic transformer and there are dimmers specifically designed for each type of transformer. If the wrong type of dimmer is used, it will cause the low voltage light fixtures to flicker. Can one dimmer control both a line voltage light fixture AND a low voltage lighting system? If the low voltage lighting system uses an electronic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Likewise, if the low voltage lighting system uses a magnetic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Does dimming affect halogen bulb life? Yes. Dimming increases incandescent lamp life.<query> what type of dimmer is used for low voltage lighting</query> Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament. Lutron’s pilot test data suggests the halogen lamps will have an expected lamp life similar to other incandescent lamps when dimmed. As an example, one type of halogen lamp with a rated life of 2,000 hours dimmed to 80 V has a life extension of at least five times. Can neon/cold cathode lamps be dimmed? Yes. Neon/cold cathode lamps can be dimmed using the proper equipment. Lutron Nova low voltage dimmers and GRAFIC Eye controls are UL listed for neon/cold cathode loads. back to top Dimming CFLs and LEDs Dimming saves energy while setting the right light level to improve mood and ambiance. Screw-in compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and screw-in light emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) are a great energy-saving alternative to incandescent or halogen light sources; however, dimming them may be difficult.<query> can halogen lamps be dimmed</query> Amps times ohms = volts. Amps times volts = watts. How do I know if the wiring in my home is safe? If the wiring in your home was 1) installed by a professional electrician, 2) inspected and approved by your local electrical inspector, and 3) has not been modified or damaged, then your wiring should be safe. But, if for any reason you suspect that some of the wiring in your home is not safe, contact a professional electrician to identify and correct the problem. back to top Circuits and Circuit Breakers What is a circuit? A circuit is the actual or intended path of current between points of differing voltage. In the case of a conventional household 120 volt circuit, the path runs from the ""hot"" wire from the circuit breaker in the electrical panel, to an outlet or fixture and through a device or appliance that is using the electricity, then back to the breaker in the panel via a ""neutral"" wire connected to the grounded neutral bar in the panel.<query> what is the difference between volts and amps</query> Lutron’s new CFLâ€¢LED (Câ€¢Lâ„¢) Dimmers with HEDâ„¢ Technology help alleviate your CFL and LED dimming challenges. Challenges of dimming CFLs and LEDs with standard dimmers Energy-saving CFLs have been in the marketplace for many years but a broad range of dimmable bulbs has only recently become available. LEDs are even newer to the market and dimmable versions are also only recently available. These dimmable bulbs, especially CFLs, have historically presented problems when used on standard incandescent dimmers. Common problems include: Reduced dimming range: Incandescent/halogen bulbs will typically dim lower than CFL or LED bulbs. Most dimmable CFLs will dim down to 10% to 30% measured light output. Early versions of dimmable LEDs on the market have the ability to dim lower than CFLs and can reach levels as low as 5% to 15% measured light.<query> what is the difference between cfl and led</query> The actual dimming range is dictated by the bulb’s circuitry. Lights dropping out: As CFL or LED bulbs are dimmed, they will sometimes turn off before the slider reaches the bottom. Referred to as “drop out,” this makes it extremely difficult to set the dimmer at the right level without bulbs turning off. Lights not turning on: After being dimmed to a low light level and switched off, sometimes CFL or LED bulbs will not turn on until the dimmer’s slider is moved up. This is referred to as “pop-on,” which is especially challenging in 3-way situations where lights can be turned on/off from different locations, not just using the dimmer. Lights turning off unexpectedly: Dimmable CFL and LED bulbs can be influenced by line voltage fluctuations. As your incandescent bulbs will sometimes dim or flicker when a device such as air-conditioning or a hair dryer is used, a dimmed CFL or LED can actually turn off or flicker excessively in those situations.<query> why do cfl bulbs turn off</query> Note: Actual performance of any CFL or LED will vary from bulb type to bulb type and among different manufacturers. It is important to note that only bulbs that have been designed as dimmable should be used on a dimmer. To find out if your bulb is dimmable, please check the package, the bulb itself, or call the bulb manufacturer directly. Why do dimmers get warm, and is this safe? During normal operation, solid-state dimmers generate heat. A solid state dimmer is roughly 98% efficient—2% of the power is dissipated as heat, which causes the dimmer to feel warm to the touch. The closer a dimmer is run to full output and the higher the load (watts) on the dimmer, the warmer it will feel. This is perfectly normal and safe. Lutron dimmers are designed to the strictest UL safety standard, and can handle their full rated load (a 600 W dimmer can handle a full 600 W of power without overheating.<query> why do dimmer get warm</query> (Dimmers that are ganged together in a common wallbox may need to be derated.) What is “common neutral interaction”? Common neutral interaction occurs between at least two dimmers that share the same neutral wire. When solid-state dimmers are operating, voltage spikes occur and are transmitted onto the neutral wire. Normally this is of little concern. When the neutral wire is common (to 2 or more phases of a 3-phase, 4-wire system) the voltage spikes may feed back to the dimmers. The common neutral wire can cause interaction between the dimmers that are on different phases. The following are symptoms of common neutral interaction: Lights flicker at certain dimmer settings Lights flash to full output at certain dimmer settings Light level of a dimmer on 1 phase inadvertently changes when a dimmer on another phase is adjusted.<query> what is common neutral interaction</query> Lutron recommends the following methods to avoid common neutral interaction: Run separate neutral wires for each dimming circuit, from each dimmer’s load to the distribution panel Install a lamp debuzzing coil What is radio frequency interference (RFI)? RFI is a buzzing noise that may occur in some audio and radio equipment when solid state dimmers are used nearby. Although every Lutron dimmer contains a filter to suppress RFI, additional filtering may be required in some applications. Typical examples of RFI sensitive equipment are AM radios, stereo sound systems, broadcasting equipment, intercom systems, public address systems, and wireless telephones. back to top LED Lights What is an LED light? LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. A diode is a semiconductor that allows current to flow in only one direction. Semiconductor diodes are a junction of two materials, one with a positive and the other with a negative charge.<query> what is rfi</query> When this PN junction is applied with a forward voltage, electrons and holes are brought together releasing light energy. Hence: Light Emitting Diode. What is the difference between an incandescent bulb and an LED bulb? Incandescent bulbs creates light when current is run through a filament. Resistance in the filament generates heat, which causes it to glow and produces light. LEDs create light when power is applied to semiconductors (usually gallium, arsenic and phosphorous), which are stimulated by the movement of electrons, creating visible light. How does the brightness of LED lighting compare to incandescent lighting? LED light bulbs are much brighter than incandescent or halogen bulbs of the same wattage, but LED bulbs are not available in very high wattages. Thus, when replacing incandescent or halogen lamps with LED lamps, more LED lamps are often needed.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and led light bulbs</query> For example, replacing one 100-watt incandescent bulb may require two 5-watt or 6-watt LED bulbs. Nevertheless, LED lights can save up to 85% of the electricity used by a traditional incandescent bulb. How bright are LED light bulbs? The brightest LED bulbs produce light comparable to a 120-watt incandescent bulb while only consuming the electricity of a 25 watt incandescent bulb. LED bulbs available for standard fixtures vary in brightness from less than 50 lumens up to about 1200 lumens. The brightest LED bulbs for standard fixtures are floodlights and spotlights. The brightest LED bulbs with approximately the same size and shape as ordinary incandescent bulbs produce up to 600 lumens. Are bulbs with more LEDs brighter than bulbs with less? Different types of LEDs vary greatly in size and light output and the number of LEDs does not determine brightness.<query> what is the brightest led light bulb</query> The most accurate indicators of the brightness of LED bulbs are the measured lumens or lux. Lumens measure the total amount of light output from a bulb. Lux measures how bright the light is on a surface at a specified distance. How efficient are LED bulbs compared to incandescent bulbs? Newer LED light bulbs are more than five times as efficient as comparable incandescent bulbs. In addition, because LED bulbs direct a larger percentage of light where it is needed, in some applications they are as much as ten times as effective as incandescent bulbs, reducing energy use by 90%. Why do LEDs use such little power? LEDs do not use a filament where a conductor is heated and light is created. Filament based lighting consumes more power than the light produced. LEDs produce very little heat and do not use filaments, making them far more efficient in consumption and output.<query> how efficient are led lights</query> In addition, incandescent bulbs project light in every direction (omni directional) as opposed to LED lights which project light in specified directions (such as 20, 50 and 120 degrees) due to their package design and layout. What is the useful life of LED bulbs? High quality, white LED bulbs typically last for 50,000 hours. By contrast, most traditional incandescent bulbs have a useful life of 1,000 hours and halogen bulbs typically last about 3,000 hours. And an average compact fluorescent bulb typically lasts for 10,000 hours. In an average home, if an LED bulb burned from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. 365 days a year, it would last more than 25 years. But unlike other types of lights, LED bulbs slowly decrease in brightness over time, rather than burning out suddenly. Near the end of its service life, an LED bulb will typically put out only 70% of its original light.<query> how long do led lights last</query> Higher quality LED lights have design features that enable them to burn brighter, longer. Can LED lights be used with a dimmer? LED lights that are dimmable indicate on the package or website. Make sure you check with the manufacturer of the LED for dimmer compatibility. What is an LED driver? An LED driver is a self-contained power supply that has outputs matched to the electrical characteristics of the LED or array of LEDs. Drivers should be current-regulated (deliver a consistent current over a range of load voltages). Dimmable LED drivers may also offer dimming by means of pulse width modulation (PWM) circuits. Drivers may have more than one channel for separate control of different LEDs or arrays. Are outdoor LEDs affected by extreme weather conditions? LED lights are designed to function in temperatures from -40F to 180F, exceeding the conditions where most incandescent and florescent bulbs will fail.<query> what is led driver</query> A typical home has many circuits, with each individual circuit supplying power to a number of outlets or fixtures. A single room may receive power from two or more circuits. Technically, each loop that current makes (through a single light and its switch, for example) is a circuit, but the most common meaning is the ""branch circuit"", that is, everything fed (or interrupted) by a given breaker or fuse. Do circuit breakers ever go bad or wear out? Yes, but not very often. When a breaker will not reset, the cause may be a short that is retripping it immediately or you may not be resetting it properly. Circuit breakers have toggle switches with three positions: on, off, and tripped. When the breaker is tripped, you must move the toggle switch all the way to the off position before moving it to the on position.<query> what is the difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker</query> In addition, while florescent bulbs need to warm up to achieve full brightness in cold weather, there is no warm up time needed for LEDs. Is it true that LED lights do not attract insects? Generally, yes. Most insects cannot see the spectrum of light produced by LEDs. Are LED diodes inherently directional? LED diodes are not inherently directional. One way to boost light intensity is to focus the beam more tightly. This is accomplished with a lens that directs light. MR and PAR series LEDs have a beam angle of 15 to 60 degrees. This does not change the light output, only the direction of the light. Do LEDs produce heat? LEDs ordinarily produce only a fraction of the heat produced by incandescent bulbs. If LEDs are hot to the touch, they are poorly designed being overpowered due to improper circuitry.<query> do led lights attract insects</query> What does CRI stand for? The color rendering index (CRI) (sometimes called color rendition index), is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully compared to a natural light source. Why are LEDs different colors? The color of an LED is a function of the material used to make the junction. There are two main materials used in visible light LED junctions: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN): used to make up the blue, white, true green, and UV types Aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP or AlInGaP): used to make the red, yellow, and orange types Are LEDs available in “warm” and “cool” light output, like traditional lights? How do you make a white LED? Yes. LED lights can be “tuned” to look warm or cool by adjusting the amounts of colors in the mix or by using a blue LED with a phosphor coating.<query> what is the color of led</query> The coating emits a yellow light when the blue light from the LED shines on it. The mix of the yellow light with the blue light forms a white light. Inefficiency in the phosphor conversion is one reason that a white LED is less efficient overall than a colored LED. Some of the light energy is lost in the conversion to yellow. What is the difference between an LED floodlight and a spotlight? LED spotlights put out a narrower beam of light than a floodlight, typically less than 45 degrees wide. LED floodlights put out a wider beam of light, up to 120 degrees A spotlight is more suited to illuminating objects and a floodlight is more suited to illuminating areas. back to top Dark Sky Regulated Lights What are Dark Sky Regulated Lights? Growing populations have increased the need for lighting ten-fold in the past 25 years.<query> what is the difference between a led floodlight and led spotlight</query> “Dark sky” regulations are intended to reduce “light pollution” caused by the over-lighting of various places in the city such as streets, parking lots, and decorative lighting. What is light pollution and why is it important? Light pollution indicates wasted energy. Light pollution blocks the view of stars and other celestial bodies. Light pollution is not limited to big cities, and is a concern beyond astronomers and dark sky enthusiasts. You experience light pollution when you can’t sleep at night because of a neighbor’s outdoor light, when a driver’s headlights are too intense for your dark-adjusted eyes and the glare becomes blinding, and can also have an adverse effect on wildlife. Dark sky regulated lights cut glare and prevent light trespass that will reduce sky glow and thus waste less energy. Glare, light trespass and sky glow are those components of wasted for outdoor lighting.<query> why is it important to have a dark sky</query> What is glare? Glare affects motorists at night when the high-beam lights of an oncoming car makes it difficult to see. Resolve this by aiming lights down or using a visor to shield the light from people’s eyes. What is light trespass? Light trespass refers to bright light that intrudes on neighboring property. An example would be light from a commercial parking lot that shines into a window or back yard, limiting the use of the yard in the evening. Dark sky regulations require the lights to be aimed down or shielded so the light is limited to a specific spot, or motion sensors. This also affects wildlife. What is sky glow? People living in large cities rarely see the dark night sky because of sky glow. Sky glow can adversely affect wildlife and limit the enjoyment of the night sky.<query> what is the definition of light trespass</query> Sky glow, virtually always indicates wasted energy. Properly installed outdoor lighting will prevent this. (For more information on dark sky regulations, visit www.darksky.org). What is being done to address the problem? Many neighborhood associations and community leaders are trying to preserve our natural dark skies, especially in areas near wildlife and state parks. Many communities are passing legislation to regulate the use and design of outdoor lighting. Such lighting equipment is often referred to as Dark Sky Compliant, Cut-off Lighting, Friendly Lighting or Good Neighbor Lighting, Dark Sky Regulated. These names all refer to fixtures that are designed to reduce upward light reflection, glare, trespassing light, inefficient energy use and urban sky glow. The lighting industry has responded by creating light fixtures that consumers can easily install with little modification to their existing systems.<query> what is the purpose of the light fixture</query> This response has allowed dark sky compliance to be more accessible to the general public. Simple technologies and modifications to outdoor fixtures like motion-sensor activated flood lights, timers; hoods and reflectors even using focused lights in lower wattages can help. back to top Energy Star What is Energy Star? Energy Star is a government program dedicated to awareness and the promotion of energy efficient products for both consumers and manufacturers. The Energy Star program is administered jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Energy Star identifies and recommends products with the highest industry standards of quality and low-energy consumption. Products with the Energy Star label use less energy and therefore save the user money on electricity. For example, on average, fluorescent lights use only 2/3 as much energy as their incandescent counterparts, and some last up to 10 times longer.<query> what is energy star</query> The extra accost of compact fluorescent bulbs will be exceeded in cost savings over the life of the bulb. In addition, because Energy Star products use less energy, they also help reduce air pollution from power generators. (For more information visit:www.energystar.gov.) Doesn’t energy efficient equal ugly, industrial and bulky? No. More efficient lighting does not mean less light or less attractive lighting. New lighting technology provides both equal illumination and the choice of “warm” or “cool” light available in traditional lighting. Some early models of efficient lights featured large, bulky bulbs and humming ballasts, but these problems are all in the past. Energy efficient lighting is now available in almost any style and for any application, and new technologies such as LED lights are becoming more common and more affordable every day.<query> why are energy efficient bulbs used</query> Is energy efficient lighting as safe as traditional lighting? Yes. In addition, fluorescent and LED lights are much cooler to the touch than regular halogen and incandescent lights and thus are less of a fire hazard. What else can I do to be more energy efficient? Research energy efficient solutions available in your community. Many communities now issue rebates or other incentive including free upgrades to switch over to more energy efficient fixtures. Many local environmental agencies provide consumer tips on saving energy and money. Small modifications such as timers, motion-sensors, photo-cells as well as solar energy can help the environment. Simply shutting off a light when you leave the room makes a great difference if a million people do it. Especially in the summer and winter months, there are high demands on electricity. Small things like installing a ceiling fan and reversing the fan’s direction during the winter months to distribute trapped heat from the ceiling.<query> what is the best way to conserve energy</query> In the summer, cool only those areas of the house that are actually in use. back to top Smoke Alarms Why should my home have smoke alarms? In the event of a fire, properly installed and maintained smoke alarms provide an early warning so people can escape in time. Smoke alarms are one of the most effective safety devices you can buy and install to protect yourself, your family and your home. What types of smoke alarms are available? There are many different brands of smoke alarms on the market but they fall under two basic types: ionization and photoelectric. Ionization alarms sound more quickly when a flaming, fast moving fire occurs. Photoelectric smoke alarms are better at sensing smoldering smoky fires. There are also combination smoke alarms, called dual sensor smoke alarms, that combine ionization and photoelectric into one unit.<query> what type of alarms are there</query> If the breaker will not reset after repeated attempts, it is best to call a professional electrician. How much area can be served by one circuit? How many outlets can be wired on one GFCI? A 15-amp circuit should not serve over more than 600 square feet of a home. A 20-amp circuit should not serve more than 800 square feet. Some GFCI manufacturers recommend no more than eight outlets downstream. A lengthy series of GFCI loads can trip the GFCI. If that is suspected, each such load outlet could be given its own GFCI receptacle, connected to protect only itself. What is the difference between hot, neutral, and ground wires? Typical electrical cable includes a minimum of three wires: hot, neutral, and ground. The “hot” wire, which is usually black in color, carries current from the power source, such as a home’s electrical panel, to a switch, outlet or fixture.<query> how many outlets can be on a gfci</query> Because both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms are better at detecting distinctly different yet potentially fatal fires, the U.S. Fire Administration recommends the installation of both ionization and photoelectric or dual sensor smoke alarms. In addition to alarms that provide an audible warning, there are alarms people with hearing disabilities. These alarms may use strobe lights that flash and/or vibrate to alert those who are unable to hear standard smoke alarms when they sound. Where should smoke alarms be placed? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Since smoke and many deadly gases rise, smoke alarms are usually installed on the ceiling or high on a wall close to the ceiling. Smoke alarms should be installed on every level of the home, including the basement. For extra safety, install smoke alarms both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Are smoke alarms hard to install?<query> where should smoke alarms be placed</query> If your smoke alarms are hard wired, that is, wired into the home’s electrical system, you will need to have a qualified electrician do the initial installation or install replacements. Battery-powered smoke alarms can usually be installed with simple hand tools. Some models can even be installed with adhesives. For all smoke alarm installations, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation. In some localities, fire departments will help install a smoke alarm in your home for you. Call your local fire department (on a non-emergency telephone number) if you have questions about installing a smoke alarm. How do I keep my smoke alarm working? In standard-type battery powered smoke alarms, It’s important to test every smoke alarm monthly and replace the batteries with new ones at least once a year.<query> how to install a smoke alarm</query> The whole unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. Helpful tip: Choose a day that is easy to remember, such as a holiday or birthday and replace the batteries each year on that day. Most smoke alarms make a “chirping” sound to signal that the batteries need to be replaced. Smoke alarms powered by long-lasting batteries are designed to replace the entire unit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Hard wired smoke alarms may or may not have battery backup. For hard-wired, battery back-up smoke alarms, just as with a battery-only model, the batteries should be checked monthly, and replaced at least once per year. The entire unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. How long do smoke alarms last? Most alarms installed today have a life span of about 8-10 years.<query> how often should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> After this time, the entire unit should be replaced. It is a good idea to write the date of purchase with a marker on the inside of your alarm so you will know when to replace it. Some smoke alarms have the date of manufacture printed on a label inside the unit. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for replacement. What if the alarm goes off while I’m cooking? Do not disable the smoke alarm if it goes off because of cooking or other non-fire causes. Instead, fan the air near the smoke alarm, leaving the batteries in place. If this happens often, the alarm may need to be moved to a new location. Some of the newer models have a “hush” button that silences nuisance alarms. Also consider a photoelectric smoke detector for this area. The U.S. Fire Administration recommends the following fire safety and prevention practices.<query> when should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> Plan and practice escape plans several times a year and designate a safe meeting place. Never change your meeting place. Make sure your whole family knows when and how to call emergency telephone numbers from outside the house or neighbors. Install a fire extinguisher on each floor of the house and learn how to use it. Install carbon monoxide detectors. If you are building a new home or planning a major remodel, consider installing residential fire sprinklers. Contact your local fire department on a non-emergency phone number is you need help or have questions about fire safety in your home. back to top Carbon Monoxide What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, invisible gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels such as natural gas, propane, wood, charcoal, gasoline, kerosene, and oil.<query> what is the difference between carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide</query> In the home, carbon monoxide can be formed from the incomplete combustion from any flame-fueled (i.e., not electric) device, including ranges, ovens, clothes dryers, furnaces, fireplaces, grills, space heaters, and water heaters. Furnaces and water heaters may be sources of carbon monoxide, but if they are vented properly the carbon monoxide will escape to the outside. Open flames, such as from ovens or ranges, are the most common source of carbon monoxide. Vehicles are the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning. Running a car in a closed garage—especially an attached garage—can be extremely dangerous. If you are doing mechanical work on a car in a garage, leave the overhead door open or attach an air hose to vent the exhaust to the outside. How do carbon monoxide detectors work? Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time.<query> what is the most common source of carbon monoxide</query> Carbon monoxide can harm you if you are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide in a short period of time, or to lower levels of carbon monoxide over a long period of time. Carbon monoxide detectors require a continuous power supply, so if the power cuts off then the alarm becomes ineffective. Models are available that offer back-up battery power. Why is carbon monoxide dangerous? When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it interferes with the oxygen transport and gas exchange abilities of red blood cells. Low levels of carbon monoxide poisoning cause symptoms similar to those of the flu or a cold, including shortness of breath on mild exertion, headaches and nausea. Higher levels of poisoning lead to dizziness, mental confusion, severe headaches, nausea, and fainting on mild exertion. Ultimately, carbon monoxide poisoning can result in unconsciousness, permanent brain damage and death.<query> why is carbon monoxide dangerous</query> Carbon monoxide detectors are set to sound an alarm before the exposure to carbon monoxide would present a healthy adult. Babies, children, pregnant women, people with circulatory or respiratory ailments, and the elderly are more sensitive to carbon monoxide than healthy adults. Where should I place a carbon monoxide detector? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Because carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air and also because it may be found with warm, rising air, detectors should be placed on a wall at least five feet above the floor or on the ceiling. Do not place the detector near a fireplace or flame-producing appliance, such as a gas stove. A carbon monoxide detector should be installed on each floor of the house, especially near sleeping areas. What do I do if the alarm sounds? The alarm is designed to go off before you experience symptoms.<query> where should carbon monoxide detectors be placed</query> Silence the alarm, get all members of the household to fresh air, and if anyone is experiencing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, call 911. If no one has symptoms, ventilate the building, identify and remedy the source of the carbon monoxide before returning inside and have appliances or chimneys checked by a professional. How often should a carbon monoxide detector be replaced? The average life span of many carbon monoxide detectors is about two years. Be aware that the “test” feature on many detectors checks the functioning of the alarm but not the ability of the detector to detect carbon monoxide. Some detectors last longer than others, indicate when they need to be replaced, and have power supply backups. When purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, consider not only the number and type of possible carbon monoxide sources, but also the construction of the building.<query> how often should carbon monoxide detectors be replaced</query> Newer buildings may have more airtight construction and may be better insulated, which makes it easier for carbon monoxide to accumulate. back to top Attic Fans How do I calculate the size fan I need for an attic? Measure the square footage of your attic (length X width) and multiply that figure by 0.7. This will give you the minimum CFM (cubic feet per minute—the measure of air volume moved by the fan) rating required for your attic. Add 15 percent for dark covered roofs. Choose a fan with a CFM rating appropriate for your attic size to ensure adequate ventilation. How much free area air intake is needed for an attic fan to work properly? Divide the CFM required by 300 and then multiply the result by 144 (one square foot, in inches) to give you the square inches of free air area required.<query> how to calculate attic fan size</query> The neutral wire, which is usually white in color, carries current back to the electrical panel. (Recall that electricity needs to flow in a circular path.) The ground wire, which is usually bare of insulation, carries no current at all under normal circumstances. The ground wire is there for safety. It provides an alternative route for current and allows the current to be discharged into the ground in case there is a short circuit. Why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester? When a neutral wire is not continuous back to the panel as it should be, the current of the hot wire goes through anything that is ready to run (but won't) and shows up on the normally-neutral wire. What is the difference between an open, an overload, a short, and a ground-fault?<query> why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester?</query> How do I calculate the existing free air in my attic? If you have eave vents or gable vents, multiply the length by width of each vent to get the square inches, (if the opening is covered with a screen, divide by 2) The net free area may be stamped on the frame of the vent. Add up all the totals from all of the vents to get your total existing free air area. If there is not enough free air area in the attic, additional vents should be added to ensure that the attic fan is working at optimal efficiency. Do attic exhaust fans come with a thermostat? Yes. All attic exhaust fans are equipped with a thermostat. What temperature should the thermostat of an attic fan/ventilator be set on? Attic fan thermostats are usually set at about 110 degrees F., depending on the climate.<query> how to calculate free air in attic</query> If the fan seems to be running too much, raise the thermostat setting by 10 degrees. Can the dome of an attic ventilator be painted? If so, what kind of paint should be used? Yes. The dome may be painted with any latex-based exterior house paint. Can a variable speed control switch be used with an attic exhaust fan? The Broan model 72 variable speed control can be used with the Broan model 350, 353, 355, and 350 attic fans. (The model #356 cannot be used with a variable speed control.) Can a gable exhaust fan be installed on a roof? No. Gable fans are designed to be installed only on vertical locations. Do roof fans have bird guards installed? Yes. Bird screens are incorporated into the individual roof exhaust fans.<query> what kind of paint to use on an attic fan</query> Can a roof fan be installed on a vertical surface? No. Roof exhaust fans are designed to be installed on horizontal or sloping surfaces. Broan-NuTone gable fans are designed for vertical installations. Can an attic exhaust fan be installed on a flat roof? Yes. Note that a waterproof curb will need to be built so that the housing is higher and snow and water levels would not affect product performance. Can I install a dehumidistat to the attic ventilator? Yes. Use model DH100W by Broan. What is a “sone,” and how is it measured? A sone is a unit of measure for sound that refers to a comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the listening environment. One sone is the equivalent of a quiet refrigerator. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is ""sensed,"" including factors such as pitch and frequency.<query> what is sone</query> For example, the sound of a car equipped with speakers that produce very low bass notes can be extremely disagreeable more because of the vibration, than because of the actual volume of the music. back to top Exhaust Fans What is continuous ventilation? Continuous ventilation provides today’s tightly constructed homes with a relatively constant and controlled level of ventilation. Broan QT Series ventilators are very quiet and efficient and are ideally suited for these applications. Can Broan fans be mounted directly above a tub or shower? Most Broan fans are rated for use over a shower or bathtub when used with a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter). Can a ceiling fan be surrounded by insulation? Yes. Broan bath fans are designed to provide adequate cooling for motors and lighting, as well as products with integral heaters. Will Broan fans work in wall-mount applications?<query> what is broan ventilation</query> Some Broan bath and utility fans may be wall mounted. See the spec matrix for specific models. Can a ceiling fan or wall-mount utility fan serve as a kitchen range hood? No. Range hoods are specifically designed to handle grease and high temperature environments. Ventilation provided by NuTone fans is only a supplement for odor and moisture removal in the kitchen. What is ""static pressure""? Static pressure is a measure of resistance to airflow as it is pushed through ductwork. Static pressure reduces the effectiveness of the fan. Static pressure increases with the length and the number of turns in the ductwork. Learn more on the Home Ventilation Institute web site www.hvi.org. How long should a bath fan run after a shower is used? The Home Ventilation Institute recommends that a fan should run for 20 minutes to clear humidity adequately and to minimize moisture and condensation in the fan body and ducting.<query> what is the static pressure of a bathroom fan</query> Is there a timer available that will turn off a fan automatically after 20 minutes? Broan has sensing fans that detect the humidity rise caused by a shower and turn on automatically. When moisture has cleared it turns off. Some wall controls also give you the option of humidity sensing or timer control. What are the timer features? Delay-off timers automatically shut your fan off after a specified time interval. This is a useful feature in high traffic bathrooms where you may wish to let the fan run to clear moisture adequately. A timer counts the minutes of fan operation selected by the user. Where should the bathroom exhaust fan be located? Exhaust fans should be located in or near the shower or tub, and in any enclosed room with a toilet. Keep exhaust points opposite the supply air source to ensure that the fresh air is drawn through the room.<query> where should bathroom exhaust fan be located</query> Bathroom doors should not be sealed too tightly at the bottom in order to allow replacement air to enter the room when the door is closed. Where is the exhaust outlet on a ventilation fan? The exhaust outlet is the point where air is discharged through the body of the fan housing into the ductwork. During installation, the fan should be oriented with the exhaust outlet pointing toward the exit vent on the roof or wall to minimize turns in ductwork that impede airflow. Why do windows and mirrors fog up even when the fan is running? If windows and mirrors are cold, condensation can still form on these surfaces. If a bathroom is sealed tightly, replacement air may not be entering the room fast enough to displace the moist air. Fan placement can also be a factor. Fans should be located far enough from the source of replacement air to ensure the moist air is drawn out first.<query> why do bathroom fans fog up</query> Too many twists and turns in the ducting will significantly reduce the ability of the blower to remove moist air. Make sure that ductwork is as short and straight as possible, with gradual turns rather than tight corners where necessary. Why is water dripping from the grille of the fan? Dripping water can be caused by either condensation (usually due to cold ductwork or improper duct installation), or a problem with the seal on a wall or roof vent. Insulated ductwork can help solve condensation problems, and running the fan longer will ensure that moisture is completely removed from the duct. If possible, ductwork should slope down toward a wall vent to direct condensation out of the exterior vent opening rather than back into the fan housing. Can I install a heater directly over the bathtub or in a shower? No.<query> why does my shower fan drip water</query> Heaters are not UL listed (Underwriter's Laboratory) for installation over bathtubs or in a shower. Can I use an inline or multi-port fan in one large bathroom? Yes, this works the best for large rooms because you can install the ports over the areas where the ventilation is needed the most (source control). The size of the multi-port would be determined by the size of the room. Does a duct-free bath fan expel air? No. A duct-free fan only circulates the air in the room. It is not a ventilating device and does not remove air from the room. What type of exhaust fan is recommended for indoor sauna or hot tub areas? A high-CFM rated device is normally recommended for this type of application. Can I use a smaller diameter duct than what the fan is designed for?<query> can a bathtub fan be used over a shower</query> This is not recommended. Undersized ductwork will cause the fan to run harder, greatly reducing the CFM performance of the fan and create excess noise. Can larger diameter ducting be used with my bath fan? Yes, larger diameters ducting will improve the performance of your fan. What type of duct is recommended, rigid or flexible? Rigid ductwork is recommended, where possible. Rigid ductwork has less resistance to air flow and allows the fan to operate much more efficiently. If flexible ducting is used, be sure the duct is as straight as possible. Can a bathroom fan be vented into an attic instead of out the roof or wall? Never direct exhaust air into spaces within walls, ceilings, attics, crawl spaces or garages. The humidity may damage the structure and insulation. Can I use a fan in a steam shower?<query> what type of ductwork is used for bathroom fan</query> An open is when a circuit's path is disrupted. An overload is when current on a circuit is excessive. A short is when current takes an unintended path to ground (usually with very little resistance). A ground-fault is when such a short does not use the neutral as its path to ground. What is an open ground? An open neutral? Reverse polarity, etc.? Measured at an outlet's receptacle, the path (wire continuity) to the ground point in the panel can be disrupted or missing for the ground wire (open ground) or for the neutral (open neutral). When the path between the outlet and its circuit breaker is disrupted, this is an “open hot.” Reverse polarity (hot and neutral reversed) means neutral wires are connected to the side of the receptacle that is supposed to be for the hot, and vice versa.<query> what is an open ground</query> No. Since these are normally sealed chambers, a vacuum will be created. Can more than one bath fan be vented out of a single roof or wall cap? Usually not. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended ventilation requirements. back to top Ceiling Fans How high should ceiling fans be mounted from the floor? Typically want to install them 8 to 9 feet off the ground Ceiling Height 9’ 10’ 11’ 12’ 13’ 15’ Down rod Length 12” 18” 24” 36” 48” 72” back to top NuTone Central Vacuum What size power unit should I use? Power units are designed for different applications and for varying square footage requirements of residences. For greatest efficiency, place the power unit as low as possible in the system. How many inlets may be installed in a system?<query> how high should ceiling fans be mounted</query> It is recommended to keep the number of inlets to the minimum needed for convenient use. But you may install as many as you require, assuming all are in proper working condition with tight seals and gaskets. What inlets should be used? Depending on the application and the power unit model will dictate which inlets are utilized for the installation. Things to consider are styling and color. The Advantage Series offers a status indicating feature and Broan-NuTone also offers a direct connect electrified inlet. Where should I locate my wall inlet valves? If you are using one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses the wall valve inlets should be located within six feet of a household power receptacle. We suggest that you take a 25 foot length of cord or a measuring tape set to 25 feet then walk though your home and locate your wall inlets so that they cover all the areas you wish to vacuum.<query> where are the inlet valves located</query> Are Broan-NuTone Vacuum components compatible with other makes? Some Broan-NuTone's components may be compatible with other makes. Call Broan-NuTone Technical Support for verification before you buy any component. What are “air watts”? “Air watts” refers to a combination of air flow and vacuum water lift created by the power unit. The greater the air watts, the greater the cleaning ability of the system. Is it necessary to exhaust the power unit to the outside? For the best indoor air quality, Broan-NuTone recommends venting the exhaust to the outside. This is not mandatory, but is recommended for a complete installation. One advantage of a central vacuum system is its ability to vacuum up all items and microscopic particles that may not be captured by the primary filter (bag).<query> what is the difference between a vacuum and a central vacuum</query> The remaining particles will then be vented to outside through the exhaust duct. Can regular PVC plumbing be used for central vacuum tubing? No. Broan-NuTone uses special thin wall tubing that must be used to ensure proper fit of inlets, hoses and other components, and for proper operation of the system. What is cyclonic action? Cyclonic action is a special feature that forces dust and debris to the bottom of the power unit's canister, allowing the power unit to operate at peak effectiveness. What is the difference between Turbo powered vacuum cleaning heads and electric powered cleaning heads? Turbo powered heads use some of the power unit's suction to operate the cleaning head. The electric cleaning heads use all of the power unit's suction for cleaning. In order to use the electric cleaning heads you must use one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses.<query> what is cyclonic action</query> When is a power brush or power head required? Broan-NuTone recommends using a power brush to clean carpet. The power brush loosens dirt for proper cleaning and separates and lifts the nap of the carpet to keep it in top condition and proper appearance. Are the turbine air brushes operationally equivalent to the power brushes? Yes. The air-driven turbine is a uniquely designed, non-electric brush for cleaning with the central vacuum system. The electric power brush maintains constant brush action by using of the motor used to run the unit. Is a dedicated electrical circuit required for a central vacuum power unit installation? Yes. The central vacuum system requires its own 15 or 20 amp circuit, depending on the specific power unit you are installing. My central vacuum has lost a lot of its suction. What is the most likely cause?<query> what is the power brush for central vacuum</query> A dirty motor filter may be the cause of poor system performance. Other problems that cause poor system performance are leaky wall valve inlets, blockages in the intake or exhaust piping, or a blockage in the hose. Consult your owner’s manual or call Broan-NuTone Technical support for assistance. How do you remove the power unit’s motor filter? First remove the dust collection canister. After locating the motor filter, grasp the flexible band that holds the filter in place and then pull it to the center of the filter, and it should come free. If you have trouble call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. How can I clear a blockage in the vacuum system? Clearing a blockage in the system can be quite a challenge. You can rent a plumber's snake and then work it through the system piping. Sometimes a small diameter hose worked through your piping may clear a blockage.<query> how to remove motor filter</query> Why does the system keep running even when the hose is removed and the power unit's switch is turned off? The most likely cause is incorrect wiring to your wall valve inlets. Disengage one of the system wires on the front of your power unit and if the system shuts down then you need to verify that the wiring to your wall valve inlets is correct. If the problem persists, call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. back to top Service & Support Contact Support FAQs Video Library National Accounts Finance Credit Application Product Recalls Freight Claims Tax Exempt Forms Markets Construction Data Comm.

Voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when current is passed through the wire. Even the best conductors of electricity, such as copper wire, offer some resistance to the flow of current. This resistance causes a drop in voltage. The greater the resistance of the circuit, the higher the voltage drop. How much voltage drop is acceptable? A voltage drop of 5% at the furthest receptacle in a branch circuit is acceptable for normal efficiency. In a 120 volt, 15 amp circuit, this means that there should be no more than a 6 volt drop (114 volts) at the furthest outlet when the circuit is fully loaded. At what percentage voltage drop does a circuit become hazardous? That depends on several factors: The amount of current flowing through the high resistance connection The amount of resistance of that connection Proximity or contact with combustible materials Available air flow to dissipate heat What causes excessive voltage drop in a branch circuit?<query> what is the voltage drop in a circuit</query> Excessive voltage drop is usually caused by: High resistance connections at wiring junctions or outlet terminals, including: Poor splices anywhere in the circuit Loose or corroded connections anywhere in the circuit Inadequate seating of wire in the slot connection on push-in type receptacles and switches The wire does not meet code (i.e., not heavy enough gauge for the length of the run). What are the consequences of excess voltage drop in a circuit? Excess voltage drop can cause: Inadequate power, causing improper, erratic or no operation—and damage to the equipment being powered. Poor efficiency and wasted energy. Build-up of heat at the high resistance connection or splice, which may be a fire hazard. What is the difference between a switch and a circuit breaker? A switch is a device that interrupts the flow of electricity.<query> what is the cause of voltage drop</query>"

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree. I would like to take flying lessons but as I am stationed in England (not to mention my newborn baby), it's seemingly impossible right now.<query> what is the scope of a plane</query> Well that's enough about me. Basically I just have these few questions: 1. What education level is required, or preferred, to fly the ""big iron""? 2. Do most pilots start out flying small props to gain flying hours, or do some airlines offer a training program to start you out on jetliners? 3. As I am 27 now, does that somewhat hamper me because of my late start? 4. Do you have just any general tips for me to follow to achieve my newfound dream of becoming and airline pilot? Nash Hi Nash, 1. To be a pilot, a degree is preferable but not an absolute requirement. It depends on the Airlines. The Cadet Pilot or Airline Sponsorship Program is very competitive and usually the cream is selected.<query> what is the education level to become an airline pilot</query> For instance, in one recent advert for sponsorship in UK (they have stopped this program today), there were 40,000 applications for the 100 positions available. However, not all is lost if you do not meet the stringent entry requirements. In your case, are you able to change your trade to become an Air Force pilot to gain some flying experience? Most flying jobs in the military would require a college degree although there are a few exceptions. Your military flying hours are usually recognized in civil aviation. Once you have accumulated sufficient flying hours in the Air Force, enroll yourself into a Commercial Pilot's License course first. When your term with the Air Force expires, you would most likely be ready to seek employment in the civil sector as a co pilot in a multiengine transport airplane. You will have to work your way from the bottom of the ladder but you will not regret for you will learn a lot on the right hand seat.<query> how to become an air force pilot</query> Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License. Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer it take. jawed nasim , 14 Jun, 2010 +0 is becoming a pilot a big problem...? not at all....!!! hi friends, now its very easy to become pilot.. become a pilot with 200 hrs flying exp.

Pilot Career - Becoming a Pilot Friday, 09 May 2008 08:48 Hello Captain Lim, I was wondering if you would be able to give me some advice or tips on the best route to become a major airline pilot as you are. I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree.<query> what is the best route to become an airline pilot</query> thanks David , 05 Dec, 2011 +0 what to do if I want to be a pilot in Indian Air force?

Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines. If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer. All the best to your dreams !

The second thing to do is to take a trial lesson to see if you really like that environment and you feel comfortable doing this as a career, i.e. you if you want to become a pilot. Of course if you are young, then talking to the family will help, and getting their support will be important for your flying career. Also, try to learn as much as much as possible about flying and aircrafts. Learning to fly is an expensive business unless you are luck enough to be chosen for the air force to be trained as a military pilot or get selected for one of the very few airline sponsorship programs. So knowing what to expect in becoming a pilot is very important to reduce the flying training costs.

clueweb12-1904wb-28-08556,28,1,"Just as this ageism culture that is being brought in by certain countries breaking Article 33 of the Chicago Convention. What's happening is that countries are letting national pride get in the way of safety. If you don't have enough people to handle safety oversight say so. I'm sure the more well off countries would be able to help. There are several countries that hire in outside help from the UK CAA and I'm sure there are plenty that use the FAA, Transport Canada, CAA Australia and New Zealand. The idea that if you cannot oversee aging aircraft is to ban them even when they are operating under EASA registrations is ludicrous. If you can't oversee a 25 year old aircraft can you really say you can oversee a 14 year old aircraft. Problem is governments get up on their High ""its the former colonial master fault"" Horse.<query> who can oversee an aging aircraft</query> There is no shame in not having enough qualified personnel so accept that and look for other solutions. Nigeria has a 20 year exclusion rule for any aircraft even if its EU, USA but it can be waived for a ""Presidential Decree"". India has a 15 year rule. Article 33 of the Chicago Convention states that: Recognition of certificates and licenses Certificates of airworthiness and certificates of competency and licenses issued or rendered valid by the contracting State in which the aircraft is registered, shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting States, provided that the requirements under which such certificates or licenses were issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the minimum standards which may be established from time to time pursuant to this Convention. It probably does the same for Article 38 and 55. Article 38 Departure from International Standards and Procedures Any State which finds it impracticable to comply in all respects with any such international standard or procedure, or to bring its own regulations or practices into full accord with any international standard or procedure after amendment of the latter, or which deems it necessary to adopt regulations or practices differing in any particular respect from those established by an international standard, shall give immediate notification to the International Civil Aviation Organization of the differences between its own practice and that established by the international standard.<query> what is the article 33 of the chicago convention</query> In the case of amendments to international standards, any State which does not make the appropriate amendments to its own regulations or practices shall give notice to the Council within sixty days of the adoption of the amendment to the international standard, or indicate the action which it proposes to take. In any such case, the Council shall make immediate notification to all other states of the difference which exists between one or more features of an international standard and the corresponding national practice of that State. Article 55 (e) Investigate, at the request of any contracting State, any situation which may appear to present avoidable obstacles to the development of international air navigation; and, after such investigation, issue such reports as may appear to it desirable. All ICAO countries signed up for this convention so why keep breaking the rules.<query> how long does it take to amend an international standard</query> Did you know that if India's idea of 14 years old maximum was implemented in EASA Land the 90% of European carriers would be wiped out overnight. Get real people wake up and smell the coffee before you kill it altogether. If you can't do it say so and ask for help, I do frequently and it does me no harm so why should it you.

To sum up the subject, Mr Folly-Kossi believes there is an unfair competition marketing against african airline companies. The EU black list contains mostly companies that do not operate in EU sky, or no more exist if they ever existed. Still... Ethiopian and Afriqyah had crashes recently.

When the EU blacklist came out, the African Airlines Association was up in arms. Nick Fadugba,AFRAA Secretary General described the ban as “undermining international confidence in African aviation “ making European carriers the “ultimate beneficiaries” who will dominate the African skies to the disadvantage of African carriers! With 111 carriers from 13 African countries banned, the list does indeed undermine African aviation; travellers will obviously consider flying major carriers like KLM/AF or Lufthansa at the expense of the ‘unsafe’ African carriers!<query> which airlines are safe in africa</query> The list was particularly ruthless with African airlines. So what criteria did the EU use to issue its unilateral verdict? It crystallises into 3 major points: Use of poorly maintained, obsolete aircraft(Criteria used to ban most African airlines with old soviet era fleet) Inability of airlines to rectify shortcomings identified during inspections by EU Air Safety Committee. Inability of a civil aviation authority responsible for overseeing an airline to perform its task properly(Criteria was used to ban all airlines from Sudan, Iran) African airlines face safety challenges due to poor infrastructure; lack of capacity, poor oversight and policies and unhealthy finances that impede rapid fleet modernization. Also, according to David Learmount, Flight International Operations and Safety Editor, African airlines do not have the “luxury of a safety culture“ since less developed countries tend to have less emphasis on a strong safety culture in the airline operations!Africa aviation is often associated with the ""Flying Coffins"",old Soviet era Antonov aircraft with notorious safety records!<query> why did the eu issue its unilateral verdict</query> An Antonov 225 In spite of the challenges, several African airlines have earned IATA’s IOSA Certification, a global standard for airline safety management. We have compiled a list of top 10 safest African airlines based on whether the airline is IOSA or ISAGO Certified(As IATA CEO Giovanni Bisignani once advised African aviation stakeholders, “being in the IOSA is a strong argument that you have met the highest standards in safety”); number of serious incidents or accidents since 2000,no of deaths for every a hundred thousand departures.

Not a criticism - IOSA is an important tool - but a valid observation. LOSA on the other hand looks directly at the way aircraft are operated by the line crews and is far more likely to promote continuous improvement in safety. Sadly one of the airlines on the list above recently lost an aircraft with all on board.<query> what is iosa</query> Anonymous Says: May 16, 2010 3:56 AM In the last 8 years, I have made 32 trips on Afriquiyah Airways, the last was in May this year.

This high quality, wall-mount bracket is perfect for mounting very large flat panels (LCD / Plasma) to the wall. With two separate mounting plates, vertical extension arms, and a maximum weight capacity of 150kg, this model is suitable for very large, very heavy flat screen displays, up to approx 102"". This new model consists of two mounting plates, which can be wall mounted as far apart as necessary, catering for almost any extra large flatscreen TV.<query> what is the max weight of a flat screen tv</query> Extension Arms are also included, for very large TVs with very large mounting hole patterns. Each mounting plate has a built-in spirit level to assist with accurate installation. This Model Makes Installation Easy! It has a locking bar which does not need to be put into place until you are totally done with the installation. That means you can hook the TV on at the1 top AND still gain access at the bottom to attach cables before installing the locking bar. Other models can be hard to mount because you need to attach the cables before you lift the plasma up onto the bracket, which can be a lot harder than it sounds! Will it fit my screen? It's pretty easy to work out if this bracket will fit your screen: 1. First just measure your screen: as long as the outside of the screen is more than 530mm high, the bracket will not protrude from the top or bottom.<query> how to mount a plasma tv</query> 2. Check the mounting holes on the back of the screen and measure how far apart they are. The bracket will fit your screen if the mounting hole pattern is between 80mm and 800mm high (centre of screw hole to centre of screw hole). This bracket can accommodate a mounting hole pattern of any width. 3. Find out how much your Plasma / LCD weighs. You should be able to find this information in the user manual that came with your TV. The maximum weight capacity of this bracket is 150kg, so as long as your screen weighs no more than 150kg, this bracket is strong enough to hold it.

A lot of TVs are not suitable to mount so close to the wall as this bracket is because they need to vent heat.

That effort introduced the Start button, Taskbar, and other now standard icons. Windows 8 goes even further. Users will have the option to ditch the long familiar Explorer interface and work in Metro mode, which effectively turns a PC into a tablet or big smartphone. There are lots of other big changes in store--here's a look at some of the more significant ones that Microsoft has confirmed to date.<query> what is windows 8</query> More Windows Insights White Papers Creating the Enterprise-Class Tablet Environment - by Yankee Group Red Alert: Why Tablet Security Matters - by BlackBerry More >> Reports Research: Windows 8 5 Ways to Clean Up the OS Mess More >> Webcasts Overcoming Piecemeal PCI Compliance: Integrating Technologies and Processes Maximize ROI with Database Consolidation onto Private Clouds More>> 1. Live Tiles. The most notable change in Windows 8 is the addition ofLive Tiles, the cornerstone of the Metro interface. Borrowed directly from Windows Phone, Live Tiles are blocks of screen real estate that display real-time information, such as the number of new messages, from content sources like social networks, e-mail, and news feeds. Metro was built with touch in mind, and it's an indication of how serious Microsoft is about making Windows 8 as at home on tablets as it is on the desktop.<query> what is the most important feature of windows 8</query> [ How sound is Microsoft's strategy in bringing Windows Phone features to Windows 8? ReadMicrosoft Windows 8 Unification Plan: Grand, But Risky. ] 2. Faster, Prettier Boot Ups. Microsoft knows that Metro and Live Tiles alone won't be enough to make Windows 8 a player in tablets. It needs to be a lot faster than its predecessors when it comes to booting up. Microsoft promises that Windows 8 systems will fully boot in just eight seconds or less. To display more advanced graphics during the boot cycle, Windows 8 relies on new technology called the unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI) for BIOS. UEFI lets Windows work in concert with PC makers' firmware to render visually consistent graphics, such as artwork or vendor logos, through the entire boot cycle. Gone are the DOS characters that appeared during the boot cycle of earlier Windows versions.<query> what is the boot cycle of windows 8</query> 3. Fewer Restarts. Windows 7 gave users a number of options for update notifications and installation. Users could elect to have updates installed automatically or opt for notification when an update was available and choose to be notified only before installation. Those who chose to have updates installed automatically could elect to have the update occur at a predetermined time, or installed as soon as it was available. Most of those options will remain in Windows 8, with one big difference. Users will only be asked to restart their PCs so that an update can take effect once per month--on patch Tuesday. That's usually the second Tuesday of each month. There's one exception--critical security patches will trigger an update request immediately. 4. Secure Boot. In the age of highly organized attacks by hackers and privacy thieves, booting doesn't only need to be fast, it must be secure.<query> what is the difference between windows 8 and windows 7</query> With that in mind, Microsoft developed a boot process called Secure Boot, which is designed to prevent malware from infecting computers during startup, before Windows and all of its built-in security features are launched. Secure Boot works by confirming that all components contain the appropriate security certificates before they are allowed to launch. To meet Microsoft's Windows Certification requirements, PCs and tablets must ship with Secure Boot enabled. It can be turned off by the end user in PCs, but not in tablets.

Its stock touched $600 on Thursday, which represents $560 billion in market capitalization. Compare this to Exxon Mobil, with a market cap of $400 billion, IBM's $240 billion and Wal-Mart's $210 billion. Can Apple really be worth that much? The easy answer is that the company is worth whatever the market says it's worth. Well, yes, the market is right every day—but it is right only for that day. What about tomorrow?

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority. Further proposals include transformation to a Social Enterprise. These proposals provide the opportunity for future community health services to be provided through Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) ensuring better partnership working with different organisations developing healthcare services together. All Primary Care Trusts including NHS Northamptonshire will complete the transformation by April 2011.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results. Not all hospitals are able to provide this level of care or see enough patients, so it's worth travelling further to a hospital that can. It has not yet been decided where in the East Midlands these Specialist Centres will be. Each hospital has been asked if they are able to offer a specialist 24/7 service and we are talking to patients and health professionals before we make any decisions. As part of the commitment to seeking public opinion we're inviting the public to a NHS East Midlands-led workshop, where we will give an overview of the current system and outline our initial thoughts on what a new system would look like.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Incandescent Lightbulbs Are Banned! Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. By admin on January 8, 2012 in Bans, Big Government, Canada, Europe, Government Control, Green, United States Image via Wikipedia It is now 2012, and the ban on incandescents in the United States has started. Many other countries have their own bans either already in place or planned. Canada was planned to start in 2012, but has delayed the ban due to environmental concerns over the disposal of compact fluorescents (CFLs).<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> Environmental protection is much easier to control at the utility level rather than at the personal level. Thus, your personal exposure is much smaller. Getting around the ban Image via Wikipedia As far as I know, it is not illegal to actually own Â incandescent lighting. It may be more difficult to obtain the bulbs, but once you have them, you can use them. In countries such as Germany,Â incandescents are now sold as “heat lamps”. You just have to love the ingenuity of entrepreneurs in serving legitimate consumer choice. They are even donating part of the proceeds to saving the forests, for the environmentally inclined. Americans, if you want to buy incandescents, then Canada could be an option for you! Just be aware that it is still illegal to import these bulbs into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs this year.<query> are incandescent lights illegal</query> Yes, light bulbs now belong to the same category as illegal drugs and weapons! What a sad world that this has come to.Â When did we allow the government this degree of control over our lives? My personal thoughts on the ban I can’t believe they would actually ban this icon of history. TheÂ incandescent bulbÂ is an example of ingenuity and progress, and has always been used to represent bright ideas. Should we start drawing CFLs over people’s heads in comic strips? The arguments against the bulb is that it is inefficient, but this is a subjective opinion. If you live in a country like Canada where it is cold most of the year, the heat emitted by these bulbs is no waste at all. At the same time, the quality of light is also a subjective factor. Should we start banning high-end nVidia graphics cards and 2000 watt baseboard heaters because they, too, consume “a lot” of energy?<query> why do light bulbs need to be banned</query> Why not force everyone to keep their home temperatures to a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius in the winter? Surely anything more is “wasteful”, and people can always toss on an extra sweater. I am not against avoiding waste and protecting the environment. I turn down my heat in the winter and I take public transportation. I close lights when I am not in the room, and I drive a 4 banger on the weekends. I am willing to bet that I consume far less energy than the typical home. If there is a problem with energy usage and pollution, then the proper scope to address that is at the utility level. Banning incandescents does not address the problem; it only makes a scapegoat out of a perfectly legitimate consumer good and harms consumer choice. What happened to consumer choice? Image via Wikipedia I have nothing against others purchasing and using CFLs, so long as they dispose of them properly, but I believe that it is a personal choice that should be made by each consumer, and not imposed top-down by the government.<query> what is the limit on incandescent lights</query> Incandescent light bulbs do use energy, but so do 1000 other things like electric baseboard heaters, coffee makers, and computers.Â Only the consumer is best equipped to make the decisions with her money that best apply to her situation. I have used and still use CFLs, but the light quality makes me physically ill. I will only use them for garage and patio lights and things like that, where I can decide for myself that they have utility. For everywhere else, I prefer incandescents, and maybe in the future I’ll give LEDs a try, if they also have a healthy color spectrum. That is my choice.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Forest January 8, 2012 at 2:54 pm # I don’t know if I would call them a ‘perfectly legitimate consumer good’ because there are a lot of faults in them.<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> That being said it does not mean the energy savers are much better environmentally and in other ways (yes often the light from them is terrible but they are getting better). Long term the ‘legal’ bulbs are cheaper, in my experience, so from that aspect it could be a good move and it could help lower the USA’s energy output…. We’ll have to see the data after a few years. I’d be surprised if during the winter the heat from the bulbs significantly lowered heating bills so I am not sure that argument flies, again the data needs to be crunched somewhere. Ad for the ban, it is kind of silly. A possible better option would have been a tax on the bulbs which was used to bring down the cost of the energy savers but I know you are already cringing at that idea!!!!<query> why are light bulbs banned</query> Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 3:03 pm # Hey Forest, I am glad that we both believe that a ban is completely silly! There are faults in everything, but I call them a “perfectly legitimate consumer good” because on a voluntary free market, many people would still prefer to buy them. People weigh the faults and trade-offs in different consumer goods, and choose what makes the most sense. I do not have hard data on how much I save in heating from incandescents, but I can feel the heat being given off and I am sure that most of that heat is not simply being “wasted”, as is often implied. I think that LEDs can become a real viable alternative down the road. They have long lifespans, and they are capable of accurate color spectrum reproduction.<query> why are led lights considered legitimate</query> Perhaps not as smooth as incandescents, but far superior to fluorescents, and without the ultraviolet and mercury problems of fluorescents. There are very legitimate health reasons for choosing incandescents over CFLs, and there are perfectly legitimate subjective reasons as well. Who is anyone else to tell me that I am “wrong” for preferring incandescents? Likewise, others can buy CFLs, but I still think that they should dispose of them properly. Thanks for the great comment! Reply Forest January 8, 2012 at 3:19 pm # Of course, I completely forgot about LED lights, we have had that conversation before. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:26 pm # I’ll have a follow-up post soon on why CFLs suck, but LEDs can be a great viable option. Reply Darwin's Money January 8, 2012 at 4:49 pm # I’ve always liked seeing the free market dictate consumer behavior and force anachronistic technologies out of business.<query> why do people prefer incandescent lights over led lights</query> I don’t feel the benefits of newer bulbs are compelling enough to basically “outlaw” production and sale of incandescents. But, it probably scored points with the green movement. So, I guess we’re all relegated to higher cost bulbs with theoretical life-spans that we hope will pan out financially. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:25 pm # Great comment, Darwin. This is a clear example where the arguments for a ban just don’t pass muster. Even if CFLs are more “efficient” on a lumens-output model, that certainly doesn’t account for the differences in quality of lighting nor many other factors. The beauty of a voluntary free market is that it CAN account for all of these factors, perhaps not perfectly, but in a way that much more closely reaches what customers actually want. Reply 101 Centavos January 8, 2012 at 5:11 pm # Just bought a few more boxes of incandescent bulbs today.<query> why do we ban incandescent bulbs</query> I suppose that makes me a hoarder, but I need the heat output to keep the water pipes from freezing in the well house. I remember as a kid playing around with mercury globules, when thermometers would break. Who knew…? Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:32 pm # Hah! Well, you didn’t seem to suffer for it! I’m gonna be stocking up on more incandescents too, while I can. Apparently the Czech President recommended stockpiling enough to last a lifetime. That might be a bit excessive, but I will wait until LEDs or something better becomes affordable. I have no interest in joining the CFL bandwagon; I’ve been there and I didn’t enjoy it. Reply Moneycone January 8, 2012 at 7:16 pm # Nice coverage FG! A number of cities were early adopters of LED bulbs for the traffic lights.<query> why do we need more led lights</query> What are the phase-out plans like all over the world? Canada Canada has decided toÂ back downÂ from its plan to ban incandescents in 2012. The reasons cited are that there is a disposal problem with CFLs due to the mercury content, which poses an environmental hazard. The ban is still planned for 2014, so if you want to stock up on incandescents, then now is the time. China China will begin to phase out incandescent light bulbs beginning this October, and will continue to progressively ban lower and lower-wattage bulbs as time goes on. The ban will be complete by 2016. European Union The phasing-out of incandescent bulbs in the European Union is scheduled to be completed this year. United Kingdom Most incandescent bulbs are already banned in the UK; the venerable 40w will also suffer its demise this year.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned in the us</query> When it came out each bulb cost something like $400 as opposed to incandescents which were 1/10th the price! This was fine till winter struck! See, with incandescents, the heat side effect kept these lights clear from snow build-ups, but no such luck with LEDs, which ran much cooler! I found this a fascinating adverse effect of modern technology! (And hey, thanks for the mention!) Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 8:52 pm # Oh yeah at least half of the traffic lights around here use LEDs now. I think that is an application that makes a lot of sense! No snow problems because I guess the fixture itself is designed to prevent that problem (I live in Canada where we get a lot of snow ).

Yes, I too live in Canada and LED’s aren’t all they are cracked up to be for our climate. There is something to be said for the heat output of incandescents. Plus, like you say, what are we going to do with all of the bulbs that are still working right?<query> where are you buying led bulbs</query> Throwing them away is just plain wasteful. I am all for improvements but lets be smart about this. Reply admin January 9, 2012 at 9:41 pm # Completely agreed! That is why I really think it should come down to consumer choice, and a system of laws and rules that discourages pollution and imposing costs on others.

Reply Roshawn @ Watson Inc January 10, 2012 at 8:39 am # You know, I am not necessarily for the ban either. I agree that if a product is superior (& is appropriately marketed), then why do they need to ban the other products to get consumers to switch. That’s a great point. I chuckled when you mentioned that in Germany, they are now marketed as “heat lamps.” I guess entrepreneurs are employing whatever will work.

Reply Canadian Doomer April 29, 2012 at 12:10 pm # I’m laughing at the idea of the heat from incandescent lights being welcome in icy cold Canada. I can’t remember the last time I thought “The room’s cold – quick, turn on a light.” Yes, I’m being silly and perhaps it’s because I just posted on energy-wise ways to keep *cool* this summer. We replaced all the lights in our apartment with CFLs a while ago and I certainly haven’t seen a problem. Dispose of them as you would a mercury thermometer. Many of us still have those in our homes and they contain far, far more mercury (1/2 gram) than a CFL bulb (1-5 mg). It’s not a matter of finding a hazmat suit – open a window for about 15 minutes, sweep the bulb into a secure container and take it to a proper disposal place, somewhere obscure and hard to find like … Home Depot, Ikea, Lowe’s … Personally, I see this as a good change.<query> how to keep cfl bulbs out of your house</query> When I see the Hummers pull into the gas station across the street, or look at the cigarette butts outside our apartment building, I question the wisdom of the consumer when it comes to choosing the better product. Reply admin May 2, 2012 at 8:28 am # I think your comment shows that it’s really a very subjective decision. I, too, replaced all the lights with CFLs, but I switched back as I couldn’t stand the lighting. I think they’re still fine for outdoor lights and other, similar areas. I didn’t even know about the differences in light spectrum and stuff like that, but I learned about that once I did my own research. It really comes down to personal preference. Different things make different people happy. Raw energy efficiency is a poor determinant of consumer utility, as different things use different amounts of energy.<query> can you use cfl lights outside</query> The most energy-efficient lifestyle might be to go life off the land and give up all modern conveniences, but I doubt many people would derive a lot of utility from that. The balancing fulcrum should be a person’s subjective desires, moderated by the avoidance of harming others via externalities. If you think incandescents use too much energy, then the proper, agnostic way is to moderate that based on power consumption and pollution at the utility source. A ban is the wrong way to go about it.

In addition, if a new product is technologically and subjectively superior, there would be absolutely no need for a ban in order for consumers to switch to the new product. They would switch themselves, by their own willingness to buy something that they judge is better. Everyone has their own personal reasons for preferring one form of lighting over others, but here are some qualitative reasons as to why the consumers need to be forced into buying alternatives, instead of doing it on their own free will: The light quality of CFLs is inferior to incandescent lighting. Incandescent lightbulbs emit a smooth spectrum of light that is very similar to the output of the sun. Both emit “blackbody” radiation, which is smooth across many different frequencies.<query> why do we need to ban lighting</query> This form of lighting is natural and is the type of lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Incandescent lights don’t burn as hot as the sun, and therefore they appear warmer and more yellowish as compared to sunlight. Incandescent lights may seem yellowish during the day, but these same properties also cause the light to be more pleasing to the eye at night, which is when the bulbs would actually be used. The light emitted by many CFLs, on the other hand, is far inferior. Fluorescent lights work by emitting ultraviolet radiation onto a phosphor coating; this coating is then excited and emits colors in the visible spectrum. This is similar to the ways that CRT TVs work. The problem is that this light is emitted in very narrow bands, which results in a rather unnatural form of light: Image via Wikipedia Such a spiky, unnatural spectrum can cause many symptoms, such as headaches, poorer sleep patterns, or a general malaise.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and fluorescent lights</query> This type of lighting is very artificial and not at all like the lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Here is another example: Image via Wikipedia The easiest way to see this pattern is to take out a CD (a type of diffraction grating) and hold it under different types of lighting. You can easily see the jagged spectrum of a fluorescent light with this method. Here were some results obtained by using a diffraction grating: Spectra of different types of bulbs. Source: http://web.ncf.ca/jim/misc/cfl/ As you can see, only the LED comes close to a natural light spectrum, just like the incandescent. The spikes of additional blue and green light emitted by fluorescent lights may also cause problems with sleeping. Humans are sensitive to blue light in the evenings, and additional exposure can disrupt the natural sleep cycle.<query> what kind of light is fluorescent</query> (For those doing a lot of computer work at night: I recommendf.lux.) CFLs are hazardous to personal health and to the environment. Image by lundyd via Flickr Compact fluorescent lights contain mercury, an extremely toxic element that can cause significant neurological damage, especially to those at risk such as the pregnant, or young children. There is little mercury exposure so long as the bulbs are used and disposed of properly, but the problem is that a bulb can break, releasing mercury in the direct vicinity. Very few people actually dispose of these bulbs properly either because local programs don’t exist or it is too cumbersome to do so. That means that mercury can get into the local groundwater or air when disposed of in the trash and later dumped in the landfill or burned in the local incinerator. The mercury content can also be dangerous if a CFL bulb breaks and the dust is spread out over a wide area.<query> are cfls hazardous</query> When an incandescent bulb breaks, all you have to worry about is some sharp glass, but when a CFL bulb breaks, not only do you have to worry about cutting yourself on mercury-laced glass, but you also have to worry about breathing in the dust. Do you really think that people are going to be putting on gas masks and then separating the waste into a special container, which they will then bring to the local hazardous waste disposal center? No way. They will use a vacuum or a broom, spreading the mercury dust everywhere, and they will dump the broken remains of the bulb into the regular trash, where it will go on to potentially contaminate the groundwater. This has actually happened at a friend’s home. The CFL bulb did not have a screw-base, and it wasn’t properly installed.<query> what happens when a cfl bulb breaks</query> It fell out, crashing and spreading fine dust and glass bits everywhere. This friend used a broom and vacuum to sweep up the dust, probably inhaling a lot along the way, and then tossing everything in the regular trash. This is how most people are going to handle CFLs, and they will be exposing themselves and others to mercury along the way. Don’t incandescent lights actually emit more mercury? There is a disingenuous argument that incandescent lights emit more mercury than CFLs, but this is looking solely at the effect of coal power plants. This has absolutely nothing to do with the incandescent lightbulb itself and everything to do with the form of energy generation. In that sense, CFLs would also be contributing to additional mercury pollution beyond what they directly contribute. Even if you live in a jurisdiction where all of your power comes from dirty coal plants, you are probably living far away from the plant, and furthermore these plants have special scrubbers and environmental procedures in place in order to minimize the impact on humans and other wildlife.<query> do incandescent lights emit more mercury</query>"

See more stories » X In China, once-thriving Apple scalpers are struggling By Deborah Netburn March 15, 2012, 1:24 p.m. Back in the day, watching television was as simple as hitting a switch, maybe messing with some rabbit ears and flipping through all eight of your channel choices. The sound wasn't so great, and the picture was kind of grainy, but at least it was simple.<query> who is the director of google</query> If a friend was going to stay at your house for a week, you wouldn't have to prepare a four-page document on how to watch""30 Rock."" In our more technologically advanced age, however, simply turning on a home entertainment system can involve as many as three remote controls. Once your set is finally on, you're faced with an interface that is ugly and cluttered and hard to read. And watching live television means scrolling through hundreds of channels, some that you don't even have access to, others that are in languages that you don't understand. It's enough to make a person abandon her 52-inch hi-def LED screen and just watch her shows on a laptop. Somebody upgrade us! Well, both Google and Apple are working on it. So far both companies offer additional boxes you can attach to your television.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a tv</query> ButSony is selling a television with Google TV built right in, and if you can believe the Internet rumors, Apple may be launching its own television set later this year. Here's what we'd like to see: 1. One -- singular -- remote: At our house, turning on the television involves taking one remote and pressing ""TV"" then ""Power"" then ""Cable"" and ""Power,"" then turning to a second remote that controls the Blu-ray and sound system. If we want to useNetflix, we pull out the remote to our Wii. There has to be a better way! 2. A more intuitive remote: There are way too many buttons on most remotes, and the important ones like ""Power"" and ""Function"" are often not in the most obvious places.<query> what is the remote for tv</query> This needs to change. 3. One device: We don't want a television and a Blu-ray player and a cable box that we have to rent and some sort of video game system that also allows us to access Amazon Prime andNetflix and Hulu. We'd like one simple device, please -- easy to set up, easy to move, easy to control. 3. A better-looking interface: Oh, that grid! That horrible looking grid! It's so ugly and it's so difficult to read. Our giant, high-definition television sets are crying out for a graphic interface -- streamingNetflix has the right idea. It's nice to look at and easy to use. 4. A la carte channels: How many channels do you watch on a regular basis? Five? Ten?<query> what is the best streaming device</query> Maybe 20? And how many channels are bundled into your cable deal? Probably more than 100. We don't need that many channels and most of us are finally realizing that we don't want that many either. What if you could pay to subscribe toCNN, ESPN and HBO and that's it? 5. An easy to use favorites list: For those who aren't ready to give up their 500-channel deal, there should be easy an way to create a favorites list. Imagine dragging and dropping your top 20 channels into your own favorites list. Dreamy! 6. Content options in one place: There are a lot of ways to watch television and movies now -- Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. We want our new television to have all those viewing options built right into it -- no cables or extra wires, or extra devices, necessary.<query> how many channels are on tv</query> 7. No more storage limits: The ability to digitally record a show has redefined television watching for many people, but serious watchers frequently run out of memory on their devices. We'd like to get rid of the idea of storing television shows, and instead have those shows live somewhere in a cloud so that we don't have to worry about watch it now, or lose it. 8. A universal system: Watching television at your mom's house is nothing like watching television at your own house. We are capable of jumping on someone else's computer to check email real quick if necessary; we should also be capable of turning on someone else's television with out an instruction manual. 9. Self set-up:The last time we moved, we waited 10 days for our cable company to finally get us cable TV.<query> what is the best way to watch tv</query> And we aren't alone. Remember that infinitely satisfying""Seinfeld"" episode when Kramer finally got to make the cable guy wait? We'd like our children to shake their heads in wonderment that it ever took more than an hour to get a television set up and working. 10. Headphones: Well, this might just be us, but we always thought that wireless headphones would be a great addition to any television set. That way, you can watch as loud as you want and not worry about bugging the neighbors. ALSO: Apple shares hit $600 ahead of new iPad release Man sues Apple over Siri ads: Does he have a case?

clueweb12-1019wb-44-02493,88,1,"A second aspect of training is one that cannot be gained from the courses or seminars. This is firsthand knowledge of, and practical experience with, the methods of psychological investigation and study. These methods include ways of behaving with the subjects being studied. Students are provided with whatever opportunities they need to reach those levels of competence representative of doctoral standing. Continuing research programs, sponsored by members of the faculty, offer direct opportunities for experience in fields represented by the faculty's many research interests. Each student achieves competence in unique ways and at different rates. Each student and adviser share in planning a program leading to the objectives discussed. The student is expected to spend half of his or her time on research and takes no more than 10 units of course work per quarter. For further information please contact the student services office and the department graduate guide.<query> what is the purpose of continuing research programs</query> TEACHING REQUIREMENT The department views experience in supervised teaching as an integral part of its graduate program. Regardless of the source of financial support, all students serve as teaching assistants for at least five Psychology courses during their graduate study. Of the courses, two must be PSYCH 1, Introduction to Psychology, or PSYCH 10, 252 or 253, Statistical Methods. Students are discouraged from participating in teaching during the first year of graduate study. Students typically progress from closely supervised teaching to more independent work. Some students may be invited to offer a supervised, but essentially independent, seminar during their final year of graduate study. PSYCHOLOGY COLLOQUIUM The Psychology Colloquium meets on most Wednesday afternoons at 3:45 p.m. Speakers from Stanford and other institutions present topics of current interest. Graduate students are expected to attend. Additional announcements may be found athttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/colloquium.<query> what is the stanford psychology teaching requirement</query> Copyright ©2011 Stanford University | Office of the University Registrar | Academic Year 2011-12 | Terms of Use | Copyright Complaints | Report a Problem with this site.<query> what year is stanford university</query> However, an applicant should have research experience as an undergraduate, as well as the equivalent of an undergraduate major in Psychology. The major focus of the doctoral program is on research training, and admission is highly selective. Applicants for admission must submit their scores on the general Graduate Record Examination as part of the application. GRE subject scores are recommended. General University requirements for the Ph.D. are described in the "" Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. In addition to fulfilling Stanford University requirements for the degree, the following departmental requirements are stipulated. First-Year Course Requirements—During the first year of graduate study, the student must take PSYCH 207, Proseminar for First-Year Ph.D. Graduate Students, at least one approved graduate statistics course, and at least two core courses from the following list: PSYCH 202.<query> what is the requirements for a phd degree</query> Neuroscience PSYCH 205. Foundations of Cognition PSYCH 211. Developmental Psychology PSYCH 212. Social Psychology or PSYCH 215. Mind, Culture, and Society PSYCH 213. Affective Science Students in each area may be required to take up to two additional non-core graduate courses in their area of specialization. The student is expected to spend at least half of the time in research from the beginning of the first year of graduate study to the completion of the Ph.D., taking no more than 10 units of course work each quarter. At the end of the first year of graduate study, the student must file with the department a written report of the first-year research activities. Second Year Course Requirements—By the end of the second year of graduate study, the student should complete the core courses listed above and take a second approved graduate course in statistics.<query> what courses are required for phd</query> Third-Year and Beyond—Students are expected to form a research committee, which must include the dissertation reading committee, before the initiation of the dissertation research. The research committee includes the dissertation adviser and consists of at least three faculty members, at least two of whom should have primary appointments in the Psychology department. For University guidelines for the composition of the dissertation reading committee, see the ""Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. The research committee should meet no later than the last day of classes of Spring Quarter of the third year, and determines the timeline for further development of the dissertation research project. Subsequent meetings are triggered by the completion of one of two documents: a dissertation proposal (DP) or a conceptual analysis of the dissertation area (CADA). The timing and sequencing of the DP and CADA are developed by the student in consultation with the committee.<query> what is the purpose of a research committee</query> As a general guide, one of the two preliminary elements (CADA or DP) should be completed by the end of the third Summer Quarter and the second should be completed by the end of the fourth Spring Quarter. Students are free to alter the membership of the committee at any time during the process, subject to consultation with the adviser. The DP should be a description of the proposed research. The CADA provides a framework for the research topic of the dissertation, addresses the central issues within the specialty area, and reviews the pertinent literature. Advanced Course or Minor Requirements—The candidate must complete 12 units of advanced graduate course work or a Ph.D. minor in another department. If a student waives the minor requirement in favor of the 12 advanced units, the student must fulfill the advanced course requirement by taking (a) non-core graduate courses required by a particular area,or (b) graduate-level courses in other departments comparable in quality to Psychology's graduate courses.<query> what is the cada</query> If there is any question about comparability, the student should consult the adviser, student services, and, in some cases, the graduate program committee chair before taking the course. Orals—The candidate must pass the University oral examination, which also serves as a dissertation defense. A committee is formed to review the oral examination, including the dissertation reading committee, an additional faculty member, and one oral examination committee chair from outside the Psychology department. The oral examination consists of a 40-45-minute presentation to the department of the completed dissertation research. Parents and friends are welcome to attend. Following the presentation, the student and the committee convene for a discussion of the dissertation and the presentation. Dissertation Requirements—The candidate must complete a dissertation satisfactory to the dissertation reading committee prior to the oral examination. Minor revisions to formatting may be made after the oral examination.<query> how long is the oral examination</query> Ph.D. candidacy expires five years after admission to candidacy at the end of the second year of study. Reapplication requires department reexamination. STUDENT EVALUATIONS First-Year Evaluation—It is the department's policy to evaluate the progress of each graduate student at the end of the first year of graduate study. As part of the procedure, each student is required to file with the department a report of the first-year research activities. Students should discuss this report and the evaluation procedures with their adviser as early as possible in their first year. If the student fulfills the academic promise displayed upon entrance, he or she is invited to continue working towards the doctorate. The first-year evaluation is primarily based on three factors: quality of research carried out in the first year performance in courses (especially required courses) recommendations of the adviser (including a commitment on the part of that adviser to continue in that role).<query> how long does a phd candidate have to be evaluated</query> Second-Year and Beyond Evaluation—A similar evaluation is conducted at the end of each year of graduate training involving the same criteria as the first year; however, the student is not required to submit a paper. Students who are not making satisfactory progress may be dropped from the program. THE DOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM As indicated by the requirements described above, a student concentrates in any one of several areas within Psychology. Regardless of area, however, the training program places emphasis on the development of research competence, and students are encouraged to develop those skills and attitudes that are appropriate to a career of continuing research productivity. Two kinds of experience are necessary for this purpose. One is the learning of substantial amounts of technical information. A number of courses and seminars are provided to assist in this learning, and a student is expected to work out a program, with his or her adviser, to attain this knowledge in the most stimulating and economical fashion.<query> what is the purpose of a doctoral training program</query>"

Normally, at least four hours of independent learning should be in psychology. PSYC 380 Fieldwork in a Psychological Setting is a full-year course that meets the all-College requirement for independent learning, as do any two PSYC 350 courses. Alternatively, one course from the upper level research category may be counted as independent learning, provided it is followed by related work in PSYC 350. The following five core courses are required: PSYC 101 Introduction to Psychological Science MATH 118 Introductory Statistics PSYC 201 Biological Psychology PSYC 203 Research Methods in Psychology PSYC 345 History and Systems of Psychology To ensure that students receive sufficient breadth across substantive areas, as well as some depth within at least one area, the department also requires that students successfully complete at least one course chosen from each of the following five areas: Basic Processes PSYC 232 Health Psychology PSYC 243 Cognitive Psychology PSYC 244 Drugs and Behavior PSYC 247 Perception Social and Developmental PSYC 235 Developmental Psychology PSYC 236 Psychology of Adolescence PSYC 239 Psychology of Aging PSYC 248 Social Psychology Clinical and Personality PSYC 230 Theories of Personality PSYC 231 Abnormal Psychology Upper Level Theory and Application PSYC 331 Seminar in Clinical Psychology PSYC 335 Social and Emotional Development PSYC 336 Childhood Psychopathology PSYC 339 Psychology and the Law Upper Level Research PSYC 301 Research in Biopsychology PSYC 303 Research in Cognitive Processes PSYC 304 Research in Personality PSYC 305 Research in Cognitive Development PSYC 308 Research in Social Psychology Prerequisites: PSYC 101, Introduction to PSYC 101, Introduction to Psychological Science, is a prerequisite for all courses offered by the department except PSYC 220, for which the prerequisite is PSYC 101 or WGST 100.<query> what is the psyc requirement for independent learning</query> Upper-level courses have additional prerequisites as detailed in the course descriptions. Recommendations: Students considering a major in psychology are advised to take PSYC 101 Introduction to Psychological Science during their first year and MATH 118 Introductory Statistics in the fall semester of their sophomore year. In general, the department encourages flexible and individualized course planning both within and beyond the field of psychology. The chair or an advisor in the department can help with such program planning. The following examples serve as guides to planning an appropriate program. A student planning a career working with children, such as early childhood education, counseling, child guidance, or school psychology, should consider PSYC 235, 236, 305, 335, and 336. A student planning a career in a medical or physiological research setting should consider PSYC 232, 243, 244, 247, and 301.<query> what courses are required for psychology</query> Relevant courses in biology, chemistry, and computer science are also recommended. A student interested in a career in behavioral research, human factors, or computer-based instruction should consider PSYC 243, 247, 248, and 303. Relevant areas of mathematics and/or computer science are also recommended. A student with career interests in the clinical and personality area should consider PSYC 230, 231, 232, 304, 331, 336, and 339. A student planning a career in social service or human resources should consider PSYC 230, 231, 232, 248, 308, and 339. Independent Learning in Psychology The all-College Independent Learning Requirement (eight semester hours) can be met by taking two four-credit Psychology 350 (Independent Study) courses; Psychology 350 followed by Psychology 355: Psychology 380 (Fieldwork in a Psychological Setting), a oneyear eight-credit course; or Psychology 380 followed by Psychology 381.<query> what is the psyc requirement for psychology</query>"

But thanks to the January 15, 2010 release of the Ministry of Education’s new School Food and Beverage Policy (PPM 150) making responsible food choices is about to get a lot easier for students across Ontario.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> Provincial funding operates within a broader scope of contributors to deliver the program, including parents or caregivers, corporate sponsors, farmers, local charities, community organizations and municipalities. The SNP Nutrition Guidelines follow Canada’s Food Guide and apply to foods served in programs. Guiding principals for the nutrition guidelines include: promote healthy eating, prepare healthy food, respect diversity and individual needs, contribute to social development, choose Ontario food first, be environmentally conscious and practice safe food handling and storage. To learn more about SNP or to download a copy of the SNP Nutrition Guidelines please visit the MCYS website at:www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/schoolsnacks/index.aspx Another piece of the ‘Healthy School’ puzzle is falling into place... Mandatory implementation of the new Food and Beverage Policy is set for September 1, 2011.<query> what is the snp nutrition guidelines</query> By the end of the 2010/2011 school year boards will be required to confirm that they will be in full compliance. And while the planning of new menus and food options is sure to be a big job, requiring the support of the entire school community, it is clearly a change that is worth making. Not only is the availability of healthy foods in schools bound to result in better eating habits and increased concentration levels for students but, perhaps most importantly, by reinforcing the knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding healthy living that are being taught through the revised Ontario Health and Physical Education Curriculum and encouraged by initiatives such as Foundations for a Healthy School, it is sure to send a strong message to students: Healthy eating habits are important... so important, in fact, that we are willing to work hard to ensure that our school environments support us all in making healthier choices.<query> why is healthy eating important in schools</query> View All Articles Post new comment Subject: Comment: * CAPTCHA This question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.

In the News Working together for the health of America's children Public wants federal help fighting obesity Students better off with healthy-eating program Archive Ophea's Blog Featured Articles Safety Articles DPA Articles Ophea's Newsletter Sign Up eConnection RSS Programs & Services Healthy Schools & Communities Order Resources Hot Topics Privacy Policy Terms of Use Store Policies Français © Ophea 2012<query> what is the purpose of a captcha</query> Developed in collaboration with the Ministries of Health Promotion; Children and Youth Services; and Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the new policy embodies the principles of healthy eating outlined in Canada’s Food Guide, and will ensure that 100% of the foods sold on a day-to-day basis in Ontario’s publicly funded schools fall into the categories of “Sell Most” and “Sell Less” (see definitions below). What this means is that choosing nutritious foods more often won’t only be encouraged, it will become an integral part of every school’s culture—something that we at Ophea could not be happier about. “Ophea shares the government’s commitment to healthy schools and healthy communities and believes that Ontario’s new School Food and Beverage Policy is a critical step that will reinforce the philosophy and expectations of the revised H&PE curriculum,” comments Chris Markham, Ophea’s executive director and CEO.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> “It will foster a healthier learning environment and help students reach their full potential.” Good nutrition leads to better health and better learning... It’s simple enough to do the math. With 195 days in a typical school year, Ontario students are eating most of their lunches at school. Whether these lunches are purchased in cafeterias or brought from home and supplemented with snacks from school vending machines, they often include high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium, low nutrient foods such as fries, candy bars and sugary drinks. ""When our school board introduced nutrition standards in 2007, it was because we knew that a healthy diet would lead to more active and engaged students. The results have been outstanding,"" says Roger Lawler, Director of Education at the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. As the link between improved health and improved learning outcomes has been proven time and time again, and the connections between poor nutrition and chronic disease have been well documented, it’s become increasingly clear: poor nutrition is a problem that we, as a society, can no longer afford to ignore, and one that we all have a responsibility not to perpetuate.<query> why is nutrition important in school</query> Furthermore, the need to set a strong example for students by ‘practicing what we preach’ in schools cannot be understated. Through the implementation of Daily Physical Activity (DPA), the forging of community partnerships and the adoption of the Ministry of Education’s Foundations for a Healthy School framework, schools have already begun to take a more comprehensive approach to improving student health. But while positive health messages are taught and physical activity has been made a priority, the foods currently sold in schools often fail to support and reinforce what students are learning about healthy living. It’s time to make a change, and there’s never been a better time to get started! As schools begin to adopt the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum (Grades 1-8)—which not only provides information about health education but also builds students’ capacity to make healthy choices—the new policy will help to ensure greater alignment between what students are being taught and the food choices that are available, helping them to apply what they’re learning while fostering healthy habits that can last a lifetime.<query> why is physical education important in schools</query> The policy applies to all foods sold in schools... The new policy applies to foods and beverages sold on school premises for school purposes including all venues, such as cafeterias, vending machines and tuck shops. It also applies to all programs (for example, catered lunch programs) and must be enforced at all events, including bake sales and sports competitions. Exceptions to the policy will include foods and beverages that are: offered in schools at no cost; brought from home or purchased off school premises; available for purchase during field trips off school premises; sold in schools for non-school purposes (e.g., sold by an outside organization using the school gym after school hours and for non school-related events); sold for fundraising activities that occur off school premises; and sold in staff rooms. Under the policy, school principals may also elect to designate up to 10 days (or fewer as determined by the school board) during the school year as “special-event days” on which foods and beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards may be sold.<query> what is the policy for food sold in schools</query> The healthiest foods have the highest nutritional values... The policy groups foods and beverages into three categories: “The Sell Most Category” must make up at least 80% of choices offered. These foods and beverages generally have higher levels of essential nutrients and lower levels of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples may include fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits and vegetables; and whole grain breads. “The Sell Less Category” must make up no more than 20% of choices offered. These foods have slightly higher amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium than the ‘Sell Most Category.’ Examples may include deli meats, frozen pizza and hotdogs. Foods that are in the “Not Permitted for Sale Category” are generally those that contain few or no essential nutrients and high amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium.<query> what is the sell most category for food</query> Examples include deep fried foods, energy bars and candy. More information about the criteria for determining a food’s suitability can be found inThe School Food & Beverage Policy itself. When it comes to implementation, help is readily available... Throughout the winter of 2010, school board teams and principals will receive training from the Ministry of Education in how to implement the new policy, and further information about implementation support can be found at www.ontario.ca/healthyschools. As with any new policy or initiative, getting started is the hardest part. School boards are encouraged to reach out to students, staff, parents, community partners and food service providers in order to gain their support. School boards should also seek support from their local board of health, as they have been mandated under the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2008 to work with school boards and/or staff in elementary, secondary and post-secondary educational settings, using a comprehensive health promotion approach.<query> what is the ontario school food policy</query> The goal of this collaboration is to influence the development and implementation of healthy policies, and the creation or enhancement of supportive environments to address healthy eating and other key health issues (including physical activity, alcohol use and tobacco control). For more information on working with your local board of health, see www.ophea.net/healthy-schools-communities/making-it-happen/step-3. Schools and communities can also access the following sources for further information and for support for healthy eating: Eat Right Ontario – This is an initiative of the Ministry of Health Promotion. Through this program, schools (or other interested parties) can access a registered dietician by phone or by email to answer any questions they have about healthy eating. Their website, www.eatrightontario.ca, also contains a wealth of information about diabetes prevention, menu planning, and health and nutrition, as well as a listing of healthy recipes.<query> what is the health promotion program for schools</query> Menu of Choices – This online resource, published by Ophea, provides the latest quality information and supports to help school communities understand, plan and address healthy eating. The website, www.menuofchoices.ca, which encourages entire school communities to take a proactive approach to addressing the eating behaviours of children and youth (Grades K-12), can be accessed by all educators and community partners who want to help students develop a personal commitment to healthy eating. Student Nutrition Program (SNP) – This Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) program supports communities to provide nutritious food to children and youth. The program supports the healthy growth and development of children and youth by providing universal access to nutritious meals and snacks at each site so students are ready to learn. SNP is a community-driven initiative. The service delivery model is designed to encourage and facilitate community participation in the development and implementation of the program at the local level so programs can be tailored to meet the individual needs of local children, youth and families.<query> what is snp</query>"

Food Fiber Content in Grams Oatmeal, 1 cup 3.98 Whole wheat bread, 1 slice 2 Whole wheat spaghetti, 1 cup 6.3 Brown rice, 1 cup 3.5 Barley, 1 cup 13.6 Buckwheat, 1 cup 4.54 Rye, 1/3 cup 8.22 Corn, 1 cup 4.6 Apple, 1 medium with skin 5.0 Banana, 1 medium 4.0 Blueberries, 1 cup 3.92 Orange, 1 large 4.42 Pear, 1 large 5.02 Prunes, 1/4 cup 3.02 Strawberries, 1 cup 3.82 Raspberries, 1 cup 8.36 *Fiber content can vary between brands. Source: esha Research, Food Processor for Windows, Version 7.8M Whole Grains and Fish Highly Protective against Childhood Asthma<query> how much fiber in a cup of oatmeal</query> While no association between asthma and intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was found (a result at odds with other studies that have supported a link between antioxidant intake, particularly vitamins C and E, and asthma), the children's intake of both whole grains and fish was significantly linked to incidence of wheezing and current asthma. In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed. Phenolics, powerful antioxidants that work in multiple ways to prevent disease, are one major class of phytonutrients that have been widely studied. Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods. In whole grains, however, ""free"" phenolics accounted for less than 1% of the total, while the remaining 99% were in ""bound"" form.<query> what is phenolics</query> home - who we are - what's new - getting started - community - Search The George Mateljan Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation with no commercial interests or advertising, is a new force for change to help make a healthier you and a healthier world. Printer friendly version Quinoa Although not a common item in most kitchens today, quinoa is an amino acid-rich (protein) seed that has a fluffy, creamy, slightly crunchy texture and a somewhat nutty flavor when cooked. Quinoa is available in your local health food stores throughout the year. Most commonly considered a grain, quinoa is actually a relative of leafy green vegetables like spinach and Swiss chard. It is a recently rediscovered ancient ""grain"" once considered ""the gold of the Incas.""

Store quinoa in an airtight container. It will keep for a longer period of time, approximately three to six months, if stored in the refrigerator. Tips for Preparing and Cooking Tips for Preparing Quinoa While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands. To ensure that the saponins have been completely removed, taste a few seeds. If they still have a bitter taste, continue the rinsing process.<query> how long can you keep quinoa in the refrigerator</query> This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Quinoa provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System.

In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients. Because quinoa is a very good source of manganese as well as a good source of magnesium, folate, and phosphorus, this ""grain"" may be especially valuable for persons with migraine headaches, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Help for Migraine Headaches If you are prone to migraines, try adding quinoa to your diet. Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years. Arch Intern Med. 2007 Mar 12;167(5):490-6.; Eur Heart J. 2006 Mar;27(6):641-3. Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5.

Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women. (Cade JE, Burley VJ, et al. ,International Journal of Epidemiology).<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Pre-menopausal women eating the most fiber (>30 grams daily) more than halved their risk of developing breast cancer, enjoying a 52% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women whose diets supplied the least fiber (<20 grams/day). Fiber supplied by whole grains offered the most protection. Pre-menopausal women eating the most whole grain fiber (at least 13 g/day) had a 41% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest whole grain fiber intake (4 g or less per day). Fiber from fruit was also protective. Pre-menopausal women whose diets supplied the most fiber from fruit (at least 6 g/day) had a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest fruit fiber intake (2 g or less per day).<query> what is the best fiber for premenopausal women</query>"

Ever since Linux started to make some ground against Microsoft, no matter how small, various attempts have been made to guess and second-guess what response the Beast of Redmond is likely to take.

We think that what Microsoft has done so far is a first-rate example of a typical quick-fix: try some FUD, dismiss the ""problem"" in disparaging terms, try not to let it gain credence in the minds of the captive customers and hope and pray that it will just go away.<query> what is the microsoft response policy</query> The latter — hope it goes away - is usually a good tactic. Seasoned managers the world over know that this works well about ninety percent of the time. It's commonplace for this month's panic to evaporate of its own accord a few weeks later. A policy of relative inaction is often a good one. Microsoft's difficulty is that Linux is far from going away, but gaining visibility by the day. Linux is by no means their only problem either; their attempts at domination of the handheld and PDA markets are struggling, the mobile phone manufacturers are proving very awkward, sales of desktop systems (and hence software) are flat, NT penetration has levelled off and the press seem to sense a wounded giant. The news is not good. The company is seen by some to be structurally unstable.<query> what is microsoft's problem with linux</query>"

I'm surprised that we have never had this discussion here. Personally, I have no idea what I have. I think it is Linux. Nothing in the admin panel of my hosting account says anything about Windows. But, I don't know the difference between the 2 or which is preferred and I know some of you have knowledge of servers and hosting, so what is the difference between the 2? What should I be steering clients towards when they are setting up their first hosting account?

It's really about IIS vs. Apache (and/or NGINX, etc) more than the OS though. If you can use .htaccess in your hosted accounts you're using apache or something that is emulating it. The standard stack is really LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP).

Its cheaper. Also, most open source applications such as wordpress are php which implies Linux / Apache. Probably the most compelling reasons for windows is if there is an application you want to use that is windows based or you have a programmer that knows windows. Or if you were unlucky enough to inherit a windows web site. There have been tons of posts on this on the web. The ""real"" programmers seem to concur that you can do the same things in either system. Its just a matter of practicality. Its cheaper and you have more resources for programming and development with Linux.

If you use things like .asp, ,.net, mssql, and other Microsoft technologies then you'll probably find a Windows server easier and better to use. If you tend toward the .php, mysql, open source side of things then Linux is probably the better way to go. I've had to work with Windows servers here and there using php and mysql and while the Windows server could run the site it made some things more difficult, particularly redirection as there's no .htaccess file. You could still set up redirection, but it was more difficult and wasn't capable of the same things .htaccess was. Given the technologies you work with I would think you'd want Linux every time. Again not to say Linux is automatically the better server. I think it's more to do with the technologies you work with that will lead your preference.<query> which is better linux or windows</query> l Search Engine Friendly Web Design | Van SEO Design l Tips On Marketing, SEO, Design, and Development | TheVanBlog l Custom WordPress Themes Reply With Quote + Reply to Thread « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Bookmarks Bookmarks Digg del.icio.us StumbleUpon Google Facebook Posting Permissions You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Trackbacks are On Pingbacks are On Refbacks are On Forum Rules Contact Us Small-Business-Forum.net Archive Top All times are GMT +1.

Published On :26 July,2010 If you will talk about developing a website with anyone, apart from gathering information about the type of website you need, an important (mandatory) question will come – “do you have any preference for the technology to be used for deploying this website?” Most of the time answer is a question back “What do you suggest?”, reason being clients are not tech savvy so they really do not understand this question.<query> what platform is linux</query> And it’s logical too, if I am associated with implementing the technology I can better understand this question and directly say .NET or PHP as the answer, but if I am a cloth merchant looking for a website this question will sound like Greek to me. Now here the service provider takes the advantage that they suggest the technology in which they expertise, rather it should be decided depending upon the nature of the application to be deployed, scope of the future enhancements and to an extent the budget the client has allotted for the same. While talking about deploying web based applications Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms. Now depending upon the platform of the server on which the site is to be hosted defines the options of the scripting languages and the database servers that can be used for developing the application. If we talk about Linux as the platform the most commonly used scripting languages includes – PHP, CGI, Perl, Python etc.<query> what is the most popular scripting language</query> For Windows platform the scripting languages used are ASP, ASP.NET, C#, Cold Fusion etc. For the database servers Linux offers support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase etc and MS SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle are the database servers of choice for Windows platform. Its not mandatory that these are the categorizations for the scripting languages and database servers for the said platforms, the scripting languages for Linux also come for as Windows binary and visa versa. Though there are certain differences among these two as listed below, but both of them are platforms of choice for deploying functionality rich web based applications: - - Linux is an open source freeware whereas Windows is a Microsoft brand. - Additional components for Linux are generally free whereas the components for Windows need to be purchased. - Linux is considered to be more virus proof then Windows - Web space for Linux being freeware is less costly then Windows - The cost of Linux web space includes the cost for database server whereas for windows if MS SQL server is opted it costs additional.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux</query> For the purposes of listing factors to choose which platform, we can say: - - The budget the client has for hosting. - If the specific requirement requires a specific component then identifying weather it is available with Windows or Linux - If the size of database is going to be huge MS SQL sever is preferred because of the additional features it offers for the data management. - Both Linux and Windows are equally reliable and robust, but yes on Windows special software are required for providing safety from hackers and non-authentic access. - Is the client specific about brand then Windows is the only choice. Thus to conclude, both these platform are platforms of choice for deploying feature rich websites and offer flexibilities of deploying interactive and data rich websites.

Hosting Blog Hosting Articles Hosting Guide Tutorials Sunday March 11, 2012 Top Web Hosting Shared Web Hosting VPS Hosting Dedicated Hosting Reseller Hosting Windows or Linux web hosting platform? When it comes to choosing a platform or operating system, the choice that most people will face is between Linux/UNIX and Windows. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, its followers and its detractors. In this article, we'll list some of the main benefits of each platform, to help you make the choice that's right for you. Tips on how to choose between windows and linux hosting 1. Linux has a reputation for being more reliable than Windows. However, the new generation of Windows platforms (NT4.0 onwards) are generally considered to be nearly as reliable as UNIX. Reliability is probably only an issue if you're a developer. For the average user, there's nothing to choose between the two systems.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux hosting</query> 2. Similarly, there is nothing to choose between Windows and Linux when it comes to performance. Both perform hosting and operating functions to the same standard. 3. Professional web developers tend to prefer UNIX in terms of accessibility. Again, for the average user, both systems are equally user friendly, with simple to use control panels and interfaces. 4. UNIX is open source, and therefore more flexible than Windows, which is a commercial, proprietary product. UNIX can work across any number of operating systems, whereas Windows is pretty much confined to its own products. 5. UNIX also has a reputation for greater stability than Windows. This might be a decisive factor if you're a professional developer, or if your work requires a stable environment generally. 6. Linux is the gamer's platform of choice, since it allows the game to run smoothly and reliably. It can even be used to run games that have been created for Windows (although the reverse isn't necessarily the case). Many commercial games, such as Playstation 3, come with Linux ready installed. 7. Windows is a commercial product, and as such, it needs to take account of its customers' opinions and requirements. The support you get from Windows is generally considered to be better and faster.<query> what is the difference between windows and unix</query> 8. Perhaps the final deciding factor is that of cost. Linux is open source, and therefore free. It's always going to be cheaper than Windows, which, when all is said and done, is there to make money for Microsoft. In the end, the difference between Linux and Windows is very small. Unless you're a heavy user or a professional, you're unlikely to notice it. Your choice may well come down to personal taste, rather than technical considerations. Try both, and see which one feels right for you.

The really top institutions cannot be bought that way; for example Harvard's endowment is valued at $32 billion. It does help to have a parent who went to that college, especially if they are either unusually successful or consistently active in the alumni association. For everyone else the matter is straightforward: make certain there is no weak spot in your application (grades all B and above, etc.) and have something in your favor that 10,000 valedictorians don't have. A state championship in something usually does it. There are many other possibilities; pursue an interest with enough seriousness and depth to produce results.

One of the classes I took at Yale was so incredibly formative that it changed my career goal and got me hooked on philosophies of law I never would have encountered otherwise.

College applications are kind of an exercise in BS-ology. You have to groom this phony image of being well-rounded, interested in everything, nice enough to volunteer for ""good"" causes, etc. It's all BS. Fortunately, once you get to grad school, at least in science and engineering, all that fluff becomes irrelevant. In some European countries, the way you make it into the most prestigious universities is by taking an entrance exam. Everyone gets a grade and a rank based on it (no names show). Then they go down the list until all spots are filled.

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world.<query> what is the benefit of telecommunications technology</query> As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.
