Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

""hdc1""--third IDE hard drive, first partition, etc. SCSI drives have analogous names but start with the letters ""sd"" (=""SCSI drive""), followed by the letter indicating the SCSI interface and by the number indicating the SCSI device id. For example, ""sda4"" means ""first SCSI interface, id number 4"".<query> what is the hda1</query> If you have an external zip drive attached to your parallel port, it will appear as SCSI device ""sda4"" (zip drives work in a SCSI-emulation mode). The listing of partitions that your Linux setup program presents to you during installation will include any MS Windows partitions which you have. For example, I have the following MS Windows partition: mount point type size comment [no mount] vfat 1200 MB [""Win C drive, hda1] /mnt/dos_hdd2 vfat 1600 MB [""Win D drive, hdd2] Don't erase these MS Windows partitions during your Linux installation if you want a dual boot. If you erase the MS Windows partition, MS Windows is gone from your system! If not sure, backup your data from your MS Windows partitions before Linux installation. ""msdos"", ""fat"" and ""vfat"" and ""ntfs"" are typical filesystems used by DOS and MS Windows 3.x/95/98/NT.<query> what is linux partition</query> As a quick reference, here is a brief summary of the standard linux partition types (""filesystems"") with a short description. I copied the info from the linux manual pages:man fs and man mount (with some additions after I had a look at the source code files at /usr/src/linux/fs). The underlined filesystems are the ones that you are more likely to use. Other filesystems (not listed below) are available as add-ons (for example journaling filesystems, compressed, encrypted, ...). minix is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks. ext is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.<query> what is the filesystem for linux</query> It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (ext2) and will eventually be removed from the kernel. ext2 is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the filesystems supported under Linux. In short, ext2 is the main (default, typical) Linux filesystem. ext3 is an extension of the ext2 filesystem with journaling. It is backwards and forward compatibile with ext2. It means that ext2 can be converted into ext3 without reformatting or data loss (just re-mounting the partion is required). ext3 can be changed back to ext2, also without data loss. I use ext3 extensively since Oct.2001--it is simple and trouble-free.<query> what is ext3</query> It is included as an installation ""option"" since RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. It is highly recommended that you use this filesystem. xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The xia filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is used infrequently. msdos is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8 characters followed by an optional period and 3 character extension. umsdos is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS. vfat is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.<query> what is msdos</query> VFAT adds capability for long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem. proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take up disk space. Seeman 5 proc. iso9660 is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard. Two extensions (listed below) are automatically supported. High Sierra --Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. Rock Ridge --Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.<query> what is iso9660</query> It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation. sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS. nfs is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers. smb is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by MS Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs. [Standard linux command ""smbmount"" will also do.] ncpfs is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.<query> what is linux smb</query> devpts--is a pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/ . fat --is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems. UFS --is a file system widely used in different operating systems. swap--is a special partition type used for swapping data from memory to hard drive. raiserfs--is a brand new journaling filesystem available as standard with Linux kernel version 2.4.1 up (January 2001). hfs (=hierarchical files system)--MacIntosh filesystem.

Linux Applications • 7. Learn Linux Commands • A. How to Upgrade Kernel? Before Linux installation, you might really want to know what a hard drive partition is. The concern is that you delete your MS Windows partition when you really don't want to--you want two separate partitions to dual boot. This means: MS Windows is on one partition, Linux is on a separate partition. You do not normally install Linux on free space on your MS Windows-allocated partition(s). It is possible to install Linux on a MS Windows partition, but we do not recommend it. If you plan a dual boot (Linux and MS Windows on the same computer), first use your DOS/Win utilityFDISK to make the MS Windows partition(s).<query> what is the partition for linux</query> Leave part of the hard drive(s) unpartitioned for Linux. You will make and format the Linux partitions during your RedHat (or Mandrake or whatever else) installation. Linux will recognize the free space on the harddrive. Make the MS Windows partition ""primary"" and ""bootable"". Install, configure, and test your MS Windows before Linux installation. If you plan to run Linux only, you need just a clean hard drive (no partitions) to start with. It is possible to have only one Linux partition (plus one for MS Windows if you dual-boot). But it is better to have more partitions so that you can keep users' data separate from the rest of the operating system. This way, if something ever goes wrong, or if you have to reformat or re-install the operating system, you don't lose the users' data.<query> how to install linux on a hard drive</query> (You can perform a complete Linux re-install without losing the contents of the /home directory that contains all user data if you skip the ""re-format"" option given to you during installation. But for that, the /home directory must be on its own partition.) During the Linux setup, you will be asked to partition the available space on your hard drive(s). There are many possible ways to partition, depending on your hard drive space, requirements, and taste. I like Linux hard drive partitions like this (for a modest total of 2 GB of hardrive space which I give to Linux in this example): mount point type size / ext2 300 MB /usr ext2 1200 MB /home ext2 380 MB swap swap 120 MB In the above example, I dedicate 300 MB for the root partition that holds the base of the Linux operating system.<query> how much space does linux need</query> I allocate 1200 MB to the mount point that will be visible on my filesystem as the/usr directory and will contain the user's programs (the programs that don't come with the base operating system and I install later, for example StarOffice). I dedicate 380 MB for the partition that will be visible as the directory/home and will contain the setting and data of all users on the machine. And I allocate 120 MB to a ""raw"" partition for the operating system to use as the virtual memory (extension of the physical, silicon memory on the hard drive, so-called swap). If your kernel is lower than 2.2 (this is the case with standard RH5.2 and earlier), your swap partition cannot be larger than approximately 127 MB. The rule of thumb is that the swap should be about twice the amount of the physical memory (RAM).<query> what is the size of a swap partition</query> If you need more (e.g. if you have lots of physical memory, or you expect to run custom programs with really large data structures) you might want to create a larger swap partition during the installation (or several smaller swap partitions) or add a swap file(s) later. 2 GB is a respectible amount of disk space and should be sufficient for users who like having many applications. (This is because Linux applications tend to be slimmer than their MS Windows equivalents). However, if you try to install everything that's available on the modern distribution CDs, you will surely run out of disk space. My experience is that however large the hard drive space, it will get filled and I regret I don't have more :-) . If my space on the hard drive is really restricted, I may consider a two-partition setup like this (for a lean 650 MB total dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 600 MB swap swap 50 MB<query> how much space do i need for linux</query> In this example, I dedicate 600 MB to the base of the operating system, applications, and user documents/data, and allow 50 MB for the swap partition (for the operating system to use as the virtual memory). The 50-MB swap should be quite sufficient for medium duty operations. The limitation of 600 MB for the operating system, applications and user data means that you will have to be very selective as to which applications you install or else you risk running out of hard drive space. Try pressing when installing the optional software that comes on the Red Hat CD--it will give you a short description of what the software does so you could perhaps decide if you really need it. (Don't worry too much if you miss something you need, you can install the missing parts later).<query> how much space does a redhat cd need</query> You can easily finish the RedHat installation with 200 MB free on your Linux partition (out of 600 MB used in this example) if you make reasonable choices. Please note that ""bundling together"" the root partition ""/"" and the /home directory will likely save you some disk space, but it is not the safest solution. It is possible to install Linux on even less disk space than in the example above, but you will have to be really picky as to what you install. For a larger available hard drive space, I may consider the following setup (for a comfortable total of 15 GB dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 800 MB /usr ext2 5000 MB /usr/local ext2 3000 MB /home ext2 5200 MB swap swap 1000 MB Please note that the the mount points can reside on different physical hard drives.<query> how much space do i need to install linux</query> Linux agglomarates all the hard drive space into a single directory tree. Another consideration when setting up the partitions on older computers (486?). Many older BIOSes have the restriction that the boot partition cannot extend beyond the 1024th cylinder on your first physical hard drive. To overcome this limitation, simply make the first (bootable) partition so that it ends before the cylinder number 1023 (this makes this partition max approximately 512 MB in size, which is plenty for the ""/"" root partition). Once Linux boots, the BIOS restriction does not matter any more because Linux takes over the hardware management and it can access the partition(s) beyond the cylinder number 1023. When installing and using Linux, your drives appear as devices with the following names: hda--first IDE drive (stands for ""hard drive a"", i.e. the master drive on the first IDE interface), hdb--second IDE drive (i.e., the slave drive on the first IDE interface), hdc--third IDE drive (i.e. the master drive on the second IDE interface), hdd--fourth IDE drive (i.e. the slave drive on the second IDE interface).<query> what is the partition number for linux</query>"

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree. I would like to take flying lessons but as I am stationed in England (not to mention my newborn baby), it's seemingly impossible right now.<query> what is the scope of a plane</query> Well that's enough about me. Basically I just have these few questions: 1. What education level is required, or preferred, to fly the ""big iron""? 2. Do most pilots start out flying small props to gain flying hours, or do some airlines offer a training program to start you out on jetliners? 3. As I am 27 now, does that somewhat hamper me because of my late start? 4. Do you have just any general tips for me to follow to achieve my newfound dream of becoming and airline pilot? Nash Hi Nash, 1. To be a pilot, a degree is preferable but not an absolute requirement. It depends on the Airlines. The Cadet Pilot or Airline Sponsorship Program is very competitive and usually the cream is selected.<query> what is the education level to become an airline pilot</query> For instance, in one recent advert for sponsorship in UK (they have stopped this program today), there were 40,000 applications for the 100 positions available. However, not all is lost if you do not meet the stringent entry requirements. In your case, are you able to change your trade to become an Air Force pilot to gain some flying experience? Most flying jobs in the military would require a college degree although there are a few exceptions. Your military flying hours are usually recognized in civil aviation. Once you have accumulated sufficient flying hours in the Air Force, enroll yourself into a Commercial Pilot's License course first. When your term with the Air Force expires, you would most likely be ready to seek employment in the civil sector as a co pilot in a multiengine transport airplane. You will have to work your way from the bottom of the ladder but you will not regret for you will learn a lot on the right hand seat.<query> how to become an air force pilot</query> Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License. Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer it take. jawed nasim , 14 Jun, 2010 +0 is becoming a pilot a big problem...? not at all....!!! hi friends, now its very easy to become pilot.. become a pilot with 200 hrs flying exp.

The second thing to do is to take a trial lesson to see if you really like that environment and you feel comfortable doing this as a career, i.e. you if you want to become a pilot. Of course if you are young, then talking to the family will help, and getting their support will be important for your flying career. Also, try to learn as much as much as possible about flying and aircrafts. Learning to fly is an expensive business unless you are luck enough to be chosen for the air force to be trained as a military pilot or get selected for one of the very few airline sponsorship programs. So knowing what to expect in becoming a pilot is very important to reduce the flying training costs.

Its stock touched $600 on Thursday, which represents $560 billion in market capitalization. Compare this to Exxon Mobil, with a market cap of $400 billion, IBM's $240 billion and Wal-Mart's $210 billion. Can Apple really be worth that much? The easy answer is that the company is worth whatever the market says it's worth. Well, yes, the market is right every day—but it is right only for that day. What about tomorrow?

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority. Further proposals include transformation to a Social Enterprise. These proposals provide the opportunity for future community health services to be provided through Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) ensuring better partnership working with different organisations developing healthcare services together. All Primary Care Trusts including NHS Northamptonshire will complete the transformation by April 2011.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results. Not all hospitals are able to provide this level of care or see enough patients, so it's worth travelling further to a hospital that can. It has not yet been decided where in the East Midlands these Specialist Centres will be. Each hospital has been asked if they are able to offer a specialist 24/7 service and we are talking to patients and health professionals before we make any decisions. As part of the commitment to seeking public opinion we're inviting the public to a NHS East Midlands-led workshop, where we will give an overview of the current system and outline our initial thoughts on what a new system would look like.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Incandescent Lightbulbs Are Banned! Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. By admin on January 8, 2012 in Bans, Big Government, Canada, Europe, Government Control, Green, United States Image via Wikipedia It is now 2012, and the ban on incandescents in the United States has started. Many other countries have their own bans either already in place or planned. Canada was planned to start in 2012, but has delayed the ban due to environmental concerns over the disposal of compact fluorescents (CFLs).<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> Environmental protection is much easier to control at the utility level rather than at the personal level. Thus, your personal exposure is much smaller. Getting around the ban Image via Wikipedia As far as I know, it is not illegal to actually own Â incandescent lighting. It may be more difficult to obtain the bulbs, but once you have them, you can use them. In countries such as Germany,Â incandescents are now sold as “heat lamps”. You just have to love the ingenuity of entrepreneurs in serving legitimate consumer choice. They are even donating part of the proceeds to saving the forests, for the environmentally inclined. Americans, if you want to buy incandescents, then Canada could be an option for you! Just be aware that it is still illegal to import these bulbs into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs this year.<query> are incandescent lights illegal</query> Yes, light bulbs now belong to the same category as illegal drugs and weapons! What a sad world that this has come to.Â When did we allow the government this degree of control over our lives? My personal thoughts on the ban I can’t believe they would actually ban this icon of history. TheÂ incandescent bulbÂ is an example of ingenuity and progress, and has always been used to represent bright ideas. Should we start drawing CFLs over people’s heads in comic strips? The arguments against the bulb is that it is inefficient, but this is a subjective opinion. If you live in a country like Canada where it is cold most of the year, the heat emitted by these bulbs is no waste at all. At the same time, the quality of light is also a subjective factor. Should we start banning high-end nVidia graphics cards and 2000 watt baseboard heaters because they, too, consume “a lot” of energy?<query> why do light bulbs need to be banned</query> Why not force everyone to keep their home temperatures to a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius in the winter? Surely anything more is “wasteful”, and people can always toss on an extra sweater. I am not against avoiding waste and protecting the environment. I turn down my heat in the winter and I take public transportation. I close lights when I am not in the room, and I drive a 4 banger on the weekends. I am willing to bet that I consume far less energy than the typical home. If there is a problem with energy usage and pollution, then the proper scope to address that is at the utility level. Banning incandescents does not address the problem; it only makes a scapegoat out of a perfectly legitimate consumer good and harms consumer choice. What happened to consumer choice? Image via Wikipedia I have nothing against others purchasing and using CFLs, so long as they dispose of them properly, but I believe that it is a personal choice that should be made by each consumer, and not imposed top-down by the government.<query> what is the limit on incandescent lights</query> Incandescent light bulbs do use energy, but so do 1000 other things like electric baseboard heaters, coffee makers, and computers.Â Only the consumer is best equipped to make the decisions with her money that best apply to her situation. I have used and still use CFLs, but the light quality makes me physically ill. I will only use them for garage and patio lights and things like that, where I can decide for myself that they have utility. For everywhere else, I prefer incandescents, and maybe in the future I’ll give LEDs a try, if they also have a healthy color spectrum. That is my choice.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Forest January 8, 2012 at 2:54 pm # I don’t know if I would call them a ‘perfectly legitimate consumer good’ because there are a lot of faults in them.<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> That being said it does not mean the energy savers are much better environmentally and in other ways (yes often the light from them is terrible but they are getting better). Long term the ‘legal’ bulbs are cheaper, in my experience, so from that aspect it could be a good move and it could help lower the USA’s energy output…. We’ll have to see the data after a few years. I’d be surprised if during the winter the heat from the bulbs significantly lowered heating bills so I am not sure that argument flies, again the data needs to be crunched somewhere. Ad for the ban, it is kind of silly. A possible better option would have been a tax on the bulbs which was used to bring down the cost of the energy savers but I know you are already cringing at that idea!!!!<query> why are light bulbs banned</query> Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 3:03 pm # Hey Forest, I am glad that we both believe that a ban is completely silly! There are faults in everything, but I call them a “perfectly legitimate consumer good” because on a voluntary free market, many people would still prefer to buy them. People weigh the faults and trade-offs in different consumer goods, and choose what makes the most sense. I do not have hard data on how much I save in heating from incandescents, but I can feel the heat being given off and I am sure that most of that heat is not simply being “wasted”, as is often implied. I think that LEDs can become a real viable alternative down the road. They have long lifespans, and they are capable of accurate color spectrum reproduction.<query> why are led lights considered legitimate</query> Perhaps not as smooth as incandescents, but far superior to fluorescents, and without the ultraviolet and mercury problems of fluorescents. There are very legitimate health reasons for choosing incandescents over CFLs, and there are perfectly legitimate subjective reasons as well. Who is anyone else to tell me that I am “wrong” for preferring incandescents? Likewise, others can buy CFLs, but I still think that they should dispose of them properly. Thanks for the great comment! Reply Forest January 8, 2012 at 3:19 pm # Of course, I completely forgot about LED lights, we have had that conversation before. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:26 pm # I’ll have a follow-up post soon on why CFLs suck, but LEDs can be a great viable option. Reply Darwin's Money January 8, 2012 at 4:49 pm # I’ve always liked seeing the free market dictate consumer behavior and force anachronistic technologies out of business.<query> why do people prefer incandescent lights over led lights</query> I don’t feel the benefits of newer bulbs are compelling enough to basically “outlaw” production and sale of incandescents. But, it probably scored points with the green movement. So, I guess we’re all relegated to higher cost bulbs with theoretical life-spans that we hope will pan out financially. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:25 pm # Great comment, Darwin. This is a clear example where the arguments for a ban just don’t pass muster. Even if CFLs are more “efficient” on a lumens-output model, that certainly doesn’t account for the differences in quality of lighting nor many other factors. The beauty of a voluntary free market is that it CAN account for all of these factors, perhaps not perfectly, but in a way that much more closely reaches what customers actually want. Reply 101 Centavos January 8, 2012 at 5:11 pm # Just bought a few more boxes of incandescent bulbs today.<query> why do we ban incandescent bulbs</query> I suppose that makes me a hoarder, but I need the heat output to keep the water pipes from freezing in the well house. I remember as a kid playing around with mercury globules, when thermometers would break. Who knew…? Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:32 pm # Hah! Well, you didn’t seem to suffer for it! I’m gonna be stocking up on more incandescents too, while I can. Apparently the Czech President recommended stockpiling enough to last a lifetime. That might be a bit excessive, but I will wait until LEDs or something better becomes affordable. I have no interest in joining the CFL bandwagon; I’ve been there and I didn’t enjoy it. Reply Moneycone January 8, 2012 at 7:16 pm # Nice coverage FG! A number of cities were early adopters of LED bulbs for the traffic lights.<query> why do we need more led lights</query> What are the phase-out plans like all over the world? Canada Canada has decided toÂ back downÂ from its plan to ban incandescents in 2012. The reasons cited are that there is a disposal problem with CFLs due to the mercury content, which poses an environmental hazard. The ban is still planned for 2014, so if you want to stock up on incandescents, then now is the time. China China will begin to phase out incandescent light bulbs beginning this October, and will continue to progressively ban lower and lower-wattage bulbs as time goes on. The ban will be complete by 2016. European Union The phasing-out of incandescent bulbs in the European Union is scheduled to be completed this year. United Kingdom Most incandescent bulbs are already banned in the UK; the venerable 40w will also suffer its demise this year.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned in the us</query> When it came out each bulb cost something like $400 as opposed to incandescents which were 1/10th the price! This was fine till winter struck! See, with incandescents, the heat side effect kept these lights clear from snow build-ups, but no such luck with LEDs, which ran much cooler! I found this a fascinating adverse effect of modern technology! (And hey, thanks for the mention!) Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 8:52 pm # Oh yeah at least half of the traffic lights around here use LEDs now. I think that is an application that makes a lot of sense! No snow problems because I guess the fixture itself is designed to prevent that problem (I live in Canada where we get a lot of snow ).

Yes, I too live in Canada and LED’s aren’t all they are cracked up to be for our climate. There is something to be said for the heat output of incandescents.

I can’t remember the last time I thought “The room’s cold – quick, turn on a light.” Yes, I’m being silly and perhaps it’s because I just posted on energy-wise ways to keep *cool* this summer. We replaced all the lights in our apartment with CFLs a while ago and I certainly haven’t seen a problem. Dispose of them as you would a mercury thermometer. Many of us still have those in our homes and they contain far, far more mercury (1/2 gram) than a CFL bulb (1-5 mg). It’s not a matter of finding a hazmat suit – open a window for about 15 minutes, sweep the bulb into a secure container and take it to a proper disposal place, somewhere obscure and hard to find like … Home Depot, Ikea, Lowe’s … Personally, I see this as a good change.<query> how to keep cfl bulbs out of your house</query> When I see the Hummers pull into the gas station across the street, or look at the cigarette butts outside our apartment building, I question the wisdom of the consumer when it comes to choosing the better product. Reply admin May 2, 2012 at 8:28 am # I think your comment shows that it’s really a very subjective decision. I, too, replaced all the lights with CFLs, but I switched back as I couldn’t stand the lighting. I think they’re still fine for outdoor lights and other, similar areas. I didn’t even know about the differences in light spectrum and stuff like that, but I learned about that once I did my own research. It really comes down to personal preference. Different things make different people happy. Raw energy efficiency is a poor determinant of consumer utility, as different things use different amounts of energy.<query> can you use cfl lights outside</query> The most energy-efficient lifestyle might be to go life off the land and give up all modern conveniences, but I doubt many people would derive a lot of utility from that. The balancing fulcrum should be a person’s subjective desires, moderated by the avoidance of harming others via externalities. If you think incandescents use too much energy, then the proper, agnostic way is to moderate that based on power consumption and pollution at the utility source. A ban is the wrong way to go about it.

However, the law is still in effect and it is still illegal to manufacture these bulbs or import them into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs. Around the world More information can be found on Wikipedia: Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs. Why is this ban harmful? Why do incandescent bulbs need to be banned?

In addition, if a new product is technologically and subjectively superior, there would be absolutely no need for a ban in order for consumers to switch to the new product. They would switch themselves, by their own willingness to buy something that they judge is better. Everyone has their own personal reasons for preferring one form of lighting over others, but here are some qualitative reasons as to why the consumers need to be forced into buying alternatives, instead of doing it on their own free will: The light quality of CFLs is inferior to incandescent lighting. Incandescent lightbulbs emit a smooth spectrum of light that is very similar to the output of the sun. Both emit “blackbody” radiation, which is smooth across many different frequencies.<query> why do we need to ban lighting</query> This form of lighting is natural and is the type of lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Incandescent lights don’t burn as hot as the sun, and therefore they appear warmer and more yellowish as compared to sunlight. Incandescent lights may seem yellowish during the day, but these same properties also cause the light to be more pleasing to the eye at night, which is when the bulbs would actually be used. The light emitted by many CFLs, on the other hand, is far inferior. Fluorescent lights work by emitting ultraviolet radiation onto a phosphor coating; this coating is then excited and emits colors in the visible spectrum. This is similar to the ways that CRT TVs work. The problem is that this light is emitted in very narrow bands, which results in a rather unnatural form of light: Image via Wikipedia Such a spiky, unnatural spectrum can cause many symptoms, such as headaches, poorer sleep patterns, or a general malaise.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and fluorescent lights</query> This type of lighting is very artificial and not at all like the lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Here is another example: Image via Wikipedia The easiest way to see this pattern is to take out a CD (a type of diffraction grating) and hold it under different types of lighting. You can easily see the jagged spectrum of a fluorescent light with this method. Here were some results obtained by using a diffraction grating: Spectra of different types of bulbs. Source: http://web.ncf.ca/jim/misc/cfl/ As you can see, only the LED comes close to a natural light spectrum, just like the incandescent. The spikes of additional blue and green light emitted by fluorescent lights may also cause problems with sleeping. Humans are sensitive to blue light in the evenings, and additional exposure can disrupt the natural sleep cycle.<query> what kind of light is fluorescent</query> (For those doing a lot of computer work at night: I recommendf.lux.) CFLs are hazardous to personal health and to the environment. Image by lundyd via Flickr Compact fluorescent lights contain mercury, an extremely toxic element that can cause significant neurological damage, especially to those at risk such as the pregnant, or young children. There is little mercury exposure so long as the bulbs are used and disposed of properly, but the problem is that a bulb can break, releasing mercury in the direct vicinity. Very few people actually dispose of these bulbs properly either because local programs don’t exist or it is too cumbersome to do so. That means that mercury can get into the local groundwater or air when disposed of in the trash and later dumped in the landfill or burned in the local incinerator. The mercury content can also be dangerous if a CFL bulb breaks and the dust is spread out over a wide area.<query> are cfls hazardous</query> When an incandescent bulb breaks, all you have to worry about is some sharp glass, but when a CFL bulb breaks, not only do you have to worry about cutting yourself on mercury-laced glass, but you also have to worry about breathing in the dust. Do you really think that people are going to be putting on gas masks and then separating the waste into a special container, which they will then bring to the local hazardous waste disposal center? No way. They will use a vacuum or a broom, spreading the mercury dust everywhere, and they will dump the broken remains of the bulb into the regular trash, where it will go on to potentially contaminate the groundwater. This has actually happened at a friend’s home. The CFL bulb did not have a screw-base, and it wasn’t properly installed.<query> what happens when a cfl bulb breaks</query> It fell out, crashing and spreading fine dust and glass bits everywhere. This friend used a broom and vacuum to sweep up the dust, probably inhaling a lot along the way, and then tossing everything in the regular trash. This is how most people are going to handle CFLs, and they will be exposing themselves and others to mercury along the way. Don’t incandescent lights actually emit more mercury? There is a disingenuous argument that incandescent lights emit more mercury than CFLs, but this is looking solely at the effect of coal power plants. This has absolutely nothing to do with the incandescent lightbulb itself and everything to do with the form of energy generation. In that sense, CFLs would also be contributing to additional mercury pollution beyond what they directly contribute. Even if you live in a jurisdiction where all of your power comes from dirty coal plants, you are probably living far away from the plant, and furthermore these plants have special scrubbers and environmental procedures in place in order to minimize the impact on humans and other wildlife.<query> do incandescent lights emit more mercury</query>"

In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed.

Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods.

Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years. Arch Intern Med. 2007 Mar 12;167(5):490-6.; Eur Heart J. 2006 Mar;27(6):641-3. Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5. Isn't your heart worth protecting, especially when the prescription—a morning bowl of hearty whole grains—is so delicious?

Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women. (Cade JE, Burley VJ, et al. ,International Journal of Epidemiology).<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Pre-menopausal women eating the most fiber (>30 grams daily) more than halved their risk of developing breast cancer, enjoying a 52% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women whose diets supplied the least fiber (<20 grams/day). Fiber supplied by whole grains offered the most protection. Pre-menopausal women eating the most whole grain fiber (at least 13 g/day) had a 41% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest whole grain fiber intake (4 g or less per day). Fiber from fruit was also protective. Pre-menopausal women whose diets supplied the most fiber from fruit (at least 6 g/day) had a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest fruit fiber intake (2 g or less per day).<query> what is the best fiber for premenopausal women</query>"

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p.
