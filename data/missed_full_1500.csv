Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority. Further proposals include transformation to a Social Enterprise. These proposals provide the opportunity for future community health services to be provided through Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) ensuring better partnership working with different organisations developing healthcare services together.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results. Not all hospitals are able to provide this level of care or see enough patients, so it's worth travelling further to a hospital that can.

By admin on January 8, 2012 in Bans, Big Government, Canada, Europe, Government Control, Green, United States Image via Wikipedia It is now 2012, and the ban on incandescents in the United States has started. Many other countries have their own bans either already in place or planned. Canada was planned to start in 2012, but has delayed the ban due to environmental concerns over the disposal of compact fluorescents (CFLs).<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> Environmental protection is much easier to control at the utility level rather than at the personal level. Thus, your personal exposure is much smaller. Getting around the ban Image via Wikipedia As far as I know, it is not illegal to actually own Â incandescent lighting. It may be more difficult to obtain the bulbs, but once you have them, you can use them. In countries such as Germany,Â incandescents are now sold as “heat lamps”. You just have to love the ingenuity of entrepreneurs in serving legitimate consumer choice. They are even donating part of the proceeds to saving the forests, for the environmentally inclined. Americans, if you want to buy incandescents, then Canada could be an option for you! Just be aware that it is still illegal to import these bulbs into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs this year.<query> are incandescent lights illegal</query> Yes, light bulbs now belong to the same category as illegal drugs and weapons! What a sad world that this has come to.Â When did we allow the government this degree of control over our lives? My personal thoughts on the ban I can’t believe they would actually ban this icon of history. TheÂ incandescent bulbÂ is an example of ingenuity and progress, and has always been used to represent bright ideas. Should we start drawing CFLs over people’s heads in comic strips? The arguments against the bulb is that it is inefficient, but this is a subjective opinion. If you live in a country like Canada where it is cold most of the year, the heat emitted by these bulbs is no waste at all. At the same time, the quality of light is also a subjective factor. Should we start banning high-end nVidia graphics cards and 2000 watt baseboard heaters because they, too, consume “a lot” of energy?<query> why do light bulbs need to be banned</query> Why not force everyone to keep their home temperatures to a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius in the winter? Surely anything more is “wasteful”, and people can always toss on an extra sweater. I am not against avoiding waste and protecting the environment. I turn down my heat in the winter and I take public transportation. I close lights when I am not in the room, and I drive a 4 banger on the weekends. I am willing to bet that I consume far less energy than the typical home. If there is a problem with energy usage and pollution, then the proper scope to address that is at the utility level. Banning incandescents does not address the problem; it only makes a scapegoat out of a perfectly legitimate consumer good and harms consumer choice. What happened to consumer choice? Image via Wikipedia I have nothing against others purchasing and using CFLs, so long as they dispose of them properly, but I believe that it is a personal choice that should be made by each consumer, and not imposed top-down by the government.<query> what is the limit on incandescent lights</query> Incandescent light bulbs do use energy, but so do 1000 other things like electric baseboard heaters, coffee makers, and computers.Â Only the consumer is best equipped to make the decisions with her money that best apply to her situation. I have used and still use CFLs, but the light quality makes me physically ill. I will only use them for garage and patio lights and things like that, where I can decide for myself that they have utility. For everywhere else, I prefer incandescents, and maybe in the future I’ll give LEDs a try, if they also have a healthy color spectrum. That is my choice.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Forest January 8, 2012 at 2:54 pm # I don’t know if I would call them a ‘perfectly legitimate consumer good’ because there are a lot of faults in them.<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> That being said it does not mean the energy savers are much better environmentally and in other ways (yes often the light from them is terrible but they are getting better). Long term the ‘legal’ bulbs are cheaper, in my experience, so from that aspect it could be a good move and it could help lower the USA’s energy output…. We’ll have to see the data after a few years. I’d be surprised if during the winter the heat from the bulbs significantly lowered heating bills so I am not sure that argument flies, again the data needs to be crunched somewhere. Ad for the ban, it is kind of silly. A possible better option would have been a tax on the bulbs which was used to bring down the cost of the energy savers but I know you are already cringing at that idea!!!!<query> why are light bulbs banned</query> Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 3:03 pm # Hey Forest, I am glad that we both believe that a ban is completely silly! There are faults in everything, but I call them a “perfectly legitimate consumer good” because on a voluntary free market, many people would still prefer to buy them. People weigh the faults and trade-offs in different consumer goods, and choose what makes the most sense. I do not have hard data on how much I save in heating from incandescents, but I can feel the heat being given off and I am sure that most of that heat is not simply being “wasted”, as is often implied. I think that LEDs can become a real viable alternative down the road. They have long lifespans, and they are capable of accurate color spectrum reproduction.<query> why are led lights considered legitimate</query> Perhaps not as smooth as incandescents, but far superior to fluorescents, and without the ultraviolet and mercury problems of fluorescents. There are very legitimate health reasons for choosing incandescents over CFLs, and there are perfectly legitimate subjective reasons as well. Who is anyone else to tell me that I am “wrong” for preferring incandescents? Likewise, others can buy CFLs, but I still think that they should dispose of them properly. Thanks for the great comment! Reply Forest January 8, 2012 at 3:19 pm # Of course, I completely forgot about LED lights, we have had that conversation before. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:26 pm # I’ll have a follow-up post soon on why CFLs suck, but LEDs can be a great viable option. Reply Darwin's Money January 8, 2012 at 4:49 pm # I’ve always liked seeing the free market dictate consumer behavior and force anachronistic technologies out of business.<query> why do people prefer incandescent lights over led lights</query> I don’t feel the benefits of newer bulbs are compelling enough to basically “outlaw” production and sale of incandescents. But, it probably scored points with the green movement. So, I guess we’re all relegated to higher cost bulbs with theoretical life-spans that we hope will pan out financially. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:25 pm # Great comment, Darwin. This is a clear example where the arguments for a ban just don’t pass muster. Even if CFLs are more “efficient” on a lumens-output model, that certainly doesn’t account for the differences in quality of lighting nor many other factors. The beauty of a voluntary free market is that it CAN account for all of these factors, perhaps not perfectly, but in a way that much more closely reaches what customers actually want. Reply 101 Centavos January 8, 2012 at 5:11 pm # Just bought a few more boxes of incandescent bulbs today.<query> why do we ban incandescent bulbs</query> I suppose that makes me a hoarder, but I need the heat output to keep the water pipes from freezing in the well house. I remember as a kid playing around with mercury globules, when thermometers would break. Who knew…? Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:32 pm # Hah! Well, you didn’t seem to suffer for it! I’m gonna be stocking up on more incandescents too, while I can. Apparently the Czech President recommended stockpiling enough to last a lifetime. That might be a bit excessive, but I will wait until LEDs or something better becomes affordable. I have no interest in joining the CFL bandwagon; I’ve been there and I didn’t enjoy it. Reply Moneycone January 8, 2012 at 7:16 pm # Nice coverage FG! A number of cities were early adopters of LED bulbs for the traffic lights.<query> why do we need more led lights</query> What are the phase-out plans like all over the world? Canada Canada has decided toÂ back downÂ from its plan to ban incandescents in 2012. The reasons cited are that there is a disposal problem with CFLs due to the mercury content, which poses an environmental hazard. The ban is still planned for 2014, so if you want to stock up on incandescents, then now is the time. China China will begin to phase out incandescent light bulbs beginning this October, and will continue to progressively ban lower and lower-wattage bulbs as time goes on. The ban will be complete by 2016. European Union The phasing-out of incandescent bulbs in the European Union is scheduled to be completed this year. United Kingdom Most incandescent bulbs are already banned in the UK; the venerable 40w will also suffer its demise this year.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned in the us</query> When it came out each bulb cost something like $400 as opposed to incandescents which were 1/10th the price! This was fine till winter struck! See, with incandescents, the heat side effect kept these lights clear from snow build-ups, but no such luck with LEDs, which ran much cooler! I found this a fascinating adverse effect of modern technology! (And hey, thanks for the mention!) Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 8:52 pm # Oh yeah at least half of the traffic lights around here use LEDs now. I think that is an application that makes a lot of sense! No snow problems because I guess the fixture itself is designed to prevent that problem (I live in Canada where we get a lot of snow ).

Reply Miss T @ Prairie Eco-Thrifter January 9, 2012 at 3:16 pm # New technology isn’t always the answer. I am all for being green but we have to do it smartly. Yes, I too live in Canada and LED’s aren’t all they are cracked up to be for our climate. There is something to be said for the heat output of incandescents. Plus, like you say, what are we going to do with all of the bulbs that are still working right?<query> where are you buying led bulbs</query> Throwing them away is just plain wasteful. I am all for improvements but lets be smart about this. Reply admin January 9, 2012 at 9:41 pm # Completely agreed! That is why I really think it should come down to consumer choice, and a system of laws and rules that discourages pollution and imposing costs on others. Unfortunately these debates often become too politicized. Reply youngandthrifty January 10, 2012 at 12:08 am # Ughh I feel sick- I have a broken CFL bulb sitting on my back porch.

Reply Roshawn @ Watson Inc January 10, 2012 at 8:39 am # You know, I am not necessarily for the ban either. I agree that if a product is superior (& is appropriately marketed), then why do they need to ban the other products to get consumers to switch. That’s a great point. I chuckled when you mentioned that in Germany, they are now marketed as “heat lamps.” I guess entrepreneurs are employing whatever will work.

More info here:Illegal Light Bulbs Thanks, Frank Reply Karin @ HR Degree Directory April 22, 2012 at 10:05 pm # My opinion is leave it to the consumers, whether they want to patronize incandescent bulbs or not. Pursuing the ban has two directions: bankrupting the entrepreneurs and cleaning the environment. The choice is yours. Reply admin April 26, 2012 at 9:50 am # Not so much cleaning the environment with that mercury content.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned</query> It should be down to the consumers, I agree. Reply Canadian Doomer April 29, 2012 at 12:10 pm # I’m laughing at the idea of the heat from incandescent lights being welcome in icy cold Canada. I can’t remember the last time I thought “The room’s cold – quick, turn on a light.” Yes, I’m being silly and perhaps it’s because I just posted on energy-wise ways to keep *cool* this summer. We replaced all the lights in our apartment with CFLs a while ago and I certainly haven’t seen a problem. Dispose of them as you would a mercury thermometer. Many of us still have those in our homes and they contain far, far more mercury (1/2 gram) than a CFL bulb (1-5 mg). It’s not a matter of finding a hazmat suit – open a window for about 15 minutes, sweep the bulb into a secure container and take it to a proper disposal place, somewhere obscure and hard to find like … Home Depot, Ikea, Lowe’s … Personally, I see this as a good change.<query> how to keep cfl bulbs out of your house</query> When I see the Hummers pull into the gas station across the street, or look at the cigarette butts outside our apartment building, I question the wisdom of the consumer when it comes to choosing the better product. Reply admin May 2, 2012 at 8:28 am # I think your comment shows that it’s really a very subjective decision. I, too, replaced all the lights with CFLs, but I switched back as I couldn’t stand the lighting. I think they’re still fine for outdoor lights and other, similar areas. I didn’t even know about the differences in light spectrum and stuff like that, but I learned about that once I did my own research. It really comes down to personal preference. Different things make different people happy. Raw energy efficiency is a poor determinant of consumer utility, as different things use different amounts of energy.<query> can you use cfl lights outside</query> The most energy-efficient lifestyle might be to go life off the land and give up all modern conveniences, but I doubt many people would derive a lot of utility from that. The balancing fulcrum should be a person’s subjective desires, moderated by the avoidance of harming others via externalities. If you think incandescents use too much energy, then the proper, agnostic way is to moderate that based on power consumption and pollution at the utility source. A ban is the wrong way to go about it.

In addition, if a new product is technologically and subjectively superior, there would be absolutely no need for a ban in order for consumers to switch to the new product. They would switch themselves, by their own willingness to buy something that they judge is better. Everyone has their own personal reasons for preferring one form of lighting over others, but here are some qualitative reasons as to why the consumers need to be forced into buying alternatives, instead of doing it on their own free will: The light quality of CFLs is inferior to incandescent lighting. Incandescent lightbulbs emit a smooth spectrum of light that is very similar to the output of the sun. Both emit “blackbody” radiation, which is smooth across many different frequencies.<query> why do we need to ban lighting</query> This form of lighting is natural and is the type of lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Incandescent lights don’t burn as hot as the sun, and therefore they appear warmer and more yellowish as compared to sunlight. Incandescent lights may seem yellowish during the day, but these same properties also cause the light to be more pleasing to the eye at night, which is when the bulbs would actually be used. The light emitted by many CFLs, on the other hand, is far inferior. Fluorescent lights work by emitting ultraviolet radiation onto a phosphor coating; this coating is then excited and emits colors in the visible spectrum. This is similar to the ways that CRT TVs work. The problem is that this light is emitted in very narrow bands, which results in a rather unnatural form of light: Image via Wikipedia Such a spiky, unnatural spectrum can cause many symptoms, such as headaches, poorer sleep patterns, or a general malaise.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and fluorescent lights</query> This type of lighting is very artificial and not at all like the lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Here is another example: Image via Wikipedia The easiest way to see this pattern is to take out a CD (a type of diffraction grating) and hold it under different types of lighting. You can easily see the jagged spectrum of a fluorescent light with this method. Here were some results obtained by using a diffraction grating: Spectra of different types of bulbs. Source: http://web.ncf.ca/jim/misc/cfl/ As you can see, only the LED comes close to a natural light spectrum, just like the incandescent. The spikes of additional blue and green light emitted by fluorescent lights may also cause problems with sleeping. Humans are sensitive to blue light in the evenings, and additional exposure can disrupt the natural sleep cycle.<query> what kind of light is fluorescent</query> (For those doing a lot of computer work at night: I recommendf.lux.) CFLs are hazardous to personal health and to the environment. Image by lundyd via Flickr Compact fluorescent lights contain mercury, an extremely toxic element that can cause significant neurological damage, especially to those at risk such as the pregnant, or young children. There is little mercury exposure so long as the bulbs are used and disposed of properly, but the problem is that a bulb can break, releasing mercury in the direct vicinity. Very few people actually dispose of these bulbs properly either because local programs don’t exist or it is too cumbersome to do so. That means that mercury can get into the local groundwater or air when disposed of in the trash and later dumped in the landfill or burned in the local incinerator. The mercury content can also be dangerous if a CFL bulb breaks and the dust is spread out over a wide area.<query> are cfls hazardous</query> When an incandescent bulb breaks, all you have to worry about is some sharp glass, but when a CFL bulb breaks, not only do you have to worry about cutting yourself on mercury-laced glass, but you also have to worry about breathing in the dust. Do you really think that people are going to be putting on gas masks and then separating the waste into a special container, which they will then bring to the local hazardous waste disposal center? No way. They will use a vacuum or a broom, spreading the mercury dust everywhere, and they will dump the broken remains of the bulb into the regular trash, where it will go on to potentially contaminate the groundwater. This has actually happened at a friend’s home. The CFL bulb did not have a screw-base, and it wasn’t properly installed.<query> what happens when a cfl bulb breaks</query> It fell out, crashing and spreading fine dust and glass bits everywhere. This friend used a broom and vacuum to sweep up the dust, probably inhaling a lot along the way, and then tossing everything in the regular trash. This is how most people are going to handle CFLs, and they will be exposing themselves and others to mercury along the way. Don’t incandescent lights actually emit more mercury? There is a disingenuous argument that incandescent lights emit more mercury than CFLs, but this is looking solely at the effect of coal power plants. This has absolutely nothing to do with the incandescent lightbulb itself and everything to do with the form of energy generation. In that sense, CFLs would also be contributing to additional mercury pollution beyond what they directly contribute. Even if you live in a jurisdiction where all of your power comes from dirty coal plants, you are probably living far away from the plant, and furthermore these plants have special scrubbers and environmental procedures in place in order to minimize the impact on humans and other wildlife.<query> do incandescent lights emit more mercury</query>"

In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed. Phenolics, powerful antioxidants that work in multiple ways to prevent disease, are one major class of phytonutrients that have been widely studied. Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods. In whole grains, however, ""free"" phenolics accounted for less than 1% of the total, while the remaining 99% were in ""bound"" form.<query> what is phenolics</query> home - who we are - what's new - getting started - community - Search The George Mateljan Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation with no commercial interests or advertising, is a new force for change to help make a healthier you and a healthier world. Printer friendly version Quinoa Although not a common item in most kitchens today, quinoa is an amino acid-rich (protein) seed that has a fluffy, creamy, slightly crunchy texture and a somewhat nutty flavor when cooked. Quinoa is available in your local health food stores throughout the year. Most commonly considered a grain, quinoa is actually a relative of leafy green vegetables like spinach and Swiss chard. It is a recently rediscovered ancient ""grain"" once considered ""the gold of the Incas.""

Store quinoa in an airtight container. It will keep for a longer period of time, approximately three to six months, if stored in the refrigerator. Tips for Preparing and Cooking Tips for Preparing Quinoa While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands. To ensure that the saponins have been completely removed, taste a few seeds. If they still have a bitter taste, continue the rinsing process.<query> how long can you keep quinoa in the refrigerator</query> This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Quinoa provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System.

In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients. Because quinoa is a very good source of manganese as well as a good source of magnesium, folate, and phosphorus, this ""grain"" may be especially valuable for persons with migraine headaches, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Help for Migraine Headaches If you are prone to migraines, try adding quinoa to your diet. Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years. Arch Intern Med. 2007 Mar 12;167(5):490-6.; Eur Heart J. 2006 Mar;27(6):641-3. Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5.

For quick, easy, heart-healthy, whole grain recipes, clickThe World's Healthiest Foods, and look at the ""How to Enjoy"" section in any of our grain profiles. Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women. (Cade JE, Burley VJ, et al. ,International Journal of Epidemiology).<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Pre-menopausal women eating the most fiber (>30 grams daily) more than halved their risk of developing breast cancer, enjoying a 52% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women whose diets supplied the least fiber (<20 grams/day). Fiber supplied by whole grains offered the most protection. Pre-menopausal women eating the most whole grain fiber (at least 13 g/day) had a 41% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest whole grain fiber intake (4 g or less per day). Fiber from fruit was also protective. Pre-menopausal women whose diets supplied the most fiber from fruit (at least 6 g/day) had a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest fruit fiber intake (2 g or less per day).<query> what is the best fiber for premenopausal women</query>"

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world.<query> what is the benefit of telecommunications technology</query> As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.
