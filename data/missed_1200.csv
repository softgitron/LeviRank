Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

Comparing professional digital camera With this concept in mind, selecting the perfect digital camerato suit your needs has just gone from a Saturday afternoon in an electronics store to an extensive research campaign. With your primary objective in mind - to identify and price-shop so you get the mostcamera for your bucks – you'll want to make achecklist of the most important features to you as a professional or a "" prosumer,"" that is, an amateur possessing adequate skills to require a product with some level of professional featuresand functioning. Before you pin down and purchase any particular product, consider the following camera features and their importance to you. To best gauge all the possible matches, you may wish to create a comparative chart that evaluates the special features of each camera.<query> what is the most important feature of a digital camera</query> - Megapixels - Optical zoom - Digital zoom - Point-and-shoot functionality - Presets for landscape, portrait, sports photography, etc. - Other modes – Can you take movies? - Shutter speed - Start-up time - Flash sync - Color and white balance settings - LCD monitor size and settings - Power settings – Does it operate on rechargeable batteries? - And of course, price! Once you've become acquainted with the major features of a professional level digital camera and decided upon your budget, you can then begin researching particular brands and models. As an example, the Canon EOS 20D is a great match for professionals and for advanced amateurs alike. This technical device incorporates interchangeable lenses and 8.2 megapixels, making a ""bad picture"" almost impossible to take.<query> what is the best digital camera for professional use</query> Rivaling the Canon EOS 20D is the Nikon D70. This camera also features interchangeable lenses and 6.1 megapixels, also providing excellent clarity and detail. While these two cameras offer a wealth of handy features, a number of other models will also offer professional photographers and camera enthusiasts a nice array of utilities. Look into reputable brands, compile a checklist of your most critical features and speak with others who have professional cameras, even if it means visiting a chat room, message board or forum. Before you pay for your new toy, demand a chance to test it out, even if that means window-shopping for a little while. You can often test a camera inside the store and then purchase it online for a better deal if you shop smartly. With this in mind, you will definitely want to be comfortable with the camera prior to purchase, thus avoiding any inconveniences involved with returning or exchanging it for another model.<query> what is the best camera for professional photographers</query> Most importantly, do your homework and take your time.

Each lens is dominated by a wide rubberized manual zoom ring. There are marked detent positions for specific focal lengths, but there is no manual focus – that’s done in-camera. Nikon created a new Stepping Drive Motor for the CX mount, and it’s quite silent – very comparable to the full-ring motor Silent Wave on the F-mount. While the lenses have Vibration Reduction, there are no external controls – it’s all controlled in the camera by accessing a specific menu. Interestingly, there are no options to turn off VR, it’s on by default. Finally, each lens has a large button on the zoom ring – the zooms must be released from their most compact carry position in order to work correctly.<query> what is the zoom ring on a nikon camera</query> By doing so, the camera also automatically powers up. The reverse is not true – collapsing the lenses back to carry position is simply that. You’ll have to power down manually using the ON/OFF switch. Despite not having a dedicated EVF, the J1’s rear display was more than adequate to the task when composing, viewing and manipulating the camera. The display did not wash out easily, exhibited sharp and vibrant images, and had a very generous viewing angle. However the display is a drain on your battery life. With a CIPA rating of about 230 shots, the enthusiast user is going to need, not want, a second battery for maximum shoot time in the field. The lenses zoom rather smoothly, and there are no hitches or rough spots encountered. The hood on the telezoom is effective, and serves as secondary protection.<query> how many shots does a tele zoom camera take</query> Both lenses were easy to mount and dis-mount; the small size and weight complemented theNikon J1 quite nicely; it was difficult to tell at times which lens was on from a visual inspection – they’re that small and unobtrusive. The camera’s dearth of external controls has been the subject of much discussion since the 1 Series debuted. In particular, the lack of a true Function button, which could be reassigned to an often manipulated control such as ISO or White Balance, as well as an equivalent “Recent Settings” menu, would go a long way to addressing some of the concerns. In addition, the inability to disable Auto-Review of the last taken image does hamper the “flow” of shooting photos in the field. It remains to be seen if Nikon will address those changes in a future firmware revision.<query> what is the function button on a nikon camera</query> Performance In a single word – excellent. With some caveats covered below. Let’s talk about the focus capability first. There is no menu or external control to invoke Phase-Detect versus Contrast-Detect. The camera evaluates the ambient light values in the frame and decides accordingly. That “threshold” is difficult to quantify in a field-review, but you can easily tell when you’re in PD – especially if you chose Auto-Area AF – the rectangles light up and subjects immediately jump into focus – no hesitation. In fact, it felt very much like the Nikon D3100’s AutoArea AF performance. That’s not to say you’ll be replacing your D3 with this camera anytime soon – but the claim of DSLR-like focus performance is true. As light levels drop, the camera will switch to more traditional CD, which has the familiar one-step “stutter” at the end of the focusing operation to confirm the subject lock.<query> what is the focus of a nikon d3100</query> Nikon’s implementation of PD directly on-sensor is a promising innovation, and hopefully will be seen in future offerings from other makers as well. The PD is nicely complemented by a 73-point AF system – providing effective and wide coverage of the viewfinder area. You’ll be hard pressed to find a section not covered by an AF point. The CD gives you even more, with a 135-point coverage pattern. The subject really needs to have contrast under the AF point to optimize the lock-on, but overall the experience is like no other – I had the opportunity to let several other enthusiast and commercial shooters try out the camera briefly during a day-long road trip – they were all quite impressed and noted how the AF system made the camera feel very responsive for casual shooting.<query> what is af point on nikon cd</query> On the image quality side, theNikon J1 does not disappoint. Shots of the Provincetown harbor and other Cape Cod landmarks, in both rain and blue sky all reflect the color, contrast and sharpness typical of Nikon products and image processing. The Providence skyline exhibited good detail and excellent metering response, with no blowouts and good shadow detail. Colorful boats in P-Town harbor following a brief rainstorm. Nauset Light shrouded in a fast-moving storm front. Elevated perspective of the East Side, Providence R.I. Telephoto shot at 110mm max zoom (300mm equiv.) As a compact camera, theNikon J1 shines in terms of portability and convenience. With two zooms covering the most common focal lengths of 27-300mm and exhibiting a very low-profile, it was easy to pull the camera in and out of a jacket pocket for grab shots or to quickly swap lenses.<query> what is the zoom of nikon j1</query> From the forest pines of Rayce Point to the narrow alleys and beachfronts of Provincetown, it was easy to carry and yet the camera delivered some amazing wide-angles, zoom shots and close-ups. (Some samples thanks to Thomas P. Sisto) On the trail with fellow shutterbugs! Fungus close-ups from the forest floor. Monuments in the mist… Some “found” artwork patterns in a back alley… The beach at low tide… One of the advantages of ILCs is the lack of a mirror box assembly. The slap of the mirror system degrades the stability of certain exposures close to the hand-held shutter speed “danger zone.” Without that mirror challenge, your ability to hand-hold inside the zone goes up accordingly. While some of these shots lack any artistic or inspirational value, the first two frames below were at 1/4th and 1/5th respectively.<query> what is the advantage of ilc camera</query> Without VR, these types of photos would be impossible to obtain. Again, it was easy to keep theNikon J1 close at hand and keep an eye out for near-dusk and after-dark compositions. Low light Example 1 Low light Example 2 The “Superman Building” near Kennedy Plaza The Providence Statehouse at dusk Indoors, the camera’s limiting factor is based upon the CX lenses available now. The 10mm f2.8 pancake prime is a good start, but really isn’t that fast when talking about ambient light photography. In addition, the relatively low 1/60th flash synch ceiling imposes further challenges to action-freezing. The optional FT-1 adapter opens up options by allowing access to a bigger range of F-mount lenses, but the 2.7x crop factor effectively turns even a normal 50mm f1.8 into a mid-tele 135mm.<query> what is the limiting factor of a nikon j1</query> That’s great for portrait and stand-off shooters, not so good for those who prefer to get in close and wide. Despite those factors, the J1 didn’t do too badly in a typically fluorescent-lit karate studio or a restaurant interior with the slow zooms. The noise is noticeable but not objectionable, and with some NR post-process, the images can be cleaned up for reasonable size reproductions, web use or conversion to B&W. Karate studio work using the 30-110 Waiting for my breakfast! Caveats So what are the downsides? As a first-generation product, theNikon 1 Series does deliver on innovations such as PD on-sensor, as well as living up to the image quality one expects from the brand. However, it’s not that simple a proposition. Based on the design and features, the target audience is clearly the average compact P&S owner wanting to move up-tier, gaining more capability and access to interchangeable lenses.<query> what is the downside of the nikon j1</query> In that regard, the camera is a clear success. The tougher proposition is for the enthusiast - such as readers of SeriousCompacts.com. That market segment is not going to be fully satisfied by the current iteration of the 1 Series. TheNikon V1 would appeal more to the enthusiast crowd because of the integral EVF, but both models are constrained by a dearth of manual controls and limited lens system choices. That being said, this author and other photographers who had the opportunity to use the camera over the course of the evaluation all agree that if your type of photography lets you select a particular shooting mode and metering choice; the camera doesn’t get in the way. In fact, it was a liberating experience to just pay attention to the more artistic aspects of taking photos – the timing, the framing, the composition, etc.<query> what is the nikon v1 camera</query> LinkBack URL About LinkBacks Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page… Subscribe to this Thread… Search Thread Advanced Search Display Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode 03-05-2012, 06:34 PM #1 Covey22 New Member Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 2 Nikon J1 Review: A Field Report By Armando J. Heredia The Nikon 1 Series represents the long-awaited entry of a popular DSLR manufacturer into the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (ILC) market. TheNikon J1 model is the more consumer oriented version, and shares many common components and operating features with its enthusiast sibling, theNikon V1. The 1 Series stands out from the rapidly growing crowd of ILCs by a new sensor and hybrid AF system. Instead of iterating an APS-C body, Nikon chose to create a new sensor size and corresponding lens mount, an unexpected move to be sure.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> – the J1 took care of everything else. The PD AF system facilitated making the camera feel very responsive from shot-to-shot. But if you are a “fiddler” or enjoy complete and convenient access to all your camera’s controls, well, it’s going to be a tough sell. The relative lack of choices in lenses is simply a matter of time. Nikon will continue to iterate new CX mount optics, but the historic track record of times between releases doesn’t point to a quick rollout. Despite Nikon’s fine reputation for TTL flash, the onboard unit of the J1 doesn’t tie back into the larger CLS wireless system used by the DSLR product family. It’s a simple flash, period. Finally, there’s the price. At the USD599 starting point, theNikon J1 starts to bump up against the established lines at Olympus, Panasonic and Sony.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> The other manufacturers, by virtue of a head-start, enjoy advantages in price tiering, completeness of systems (i.e., lenses and accessory choices) and market penetration. At USD499, this could be a better seller. Conclusion As part of Nikon’s opening shot to the ILC market, theNikon J1 delivers on capability and performance. The Hybrid AF system really works, and the camera itself continues to live up to the manufacturer’s well-earned reputation as a leading provider of imaging technology. For compact users who are interested in moving up to a faster, higher performing camera and the potential of a larger imaging system (lenses and accessories); the J1 will satisfy. For enthusiast users, well, the only thing this author can recommend is to get down to a retail store and handle it for yourself.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> You may or may not find the dearth of controls to be inhibiting. From a cost perspective, this is where the rubber hits the road. The J1 is a first-generation model, and as such, early technology adopters have always paid a price – whether it was limited functionality, higher acquisition cost or both – to be first in line. With that philosophy, TheNikon 1 Series is priced accordingly – certainly not sky-high outrageous, but definitely not aiming to take market share based on competitive pricing. As such, buyers in general need to take a good hard look at the state of the market. The upside is that you’ll own one of the fastest and certainly one of the most innovative cameras today. The challenges will be to wait out the inevitable delay as more lenses and accessories become available, and seeing if changes in handling will occur through a firmware update.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> Overall, it’s a mixed recommendation – the Nikon J1 is great camera, but you’ll be paying a premium to have one.

She had a shocking pink 'J1' around her neck which, for some strange reason, she assumed I might like but I quickly put her straight on that!<query> what camera is used for slr</query> I spent a few minutes discussing cameras with her and pointed out that the 'V1' is a superbly designed camera which handles nicely, is unobtrusive, and 'designed' rather than styled like most of the others,...however, it is shot in it's foot by tiny sensor and MASSIVE over price being a staggering £700 here in the UK.... If I have my rate of exchange right thats about TWICE the US price!! I pointed out to her that, were nikon to make a similar camera with APS-C sensor and sensible (read; competitive) price then thye would have a showstopper on their hands. I, for one, would/will immediately change from my Sony NEX,... but as things stand why pay more for an inferior system in the same size package? I should add that the 'V1' is better designed and nicer in the hand than Sony NEX models but my minumum requirement is the APS-C sensor with 20x16 inch prints without any 'texture'...which my NEX 3 is well able to do.<query> what is the difference between nikon v1 and nex</query> ........

The design choice to produce only a 10MP resolving sensor is daring. Only four native lenses currently exist for the camera – a 10mm f2.8 pancake prime (equivalent 27mm), and two consumer-grade zooms, a 10-30mm f3.5-5.6 (equivalent 27-81mm), a 30-110mm f3.8-5.6 ED (equivalent 81-297mm) telephoto and a 10-110 mm f4.5-5.6 ED (equivalent 27-297mm) superzoom with a new silent Power Drive. The latter three lenses are equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR).

In lower light, the 1 Series would fall back to more traditional Contrast Detect (CD) sensors which are slower but more reliable in determining subject distance. The Nikon J1 also has some consumer-oriented and value-add features such as Motion Snapshot, which combines brief video and a still of the “decisive moment;” 1080P movie capture and slow-motion video (thanks to a high frame rate continuous mode). This review evaluated the camera’s still-photography features and has scoped out video functions accordingly. Initial Impressions The size of theNikon J1 is deceiving – at first glance, it’s no bigger than most of the lower-tier Coolpix P&S models that it displaces in the Nikon product family.<query> what is the nikon j1 camera</query> The J1 body is no larger in size than a typical compact P&S such as the Coolpix L22 As befitting the consumer tier, theNikon J1 comes in a variety of colors – our evaluation model came in metallic silver with matching two-tone 10-30mm and 30-100 mm zooms. Oddly, the telephoto had a lens hood, but the short zoom did not. There are dedicated hoods for all the native lenses except for the 10mm prime. The hoods can be reverse mounted for storage and both lenses have the latest Nikon “pinch-cap” versions for easy removal. Overall, the footprint occupied by the 1 Series and the two kit lenses is relatively small. It’s not the smallest ILC in the market, but it’s quite portable even in the two-kit form. The J1 with built-in flash deployed and the 30-110’s hood mounted.<query> what is the smallest nikon lens</query> The 1 Series can best be described as “pocketable,” though you’d need a large coat pocket or a modest purse or bag. Nonetheless, when compared to the smallest Nikon DSLR currently in the market – a D3100 – you immediately get a sense of the J1’s possibilities as a “carry everywhere” unit. Note the DSLR is sporting one of the smallest lenses possible – a 50mm f1.8 prime. The J1 still retains the general advantage of a larger, albeit slower zoom. The Nikon J1 next to its larger cousin the Nikon D3100 – the smaller camera is positively svelte. The front is mostly utilitarian – a large lens release button, a mostly bare gripping area on the right side (which has handling implications) , a pair of microphone inputs above the lens mount, a white-light AF assist and an IR input window round out the left the side.<query> what is the smallest nikon camera</query> While the lenses mount and dismount in the same direction as the F-mount, veteran Nikon users will be slightly put out by the need to align the lens using the large dash mounted at 12:00 rather than the more traditional 2:00 position. The rear is dominated by the large 3” display rated at 460K dots resolution, so the output can be a bit course at times. A small switch on the upper left activates the pop-up flash, which is deployed on a rather long and spindly support arm. On the right rear, you’ll find all the controls clustered together – a dedicated Function button, a vertical toggle that doubles as a command dial and zoom, and four buttons – Display, Play, Delete and Menu surrounding a combination control circular dial and a centered OK button.<query> what is the flash button on the nikon f-mount</query> Inside of the circle is the traditional four-way controller, which is marked for specific shortcuts such AE-L/AF-L, self-timer, flash mode and Exposure Compensation. To the right of the bottom plate is the combination hatch leading to the battery and SD/SDHC/SDXC compartment. The tripod mount is wisely aligned with the lens axis. The rear view of the J1. Overall, the feel of the camera is hefty, thanks to the mostly aluminum build, but a lot of the rear fascia is plastic. Nonetheless, there are no creaks and groans – everything is quite solid and well-assembled. Handling After a few minutes use, one of the gotchas of the 1 Series becomes apparent – it’s smooth yet striking industrial design exterior lacks any gripping areas for positive handholding.<query> what is the j1 camera</query> The more expensiveV1 features a minimal vertical “bar” on the right front that acts a friction point for your forefingers, but the J1 is completely bare in this regard. Nikon sells a dedicated GR-N2000 add-on handle, but it’s hard to take seriously at almost USD70 street. Several third party grips have become available at half the cost, and seem to do a much better job. The rear is a bit tight on grip space as well, as there is a small padded area available for your thumb right next to the mode dial, but should have been placed just a little bit higher for more optimal fit. Your other hand will likely be occupied supporting under the bottom plate and the mounted manual zoom lens. That’s not to say you can’t do the “one-hand” shooting style with this camera; it’s just that you won’t be doing it that often.<query> what is the nikon j1</query>"

Nikon The Bottom Line Beginning photographers typically look for two things in a point and shoot camera: Ease of use and a great value (meaning a good mix of price and features). Such cameras might not do everything perfectly, but they should outperform others in their price range.<query> what is the price of nikon coolpix</query> My Nikon Coolpix L20 review shows that this point and shoot digital camera fits those two critera almost perfectly. In addition, it features excellent response times. The Coolpix L20 (MSRP: $129) has almost noshutter lag, meaning you rarely miss a spontaneous photo. Nikon has created a very nice, basic, affordable camera for beginners with the L20. Pros Low price makes L20 a great value Very easy to use Camera's response times are very fast compared to others in this price range Easy to hold and shoot with one hand Handles odd lighting conditions very well Cons 3.6X optical zoom could be larger LCD can be difficult to see in bright sunlight Close-up focus could be better Battery life could be better Description Resolution: 10.0 megapixels Optical zoom: 3.6X (38-136mm) LCD: 3.0-inch, 230,000 pixels Maximum image size: 3648 x 2736 pixels Battery: two AA size Dimensions: 2.4 x 3.8 x 1.2 inches Weight: 4.8 ounces (no battery, no memory card) Image sensor: CCD 1/2.33 in.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> Guide Review - Nikon Coolpix L20 Review Image Quality For a budget-priced camera, the Coolpix L20 produces very good image quality, much better than most sub-$150 cameras. The automatic focus, exposure, and shutter speeds are accurate the vast majority of the time, producing sharp, bright photos. The L20 shoots good photos indoors, too, which often is an Achilles' heel of bargain-priced digital cameras. The only major drawback to the Coolpix L20's image quality is in extreme close-up photos, which rarely have sharp focus. The L20 could use a ""document""scene mode. It also would be nice if the L20 had a little more than its 10.0megapixels of resolution, but most beginning photographers will be OK with this model's resolution. Performance The L20's response times are very good, especially for a camera in this price range.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> It starts quickly, and it has a good shot-to-shot response time. The L20 is very easy to use as well. One area where the Coolpix L20 suffers a little bit is in battery life. It runs from two disposable AA batteries, and it seems to run out of battery power more quickly than other AA-powered cameras, probably, in part, because of its large, 3.0-inchLCD. Its overall battery life is below average, especially compared to cameras that run fromproprietary batteries. Design Nikon has created a good-looking camera in the L20, which is available only in deep red. It's a little wider on the right-hand side, which makes it easy to hold and operate one-handed. Had Nikon included a larger optical zoom lens than the 3.6X in the L20, it would've been nice.<query> what is the battery life of a coolpix camera</query> This camera isn't great for shooting nature photos from a distance or sports across a large field. The zoom does work in movie mode, however. The L20 cannot takewide angle photos, unfortunately. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the L20 delivers in the primary areas of importance for beginning photograhers. User Reviews 1 out of 5 Cheaply made, warranty no-good with Nikon, Member HappyShoppers This camera lasted less than 6 months. Downloading pictures, the screen went haywire. It seemed to be an electro problem. The only IMAGE that would display was a cracked screen. The screen itself is not damaged, and there is not even a scratch on the camera. We are very careful with our electronics. We sent it in, as directed, to the Nikon service dept. The service dept wants $99 to fix a camera that is under warranty, and only cost $89 to begin with!<query> what is the warranty on a nikon camera</query> They said the screen is cracked, and the damage was due to a heavy impact.

clueweb12-0205wb-63-31022,6,1,"Why is the Ocean Salty? Why is the Ocean Salty? By Herbert Swenson US Geological Survey Publication All water, even rain water, contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call ""salts."" But not all water tastes salty. Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment, and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test. It is one's taste buds that accept one water and reject another. A simple experiment illustrates this. Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet. Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present. Add a pinch of table salt to the second, and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a ""pinch."" But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> The salinity of ocean water varies. It is affected by such factors as melting of ice, inflow of river water, evaporation, rain, snowfall, wind, wave motion, and ocean currents that cause horizontal and vertical mixing of the saltwater. THE SALTIEST WATER... The saltiest water (40 o/oo ) occurs in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, where rates of evaporation are very high. Of the major oceans, the North Atlantic is the saltiest; its salinity averages about 37.9 o/oo. Within the North Atlantic, the saltiest part is the Sargasso Sea, an area of about 2 million square miles, located about 2,000 miles west of the Canary Islands. The Sargasso Sea is set apart from the open ocean by floating brown seaweed ""sargassum"" from which the sea gets its name.<query> what is the saltiest ocean</query> The saltiness of this sea is due in part to the high water temperature (up to 83º F) causing a high rate of evaporation and in part to its remoteness from land; because it is so far from land, it receives no fresh-water inflow. Low salinities occur in polar seas where the salt water is diluted by melting ice and continued precipitation. Partly landlocked seas or coastal inlets that receive substantial runoff from precipitation falling on the land also may have low salinities. The Baltic Sea ranges in salinity from about 5 to 15 o/oo. The salinity of the Black Sea is less than 20 o/oo. Water of the Puget Sound in the Tacoma, Wash., area ranges in salt content from 21 to about 27 o/oo. This area is drained by a number of fresh-water streams which discharge an average of about 4.1 billion gallons of water per day into Puget Sound.<query> what is the salinity of the black sea</query> Salinity of sea water along the coastal areas of the conterminous United States varies with the month of the year as well as with geographic location. For example, the salinity of the ocean water off Miami Beach, Fla., varies from about 34.8 o/oo in October to 36.4 o/oo in May and June, while diagonally across the country, off the coast of Astoria, Oregon, the salinity of sea water varies from 0.3 o/oo in April and May to 2.6 o/oo in October. The water off the coast of Miami Beach has a high salt content because it is undiluted sea water. Off the coast of Astoria, however, the sea water is less saline because it is mixed with the fresh water of the mighty Columbia. Sometimes river water travels far from shore before it mixes with sea water.<query> what is the salinity of ocean water</query> This is shown by data gathered from a study of the Columbia River, which, in an average year, carries to the ocean enough water to cover an area of 1 million acres to a depth of 197 feet. Using a radio- active tracer, scientists at Oregon State University have followed the river's water from its mouth near Astoria to a point southwest of Coos Bay, 217 miles away. The salt content of the open oceans, free from land influences, is rarely less than 33 o/oo and seldom more than 38 o/oo. Throughout the world, the salinity of sea water averages about 35 o/oo. This average salinity was obtained by William Dittmar in 1884 from chemical analyses of 77 sea water samples collected from many parts of the world during the scientific expedition of the British corvette, H.M.S. Challenger.<query> what is the average salinity of ocean water</query> The Challenger expedition, organized by the British Government at the suggestion of the Royal Society, set out to study the biology of the sea, examine the chemical and physical properties of the water, sample deposits on the ocean floor, and measure water temperatures. The voyage began in 1872 and ended almost 4 years later after covering 68,890 nautical miles. This expedition remains today the longest continuous scientific investigation of the ocean basins. Dittmar's 77 samples are still the only worldwide set of samples of sea water for which complete data (each principal constituent) on chemical composition are available. More recent data, reflecting improvements in analytical and sampling techniques, show slight deviations from Dittmar's results, but these changes do not affect the overall usefulness of his work. The average composition of the 77 samples is as shown on the following table.<query> what was the purpose of the challenger expedition</query> The salinity of water in the open sea is not fixed at 35 o/oo even in areas distant from land; that figure is only an average. On a worldwide basis, a maximum salinity of 36 o/oo occurs at about latitudes 20º N. and 20º S. The average salinity of sea water, 35 o/oo , occurs at the Equator. A minimum salinity of 31 o/oo corresponds approximately with latitude 60º N., whereas lowest salinities of 33 o/oo in the Southern Hemisphere occur at latitude 60º S. At the Equator, where salinity is 35 o/oo, the dilution of sea water by rain is offset by the loss of water by evaporation. But in the latitudes bordering the Equator the opposite condition prevails -- evaporation exceeds rainfall because high temperatures plus increased winds accelerate evaporation losses.<query> what is the average salinity of water</query> HOW SEA LIFE AFFECTS SEA WATER'S COMPOSITION... Inasmuch as the oceans receive most of their water from the rivers, the ratios (as distinguished from the total amounts) of different chemical constituents should be about the same in both regardless of total salt content. But this is not so. Comparisons of Dittmar's data on ocean water with the average salt concentrations in river waters of the world is as shown on the preceding table (above). Sea water and river water obviously are very different from each other: (1) Sodium and chloride (the components of common table salt) constitute a little more than 85 percent of the dissolved solids in ocean water and give to the water its characteristic salty taste, but they represent less than 16 percent of the salt content of river water. (2) Rivers carry to the sea more calcium than chloride, but the oceans nevertheless contain about 46 times more chloride than calcium.<query> what is the difference between sea water and river water</query> (3) Silica is a significant constituent of river water but not of sea water. (4) Calcium and bicarbonate account for nearly 50 percent of the dissolved solids in river water yet constitute less than 2 percent of the dissolved solids in ocean water. These variations seem contrary to what one would expect. Part of the explanation is the role played by marine life -- animals and plants -- in ocean water's composition. Sea water is not simply a solution of salts and dissolved gases unaffected by living organisms in the sea. Mollusks (oysters, clams, and mussels, for example) extract calcium from the sea to build their shells and skeletons. Foraminifers (very small one-celled sea animals) andcrustaceans (such as crabs, shrimp, lobsters, and barnacles) likewise take out large amounts of calcium salts to build their bodies.<query> what is the role of animals in the composition of ocean water</query> Coral reefs, common in warm tropical seas, consist mostly of limestone (calcium carbonate) formed over millions of years from the skeletons of billions of small corals and other sea animals. Plankton (tiny floating animal and plant life) also exerts control on the composition of sea water. Diatoms, members of the plankton community, require silica to form their shells and they draw heavily on the ocean's silica for this purpose. Some marine organisms concentrate or secrete chemical elements that are present in such minute amounts in sea water as to be almost undetectable: Lobsters concentrate copper and cobalt; snails secrete lead; the sea cucumber extracts vanadium; and sponges and certain seaweeds remove iodine from the sea. Sea life has a strong influence on the composition of sea water. However, some elements in sea water are not affected to any apparent extent by plant or animal life.<query> what is the composition of the ocean</query> For example, no known biological process removes the element sodium from the sea. In addition to biological influences, the factors of solubility and physical-chemical reaction rates also help to explain the composition of sea water. The solubility of a constituent may limit its concentration in sea water. Excess calcium (more calcium than the water can hold) may be precipitated out of the water and deposited on the sea floor as calcium carbonate. Presumably as a result of physical-chemical reactions not well understood, the metal manganese occurs as nodules in many places on the ocean floor. Similarly,phosphorite (phosphate rock) is found in large amounts on the sea bottom off southern California and in lesser amounts in several other places. NEAR-CONSTANT RATIOS OF MAJOR CONSTITUENTS... Although the composition of sea water differs from that of river water, the proportions of the major constituents of sea water are almost constant throughout the world.<query> what is the composition of sea water</query> Obviously, the ocean, in contrast to the water we use daily, contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals; it is too salty for human consumption. HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN?... How salty the ocean is, however, defies ordinary comprehension. Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons (50 million billion tons) of dissolved solids. If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick, about the height of a 40-story office building. The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake. For example, when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt, but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth (0.01) of a pound of salt, or about one sixth of an ounce.<query> how much salt is in the ocean</query> Dittmar's 77 samples showed no significant global differences in relative composition, and his average concentrations are used today to represent the ratios of major constituents in sea water. The analyses, which Dittmar made over a period of 9 years, further showed that chloride, sodium, magnesium, sulfate, calcium, and potassium make up 99 percent of the dissolved solids in sea water. Dittmar's findings may be expressed in another way: although the salinity or total salt content may vary from place to place, the ratio of any one major constituent of sea water (chloride as an example) to the total content is nearly constant. However, the ratios of the less abundant elements (aluminum, copper, tin, and bismuth, for example) to total salt content are not constant nor are those of dissolved gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.<query> what is the composition of sea water</query> But establishment of the near constancy of the ratios of major constituents of sea water is important because it enables scientists to measure one principal element and then, by projection of ratios and correction for temperature and pressure, to calculate the other components in the water, thereby determining its salinity. SUMMARY... The ocean is salty because of the gradual concentration of dissolved chemicals eroded from the Earth's crust and washed into the sea. Solid and gaseous ejections from volcanoes, suspended particles swept to the ocean from the land by onshore winds, and materials dissolved from sediments deposited on the ocean floor have also contributed. Salinity is increased by evaporation or by freezing of sea ice and it is decreased as a result of rainfall, runoff, or the melting of ice. The average salinity of sea water is 35 o/oo, but concentrations as high as 40 o/oo are observed in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> Salinities are much less than average in coastal waters, in the polar seas, and near the mouths of large rivers. Sea water not only is much saltier than river water but it also differs in the proportion of the various salts. Sodium and chloride constitute 85 percent of the dissolved solids in sea water and account for the characteristic salty taste. Certain constituents in sea water, such as calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and silica, are partly taken out of solution by biological organisms, chemical precipitation, or physical-chemical reactions. In open water the chemical composition of sea water is nearly constant. Because of the stable ratios of the principal constituents to total salt content, the determination of one major constituent can be used to calculate sea water salinity. For minor constituents and dissolved gases the composition is variable and therefore ratios cannot be used to calculate salt Circulation and mixing, density and ocean currents, wind action, water temperature, solubility, and biochemical reactions are some of the factors that explain why the composition of water in the open sea is almost constant from place to place.<query> why is the chemical composition of sea water constant</query> This information is from a general interest publication (""Why is the Ocean Salty?"" By Herbert Swenson) prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey to provide information about the earth sciences, natural resources, and the environment. To obtain a catalog of additional titles in the series ""General Interest Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey,"" write: U.S. Geological Survey Branch of Distribution P.O. Box 25286 Denver, CO 80225 For sale by the U.S. Government Printing Office Superintendent of Documents, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328<query> why is the ocean salty</query> Thus, sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water. What arouses the scientist's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty, but why it isn't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it. Further, what is the origin of the sea and of its ""salts""? And how does one explain ocean water's remarkably uniform chemical composition? To these and related questions, scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood. Illustration: Sources of salts in the ocean. THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA... In popular language, ""ocean"" and ""sea"" are used interchangeably. Today's seas are the North and South Pacific, North and South Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas. Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> There are several theories about the origin of the seas, but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle. Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of ""degassing"" of the Earth's interior. According to this theory, the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth. After the Earth's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water, rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries. As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth's surface, the primeval ocean came into existence. The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet. SOURCES OF THE SALTS...<query> what is the origin of the ocean</query> Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything. Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas. Most of the ocean's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth's crust by weathering and erosion, the wearing down of mountains, and the dissolving action of rains and streams which transported their mineral washings to the sea. Some of the ocean's salts have been dissolved from rocks and sediments below its floor. Other sources of salts include the solid and gaseous materials that escaped from the Earth's crust through volcanic vents or that originated in the atmosphere. IF FRESH WATER FLOWS OUT TO THE SEA, WHY IS THE SEA STILL SALTY?... The Mississippi, Amazon, and Yukon Rivers empty respectively into the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, all of which are salty.<query> why is ocean water salty</query> Why aren't the oceans as fresh as the river waters that empty into them? Because the saltiness of the ocean is the result of several natural influences and processes, the salt load of the streams entering the ocean is just one of these factors. In the beginning the primeval seas must have been only slightly salty. But ever since the first rains descended upon the young Earth hundreds of millions of years ago and ran over the land breaking up rocks and transporting their minerals to the seas, the ocean has become saltier. It is estimated that the rivers and streams flowing from the United States alone discharge 225 million tons of dissolved solids and 513 million tons of suspended sediment annually to the sea. Recent calculations show yields of dissolved solids from other land masses that range from about 6 tons per square mile for Australia to about 120 tons per square mile for Europe.<query> why are the oceans salty</query> Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated 4 billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually. About the same tonnage of salt from the ocean water probably is deposited as sediment on the ocean bottom, and thus, yearly gains may offset yearly losses. In other words, the oceans today probably have a balanced salt input and outgo. Past accumulations of dissolved and suspended solids in the sea do not explain completely why the ocean is salty. Salts become concentrated in the sea because the Sun's heat distills or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea and leaves the salts behind. This process is part of the continual exchange of water between the Earth and the atmosphere that is called the hydrologic cycle. Water vapor rises from the ocean surface and is carried landward by the winds. When the vapor collides with a colder mass of air, it condenses (changes from a gas to a liquid) and falls to Earth as rain.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> The rain runs off into streams which in turn transport water to the ocean. Evaporation from both the land and the ocean again causes water to return to the atmosphere as vapor and the cycle starts anew. The ocean, then, is not fresh like river water because of the huge accumulation of salts by evaporation and the contribution of raw salts from the land. In fact, since the first rainfall, the seas have become saltier. SEA WATER IS NOT SIMPLE... Scientists have studied the ocean's water for more than a century, but they still do not have a complete understanding of its chemical composition. This is partly due to the lack of precise methods and procedures for measuring the constituents in sea water. Some of the problems confronting scientists stem from the enormous size of the oceans, which cover about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, and the complex chemical system inherent in a marine environment in which constituents of sea water have intermingled over vast periods of time.<query> why is ocean water not fresh</query> At least 72 chemical elements have been identified in sea water, most in extremely small amounts. Probably all the Earth's naturally occurring elements exist in the sea. Elements may combine in various ways and form insoluble products (or precipitates) that sink to the ocean floor. But even these precipitates are subject to chemical alteration because of the overlying sea water which continues to exert its environmental influence. SALINITY AND ITS VARIABILITY... Oceanographers report salinity (total salt content) and the concentrations of individual chemical constituents in sea water -- chloride, sodium, or magnesium for example -- inparts per thousand, for which the symbol o/oo is used. That is, a salinity of 35 o/oo means 35 pounds of salt per 1,000 pounds of sea water. Similarly, a sodium concentration of 10 o/oo means 10 pounds of sodium per 1,000 pounds of water.<query> what is the chemical composition of seawater</query>"

Email Share Close del.icio.us Digg Facebook reddit StumbleUpon Twitter E-mail It Recipients' Email Address: Your Name: Your Email Address: NOTE:<query> what should you really eat</query> The guidelines say that it's okay to eat up to half of our bread, cereal, rice, pasta, and other grain foods in their fiber- and nutrient-depleted, refined forms. That’s unfortunate, because in the body, refined grains like white bread and white rice act just like sugar. Over time, eating too much of these refined grain foods can make it harder to control weight, and can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Too lenient on red meat and processed meat. High intakes of red meat, such as beef, pork, and lamb, are associated with a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. (4-6) Yet nowhere in the guidelines does it say to limit red meat. The guidelines also don't give adequate warning about the hazards of processed meats, such as bacon and hot dogs, which are even more strongly linked to heart disease and diabetes.<query> foods that raise risk of diabetes</query> Too much dairy. The guidelines’ recommendation to increase the intake of low-fat milk and dairy products seems to reflect the interests of the powerful dairy industry more so than the latest science. There is little, if any, evidence that eating dairy prevents osteoporosis or fractures, and there is considerable evidence that high dairy product consumption is associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. (Read more aboutcalcium, milk and health.) The Problems with MyPyramid and MyPlate Distilling nutrition advice into a pyramid has its merits: The shape immediately suggests that some foods are good and should be eaten often, and that others aren't so good and should be eaten only occasionally. The layers represent major food groups that contribute to the total diet. MyPyramid tried to do this in an abstract way, without any text or food images on it, and failed.<query> why is dairy bad for you</query> And it forced people to go to a Web site to learn what they should eat. (Read more about theproblems with MyPyramid and its predecessor, the original Food Guide Pyramid.) The MyPlate icon is an improvement over MyPyramid: It shows a circle divided into four brightly-colored wedges, each labeled with the name of a food group. Vegetables (green) and fruits (red) take up half the plate. Proteins (purple) and grains (brown) each get one quarter of the plate. Just off to the side is a smaller blue circle for dairy products, looking a bit like a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt. A fork and placemat complete the place setting. The MyPlate icon nudges Americans to put more produce on their plates, but it still falls short on giving people all the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> what is the food icon on myplate</query> And as a shorthand version of the US government’s nutrition advice, MyPlate suffers from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010’s shortcomings, as well. MyPlate does not show that whole grains are a better choice than refined grains, for example, or that beans, nuts, fish, and chicken are healthier choices than red meat. Healthy fats—key to heart health and to lowering the risk of diabetes—do not appear at all on the plate or the table. Yet dairy is given a prominent place right next to the plate, despite evidence that high intakes of dairy products do not reduce the risk of osteoporosis and may increase the risk of some chronic diseases. Perhaps the greatest problem is that MyPlate is silent on the large portion of the US diet that's junk: sugary drinks, sweets, salty processed foods, refined grains, and the like.<query> what is myplate</query> Building a Better Pyramid and Plate If the only goal of the USDA's food icons is to give us the best possible advice for healthy eating, then they should be grounded in the evidence and be independent of commercial interests. Instead of waiting for this to happen, nutrition experts from the Harvard School of Public Health created the Healthy Eating Pyramid, and updated it in 2008. And in September 2011, working with colleagues at Harvard Health Publications, they created the Healthy Eating Plate. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the best available scientific evidence about the links between diet and health. They fix fundamental flaws in the USDA food pyramids and plate and offer sound information to help people make better choices about what to eat. (View a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Pyramid, in a separate window; view a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Plate, in a separate window.) The Healthy Eating Pyramid The Healthy Eating Pyramid sits on a foundation of daily exercise and weight control.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Why? These two related elements strongly influence your chances of staying healthy. They also affect what you eat and how your food affects you. Exercise and weight control are also linked through the simple rule of energy balance: Weight change = calories in – calories out. If you burn as many calories as you take in each day, there's nothing left over for storage in fat cells, and weight remains the same. Eat more than you burn, though, and you end up adding fat and pounds. Regular exercise can help you control your weight, and it is a key part of any weight-loss effort. The other bricks of the Healthy Eating Pyramid include the following: Whole Grains Read more about whole grains. The body uses carbohydrates mainly for energy, and it can get them from many sources—some healthful (beans, vegetables, fruit, whole grains), and some not (sugary sodas and other drinks, sweets).<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The best grain sources of carbohydrates are whole grains such as oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and brown rice. They deliver the outer (bran) and inner (germ) layers along with energy-rich starch. The body can't digest whole grains as quickly as it can highly processed carbohydrates such as white flour. This keeps blood sugar and insulin levels from rising, then falling, too quickly. Better control of blood sugar and insulin can keep hunger at bay and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Healthy Fats and Oils Read more about healthy fats. Surprised that the Healthy Eating Pyramid puts some fats near the base, indicating they are okay to eat? Although this recommendation seems to go against conventional wisdom, it's exactly in line with the evidence and with common eating habits.<query> what is the best source of carbohydrates for diabetes</query> The average American gets one-third or more of his or her daily calories from fats, so placing them near the foundation of the pyramid makes sense. Note, though, that it specifically mentions healthy fats and oils, not all types of fat. Good sources of healthy unsaturated fats include olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and other vegetable oils; trans fat–free margarines; nuts, seeds, and avocados; and fatty fish such as salmon. These healthy fats not only improve cholesterol levels (when eaten in place of highly processed carbohydrates), but the fats in fish can also protect the heart from sudden and potentially deadly rhythm problems. Vegetables and Fruits Read more about veggies and fruits. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits has bountiful benefits. Among them: It can decrease the chances of having a heart attack or stroke; possibly protect against some types of cancers; lower blood pressure; help you avoid the painful intestinal ailment called diverticulitis; guard against cataract and macular degeneration, the major causes of vision loss among people over age 65; and add variety to your diet and wake up your palate.<query> what foods are healthy</query> On the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes don’t count as a vegetable, since they are chock full of rapidly digested starch, and they have the same effect on blood sugar as refined grains and sweets. That’s why potatoes are in the “Use Sparingly” tip. Nuts, Seeds, Beans, and Tofu Read more about healthy protein. These plant foods are excellent sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Beans include black beans, navy beans, garbanzos, lentils, and other beans that are usually sold dried. Many kinds of nuts contain healthy fats, and packages of some varieties (almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, and pistachios) can carry a label saying they're good for your heart. Eating nuts and beans in place of red meat or processed meat can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fish, Poultry, and Eggs Read more about omega 3s.<query> what foods are good for your heart</query> These foods are also important sources of protein. A wealth of research suggests that eating fish can reduce the risk of heart disease, since fish is rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Chicken and turkey are also good sources of protein and can be low in saturated fat. Eggs, which have long been demonized because they contain fairly high levels of cholesterol, aren't as bad as they've been cracked up to be. In fact, an egg is a much better breakfast than a doughnut cooked in an oil rich in trans fats or a bagel made from refined flour. People with diabetes or heart disease should limit their egg yolk consumption to no more than three a week; they can try egg whites, instead, which are very high in protein and are a fine substitute for whole eggs in omelets and baking.<query> what is the best breakfast for diabetics</query> Recipients' Email Address currently accepts only 5 email addresses separated by commas.

Building bone and keeping it strong takes calcium, vitamin D, exercise, and a whole lot more. So why does the Healthy Eating Pyramid recommend limiting dairy products, which have traditionally been Americans' main source of calcium and vitamin D? Because most people need more vitamin D than they can get from drinking three glasses of milk—and they need less calcium than three glasses of milk provide. Though there are some health benefits from modest dairy intake, high dairy intakes are associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. There are other healthier ways to get calcium than from milk and cheese, which can contain a lot of saturated fat; cheese is also high in sodium. If you enjoy dairy foods, stick to one to two servings a day; you may also need to take a multivitamin or vitamin D supplement to get enough vitamin D. If you don't like dairy products, taking a vitamin D and calcium supplement (or taking the right multivitamin) offers an easy and inexpensive way to meet your needs for these micronutrients.<query> what is the best food to eat to get calcium</query> Use Sparingly: Red Meat, Processed Meat, and Butter These foods sit at the top of the Healthy Eating Pyramid because they contain lots of saturated fat. Processed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats are also very high in added sodium. Eating a lot of red meat and processed meat has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. So it’s best to avoid processed meat, and to limit red meat to no more than twice a week. Switching to fish, chicken, nuts, or beans in place of red meat and processed meat can improve cholesterol levels and can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. So can switching from butter to olive oil. And eating fish has other benefits for the heart. Use Sparingly: Refined Grains—White Bread, Rice, and Pasta; Potatoes; Sugary Drinks and Sweets; Salt Read more about carbohydrates.<query> what to eat to lower cholesterol</query> Why are these all-American staples at the top, rather than the bottom, of the Healthy Eating Pyramid? White bread, white rice, white pasta, other refined grains, potatoes, sugary drinks, and sweets can cause fast and furious increases in blood sugar that can lead to weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic disorders. Whole grains cause slower, steadier increases in blood sugar that don't overwhelm the body's ability to handle carbohydrate. Read more about salt and sodium. The salt shaker should be used sparingly, based on extensive research linking high-sodium diets to increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Since most of the sodium in our diets comes from processed foods, such as cheese, breads, deli meats, spaghetti with sauce, and food prepared away from home, make sure to compare food labels and choose foods with the lowest sodium values.<query> foods that cause fasting blood sugar</query> Multivitamin with Extra Vitamin D (for Most People) Read more about vitamins. A daily multivitamin, multimineral supplement offers a kind of nutritional backup, especially when it includes some extra vitamin D. While a multivitamin can't in any way replace healthy eating, or make up for unhealthy eating, it can fill in the nutrient holes that may sometimes affect even the most careful eaters. You don't need an expensive name-brand or designer vitamin. Look for a multivitamin that meets the requirements of the USP (U.S. Pharmacopeia), an organization that sets standards for drugs and supplements. A standard, store-brand, RDA-level one is fine for most nutrients—except vitamin D. In addition to its bone-health benefits, there's growing evidence that getting some extra vitamin D can help lower the risk of colon and breast cancer.<query> what vitamins are good for you</query> Aim for getting at least 800 to 1,000 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day; multiple vitamins are now available with this amount. (Many people, especially those who spend the winter in the northern U.S. or have darker skin, will need extra vitamin D, often a total of 2,000 IU per day or more, to bring their blood levels up to an adequate range. If you fall into one of these groups, which would include most of the U.S. population, taking 2,000 IU is reasonable and well within the safe range. As always, it’s a good idea to discuss use of supplements with your doctor, and he or she may want to order a vitamin D blood test.) Optional: Alcohol in Moderation (Not for Everyone) Read more about alcohol. Scores of studies suggest that having an alcoholic drink a day lowers the risk of heart disease.<query> how much vitamin d should i take a day</query> Moderation is clearly important, since alcohol has risks as well as benefits. For men, a good balance point is one to two drinks a day; in general, however, the risks of drinking, even in moderation, exceed benefits until middle age. For women, it's at most one drink a day; women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy. Focus on Food Quality You'll notice that the Healthy Eating Pyramid does not give specific advice about the numbers of cups or ounces to have each day of specific foods. That's because it's not meant to be a rigid road map, and the amounts can vary depending on your body size and physical activity. It's a simple, general, flexible guide to how you should eat when you eat. To follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid, there's just one basic guideline to remember: A healthy diet includes more foods from the base of the pyramid than from the higher levels of the pyramid.<query> how many ounces of alcohol should i drink a day</query> Within this guideline, however, there's plenty of flexibility for different styles of eating and different food choices. A vegetarian can follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid by emphasizing nuts, beans, and other plant sources of protein, and choosing non-dairy sources of calcium and vitamin D; someone who eats animal products can choose fish or chicken for protein, with occasional red meat. Choosing a variety of fresh, whole foods from all the food groups below the ""Use Sparingly"" category in the Healthy Eating Pyramid will ensure that you get the nutrients you need. It will also dramatically lower your salt intake, since most of the salt in the U.S. diet lurks in processed food—canned soups, frozen dinners, deli meats, snack chips, and the like. Perhaps the only foods that are truly off-limits are foods that contain trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils.<query> what to eat on the healthy eating pyramid</query> Luckily, in the U.S. and Canada, trans fats must be listed on nutrition labels. More and more food manufacturers, restaurants, and even entire communities are going trans fat–free, making it easier to avoid this health-damaging type of fat. The Healthy Eating Plate When it’s time for dinner, most of us eat off of a plate. So think of the Healthy Eating Plate as a blueprint for a typical meal, for yourself and your family. It’s similar in concept to MyPlate, with colorful quadrants reserved for vegetables (green), fruits (red), protein (orange), and grains (brown). But unlike MyPlate, it offers important messages about diet quality, not just quantity: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. The more color, and the more variety, the better.<query> what is the healthy eating plate</query> Most Americans don't get enough vegetables, especially the dark green and red-orange types, or fruits. On the Healthy Eating Plate, just like the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes and French fries don't count as vegetables. Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains—not just any grains:MyPlate tells you to reserve a quarter of your plate for grains. But grains arenot essential for good health. What’s essential is to make any grains you eatwhole grains, since these have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than refined grains. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, oats, barley, and the like, as well as foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta. The less processed the whole grains, the better: Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested, and in turn, has a greater impact on blood sugar than more coarsely ground or intact grains.<query> what to eat to lower blood sugar</query> So choose steel cut oats instead of instant, sugared oats or choose whole wheatberries instead of whole wheat bread. Pick a healthy source of protein to fill one quarter of your plate: On MyPlate, the “protein” quadrant of the plate could be filled with a hamburger or hot dog. The Healthy Eating Plate, in contrast, acknowledges that some protein sources (fish, chicken, beans, nuts) are healthier than others (red meat and processed meat). Enjoy healthy fats. The glass bottle near the Healthy Eating Plate is a reminder to use healthy oils, like olive and canola, in cooking, on salad, and at the table. Limit butter, and avoid unhealthy trans fats. Though the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 acknowledges that Americans need to consume more plant oils, these healthy oils are nowhere to be found on MyPlate.<query> what is healthy eating plate</query> This simple illustration conveyed in a flash what the USDA said were the elements of a healthy diet. The Pyramid was taught in schools, appeared in countless media articles and brochures, and was plastered on cereal boxes and food labels.

On the Healthy Eating Plate, complete your meal with a glass of water, or if you like, a cup of tea orcoffee (which also are low calorie and have health benefits)—not the glass of milk that MyPlate recommends. (Questions about caffeine and kids? Read more.) Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day and limit juice to a small glass per day. Skip the sugary drinks. Stay active. The figure scampering across the bottom of the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Since two out of three U.S. adults and one in three children are overweight or obese, one thing is clear: Many of us have been choosing plates that are too large.<query> what to eat on a healthy eating plate</query> Using the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate complement each other. Both emphasize foods that promote good health. And both encourage people to limit or avoid foods and drinks that are harmful, or that provide lots of calories but have little nutritional value. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery list: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy oils, and healthy proteins like nuts, beans, fish, and chicken should make it into your shopping cart every week. Add a little yogurt or milk if you like. Skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. Let the Healthy Eating Plate be your guide to planning a healthy, balanced meal and serving it on a dinner plate—or packing it in a lunch box.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Put a copy on the refrigerator at home or at work, to give you a visual guide to portioning out a healthy plate, and a reminder to pump up the produce. The Healthy Eating Pyramid also addresses other aspects of a healthy lifestyle—exercise, weight control, vitamin D and multivitamin supplements, and moderation in alcohol for people who drink—so it’s a useful tool for health professionals and health educators. Other Alternatives to MyPlate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the companion Healthy Eating Plate summarize the best dietary information available today. They aren’t set in stone, though, because nutrition researchers will undoubtedly turn up new information in the years ahead. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate will change to reflect important new evidence. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate aren't the only alternatives to the USDA's MyPlate.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The Asian, Latin, Mediterranean, and vegetarian pyramids promoted by Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust are also good, evidence-based guides for healthy eating. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate take advantage of even more extensive research and offer a broader guide that is not based on a specific culture. The original Healthy Eating Pyramid is described in greater detail inEat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating, by Walter C. Willett, M.D. (the Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health) with Patrick J. Skerrett (published by Simon & Schuster, 2001, and Free Press, 2005). Evidence that Following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate Lowers Disease Risk What’s the payoff for following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate?<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> A lower risk of heart disease and premature death, according to research done at Harvard School of Public Health and elsewhere. (7- 9) Back in the 1990s, the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion created the Healthy Eating Index ""to measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns."" (10) A score of 100 meant following the federal recommendations (including those of the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid) to the letter while a score of 0 meant totally ignoring them. To see how well the principles embodied in the Healthy Eating Pyramid stacked up against the government's advice, Harvard School of Public Health researchers created an Alternate Healthy Eating Index with a scoring system similar to the USDA's index. They then compared the two indexes, using information about daily diets collected from more than 100,000 female nurses and male health professionals taking part in two long-term studies.<query> what is the usda food guide pyramid</query> Men who scored highest on the USDA's original Healthy Eating Index (meaning their diets most closely followed federal recommendations) reduced their overall risk of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic disease by 11 percent over 8 to 12 years of follow-up compared to those who scored lowest. Women who most closely followed the government's recommendations were only 3 percent less likely to have developed a chronic disease. (6) In comparison, scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index created at the Harvard School of Public Health did appear to correlate more closely with better health in both sexes. Men with high scores (those whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines) were 20 percent less likely to have developed a major chronic disease than those with low scores. Women with high scores lowered their overall risk by 11 percent.<query> what is the usda healthy eating index</query> Men whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by almost 40 percent; women with high scores lowered their risk by almost 30 percent. Two recent studies offer further evidence of the disease prevention benefits that accrue from following a diet similar to the Healthy Eating Pyramid: A study that tracked 7,319 British civil servants for 18 years found that men and women with the highest scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index had a 25 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 42 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease, than people with the lowest scores. (7) Another observational study in 93,676 post-menopausal women found that following a Healthy Eating Pyramid–style diet (as measured by adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was superior to following a low-fat diet at lowering cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk.<query> what is the benefit of the healthy eating pyramid</query> (8) References 1.

Its blueprint was based on shaky scientific evidence, and it barely changed over the years to reflect major advances in our understanding of the connection between diet and health. The USDA retired the Food Guide Pyramid in 2005 and replaced it with MyPyramid—basically the old Pyramid turned on its side, sans any explanatory text. Critics lambasted the symbol from the get-go for being vague and confusing. So in June 2011, with great fanfare, the USDA replaced its much-maligned MyPyramid with a new simpler food icon, the fruit-and-vegetable rich MyPlate. The good news is that these changes have dismantled and buried the original, flawed Food Guide Pyramid and its underwhelming MyPyramid successor. The bad news is that the new MyPlate icon, while an improvement over the Food Guide Pyramid and MyPyramid, still falls short on giving people the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> when was the food pyramid replaced</query> As an alternative to the USDA's nutrition advice, faculty members at the Harvard School of Public Health built the Healthy Eating Pyramid. It resembles the USDA's old pyramids in shape only. The Healthy Eating Pyramid takes into consideration, and puts into perspective, the wealth of research conducted during the last 20 years that has reshaped the definition of healthy eating. Now it's time to translate that research to your dinner plate: the Healthy Eating Plate. Just as the Healthy Eating Pyramid rectifies the mistakes of the USDA's food pyramids, the Healthy Eating Plate fixes the flaws in USDA's MyPlate. Both the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the latest science about how our food, drink, and activity choices affect our health. Building MyPyramid and MyPlate In the children's book Who Built the Pyramid?, (1) different people take credit for building the once-grand Egyptian pyramid of Senwosret.<query> who built the healthy eating pyramid</query> King Senwosret, of course, claims the honor. But so does his architect, the quarry master, the stonecutters, slaves, and the boys who carried water to the workers. The USDA's pyramids and MyPlate also had many builders. Some are obvious—USDA scientists, nutrition experts, staff members, and consultants. Others aren't. Intense lobbying efforts from a variety of food industries also helped shape the pyramid and the plate. In theory, the USDA’s food icons should reflect the nutrition advice assembled in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. According to the USDA, the guidelines ""provide authoritative advice for people two years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases."" This document, which by law must be considered for revision every five years, aims to offer sound nutrition advice that corresponds to the latest scientific research.<query> who were the builders of the usda pyramids</query> The government seeks advice from a scientific panel, one that must include nutrition experts who are leaders in pediatrics, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and public health. Selecting the panelists is no easy task, and is subject to intense lobbying from organizations such as the National Dairy Council, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Soft Drink Association, the American Meat Institute, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Salt Institute, and the Wheat Foods Council. (2) The scientific panel generates a report of 400 or so pages of dense nutrition-speak. The USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services use this report to prepare the 100-page Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The process, however, is less than transparent. And the folks who actually write the final guidelines don't always hew to the scientific panel's recommendations.<query> who is the scientific panel</query> The hefty Dietary Guidelines for Americans document is translated into a reader-friendly brochure aimed at helping the average person choose a balanced and healthy diet. Of far greater importance, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans set the standards for all federal nutrition programs, including the school lunch program, and help determine what food products Americans buy. In other words, the guidelines influence how billions of dollars are spent each year. So even minor changes can hurt or help a food industry and can also have a substantial impact on the health of Americans. Dietary Guidelines in the 21st Century: Progress, Not Perfection The Dietary Guidelines for Americans evolve with each new version. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 continues this trend of routine updates. ( 3) It also continues to reflect the tense interplay of science and the powerful food industry.<query> what is the purpose of the dietary guidelines for americans</query> Several of the recommendations in the current version represent important steps in the right direction: Move to a plant-based diet. The guidelines emphasize eating more foods from plants, such as vegetables and beans, whole grains, and nuts. Choose fish twice a week. They encourage Americans to eat more seafood in place of red meat or poultry, acknowledging its special benefits for the heart. Not all proteins are equally healthy. They recognize that some protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, and eggs, are higher in so-called “solid fats”—the saturated and trans fats that Americans need to cut back on—and recommend replacing them with fish and nuts, or choosing leaner forms of protein. Other recommendations do not go far enough to reflect the latest nutrition science—or bury key messages: Too lax on refined grains.<query> what is the best food to eat for a healthy heart</query>"

clueweb12-0909wb-33-12181,8,1,"Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP Random Hacks Technology and Other Fun Stuff Live Search: edit Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP Posted by Eric Kidd Sat, 03 Dec 2005 11:30:00 GMT Years ago, I looked at Ruby and decided to ignore it. Ruby wasn’t as popular as Python, and it wasn’t as powerful as LISP. So why should I bother? Of course, we could turn those criteria around. What if Ruby were more popular thanLISP, and more powerful than Python? Would that be enough to make Ruby interesting? Before answering this question, we should decide what makes LISP so powerful. Paul Graham haswritten eloquently about LISP’s virtues. But, for the sake of argument, I’d like to boil them down to two things: LISP is a dense functional language. LISP has programmatic macros.<query> why is ruby an acceptable lisp</query> If you need to download a web page, parse RSS, generate graphs, or call a SOAP API, you’re all set. Now, given a choice between a powerful language, and popular language, it may makeexcellent sense to pick the powerful one. But if the difference in power is minor, being popular has all sorts of nice advantages. In 2005, I’d think long and hard before choosing LISP over Ruby. I’d probably only do it if I needed optimized code, or macros which acted as full-fledged compilers. (Thank you to Michael Fromberger for reviewing an early draft of this essay.) Tags LISP, Macros, Recommended, Ruby Comments nuke edit Excellent Article said about 4 hours later: Eric, thank you for this excellent article. I have toyed with Lisp for several years now, and while I agree it is more powerful, I have made the decision to build my sites in Ruby for many of the reasons you have cited.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Instead of loop { obj.meth } it should have done loop.obj.meth which would complete it being Consistently Object Oriented™. You see, the great thing behind Lisp isn’t the macros, although they are nice. Instead, there are two real things that Lisp provides, which aren’t found in other language. To sum: 1): In Lisp, everything is a function. ‘If’ is a function, ‘cond’ is a function , ‘defun’ is a function. ‘and’ and ‘or’ are not logical operators, they are functions, too. They return values, as well. With that in mind, it becomes possible to write very powerfull, dense code. 2): Lisp has only one syntax rule (with the exeption of read macros): (function arguments). Any argument may be a function.<query> what is lisp macro</query> This is simple and consistent, and one can rely on it being this way. That’s not to say it isn’t mind-bending and it definitely can drive one mad. But it is the only syntax. If ruby had been just a little bit more consistent, it would truly have been ‘the newLISP’; instead, it is the latest new OO language. Mind you, Ruby is a very nice language and it has very nice (though imperfect) syntax, community and libraries, and for quick webapps, it definitely rocks. But it isn’t a new LISP, not by a long shot. nuke edit Eric said 2 days later: BDW, the operators you list (if, defun, etc.) are technically “special forms,” not functions, because they don’t necessarily evaluate all their arguments.<query> what language is ruby</query> Other than that, your point is good. Bill, here’s some Ruby code (based on ParseTree and an unpublished library of my own), which isn’tentirely unreasonable: assert_body(call(lit(2), :+, lit(3))) do 2 + 3 end The expression in parentheses builds a parse tree, which assert_body compares to the block’s AST. This is a small step towards recreating Paul’s example. Jamie, speaking as a minor contributor to several Lisp compilers, I doubt that Ruby will ever be as fast as Common Lisp. There’s two big obstacles: (1) Ruby metaprogramming happens at runtime, but Lisp macros run in the compiler. It’s hard to beat zero runtime cost. :-) (2) Ruby supports a variety of dynamic features, such as duck typing and method_missing, which are much harder to optimize than the equivalent features in Lisp.<query> is ruby faster than lisp</query> Of course, the best SmallTalk VMs are very good, and a hypothetical Ruby VM could certainly be adequate for almost all applications. nuke edit bill a said 2 days later: BDW, uh, a lot of the stuff in your comment is confusing and/or wrong. Look into that. nuke edit bill a said 2 days later: Eric, that’s cool. I figured ParseTree would eventually be able to do something like that. Still, I think that even writing macros in an intermediate format is a lot less convenient and maintainable than Lisp macros – what happens when the interface to ParseTree changes? What happens when a new version of Ruby comes out and breaks everything? I’m still sticking with Lisp. :) nuke edit PleaseDontKillMe said 2 days later: NOTE: I originally posted this on Zifus blog up there.<query> what is the difference between lisp and parsetree</query> Posting here for completion’s sake. You may accuse me of trolling, or you may read this document as something which has a degree of truth to it. [Snipped, on grounds of excessive profanity.

Winter break starts in two weeks. I will write, document, and release Lisp on a Ladder. I promise. Will that satisfy the naysayers? nuke edit Eric said 2 days later: Bill, if the interface to ParseTree changes, I’ll just hack around inside my library until the test cases run again. The code above is actually written against my own high-levelAPI, not against ParseTree itself.<query> when is winter break for lisp</query> The real danger is a VM change in Ruby 2.0, which would pretty much kill ParseTree. I suppose if somebody builds something stunningly cool right now, it might help keep ParseTree alive on a future VM. Not a good argument for a production system. :-/ nuke edit Johnny said 2 days later: (I know, I know…) I agree, my “PleaseDontKillMe” friend. Programming is a means, not an end in itself. Refurbishing your algorithms aren’t the purpose of programming. You need all the help that you can get, free or commercial, because programming is hard! Inviting people to the “hard side of the force” won’t work, ever. nuke edit Mike said 3 days later: You mention python in your article, but then you move to ruby.<query> why is programming a means</query> Ruby is a great language. I started in LISP in the late 80’s then went to python in the early 90’s. Python has always had native rich functional support. - lambda - map - apply Python 2.2 (release python now 2.4) added – iterators Python 2.4 added decorators that simplify generic programming. Here are some intersting python as LISP Nice article on LISP and Python comparison http://www.norvig.com/python-lisp.html Functional Programming in Python http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog.html http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog2.html MultiMethods: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pydisp.html Generic Programming: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-cppeak2/ nuke edit Eric said 3 days later: Thank you for the decorators link; that’s an especially nice approach. Ruby handles this a bit less gracefully. For more on lambda and map in Python, and why they’re not quite as helpful as they might be, see theearlier discussion. nuke edit Brad said 3 days later: Having read about 1/2 through the book, what strikes me is that Ruby seems to be roughly the same language as smalltalk (caveat, i don’t know the meta-programming layer fo Ruby) with a lot of extra syntax.<query> what is ruby programming language</query> As I read the Ruby code i see how with slight tweaks to turn it into smalltalk…which also looks a lot more elegant to me. nuke edit PleaseDontKillMe said 3 days later: Eric, I’m dissappointed. You could have just deleted the offensive words because the intent of the post was not to troll. But this is your blog and that is fine. Even though, there were some uncomfortable things that I said and I hope it wasn’t because of those uncomfortable truths (and I don’t meand the “F” words) that you decided to pull the comment whole hog. this also illustrates one of the points I tried to make. An un-necessarily haughty attitude when it comes to ideas which challenge the status-quo in our mind. My apologies for “excessive profanity”. What I find even more “profanerer” is all the talk about the beauty of our computational navels, while supposedly “inferior” languages whiz by us in the race for survival (essentially mindshare) You may be the sleekest species for a hundred million years, but if you can’t compete with the humble shrew, thenYOU are the eventual loser.<query> what is the definition of profanerer</query> I don’t care how many shiny scales and sharp fangs you got! Languages mold their speakers, and the speakers mold their languages. Latin and Sanskrit maybe the ‘best’ languages, but I wonder why the world don’t use them no-mo ?? My question to the Lispers/Forthers/Smalltakers was: Do you want to be the Sanskrit of the world, spoken only by the high-priests and teetring always on the brink of extinction owing your existence to the continued existence of the high-priests? or do you want to be the lingua franca, (lets say, English) of the world? Spoken by the masses to make their lives happen on a day to day basis? The choice is yours, and if you “love” the language, then you will do things which are not short-sighted in nature (closed source/obfuscation/needless punditry) and which help the cause of your so called ‘love’ (open sourcing, helping, creation of killer apps for mass penetration) By killer apps I don’t mean other dialects of the favorite language (or extremely expensive retail software) In cany case, thanks for starting a thought provoking post.<query> what language do they speak</query> ::AAEBACMD:: nuke edit Jim said 3 days later: bill a, Please make Lisp on a Ladder. Can you make it cross-platform? Will it run on more than one compiler? There’s a lot of fragmentation causing duplication of effort. What do we need to make a beautiful language like Lisp gain mindshare? The Lisp community needs more development and collaboration. It needs some more exciting things going on! nuke edit bill a said 4 days later: Jim: Yes, it would have to be as cross-platform and cross-implementation as humanly possible. I will be sure to test it onCLISP, since anything that runs on CLISP will run on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, Windows, etc. I’m also planning to release tutorial videos as part of the project (as soon as xvidcap stops crashing when I hit record) on a whole variety of topics, from the basics of Lisp, to using Emacs +SLIME, to the specifics of the Lisp on a Ladder framework, to developing a toy application (let’s say a blog) in some ridiculous amount of time – let’s say four minutes.<query> can lisp run on linux</query> I am constantly re-evaluating my choice of language tools, and have wondered if I made a mistake not building my site in Lisp. (It’s still in development now, but keep an eye our for Zifus around the first part of 2006). I recently read an article by the developers of reddit that suggested they are considering re-writing their site at some point in the future. He cited as a specific difficulty with Lisp that many of the libraries that quickly become available in other languages are slower to appear in Lisp because of the smaller community. Who knows if he was dissembling to throw potential competitors (like me) off track, but in the end it doesn’t matter, the point is valid. Whereas I have been incredibly happy with the progress of Rails as a framework, and I have been utterly delighted with my personal productivity in this wonderful framework.<query> why is lisp slower than other languages</query> While working on this, I’ve realized the answer to a challenge lots of people make: why is there no equivalent to Ruby on Rails in Lisp? I think the answer is that most frameworks exist to save their user the repetition and messiness of typing out similar constructs over and over. With macros, that need is less acute. With environments likeSLIME giving you information about what parameters a macro or function takes, this is also less important. In any case, here are some of the features I’m considering in LoaL: - at the user’s option, LoaL will automatically manage your database schema (this can be turned on or off on either a database-wide or a table-wide basis). So if I make a change to my model code, LoaL would check to make sure the schema matches what’s actually in the table.<query> why is lisp lisp</query> If it doesn’t, and the user isn’t in production mode, it will offer to bring the schema into line with the model, being careful to warn about dropping columns with data in them and so on. - compiled view templates, so minimal time is spent building a view to be sent to the user - instead of shoehorning things into the object-oriented model, LoaL will be able to define language constructs for specific tasks. In RoR, for instance, a method of the controller is automatically available to the public unless I make it private; LoaL will use a (defaction …) form that will make this a non-issue – things are only actions if you make them actions, because actions and methods are different concepts. - less stub generation than Rails. There will probably be some kind of stub generation available, but ideally it would only be to create the application directory and one or two files.<query> what is load model</query> With interactive development, figuring out what goes in a test file isn’t as difficult because the documentation for every macro and function is available at development-time; with macros, stubs aren’t needed as much because the user will be able to say things like (deftestsuite (deftestcase …...) ....) instead of relying on the framework to properly generate a test file. - in development mode (at least), LoaL will ideally give you more certainty about your code – making sure you don’t render nonexistent views or redirect to nonexistent actions; making sure you don’t refer to nonexistent columns in the table. There will be zero cost to this, because it will all be done at compile-time/load-time. (I haven’t completely decided whether this is worthwhile or not). - probably some more LoaL is inspired by Rails but it is neither a clone nor totally an attempt to redesign it.<query> why is load used in development</query> It will be more for public-relations reasons than anything else, since there are certainly frameworks coming that will do things better than LoaL will. Here is a darcs repository with an early, early, EARLY draft (DRAFT!) of some of the constructs LoaLMIGHT offer: loal repo . The file driver.lisp can be viewed in a browser and gives you an idea of whatMIGHT (have I stressed the tentative nature of this enough yet? No? OK, well, driver.lisp is the result of only about an hour of thinking, so I’m sure you can see that it will almost certainly change in drastic ways). There are the beginnings of a portal atloal-web Friendlier URL’s coming soon! Also, any tips on doing narrated video captures in X (on Linux) would be appreciated, since I can’t get xvidcap to stop hating me.<query> what is driver.lisp</query> nuke edit JAP said 4 days later: (for the sake of completeness): SB: thank you for correcting my ignorance, but here I would like to bring a statement of Albert Einstein: “make everything as simple as possible,but not simpler ! That says it all: when you go too far, then you loose something (maybe important), and here it would be:flexibility. So, you really can create some language that seems simpler than Lisp, but then at the same time you loose really too much! (Isn’t that really interesting? You can create a language out of, say, 25 primitive operators, and have something very handy, and you can create a language out of, say, 3 primitive operators, and you have something as-concise-as-no-one-could-ever-beat, but hey, you have lost all of the flexibility, and never will be able to convince the really smart people of this planet!)<query> who said make everything as simple as possible but not simpler</query> I would summarize it this way: the really “perfect formula” for making a programming language is to bring it to exactly that 7 primitive operators that are forming Lisp. Then you have “touched heaven”! (Please don’t take this too literally, I know that in practice this has to be extended, but not inspirit. Anyway, that doesn’t really touch the theory). Any comments, anybody? -JAP nuke edit Jules said 50 days later: There is a language called IO: http://www.guldheden.com/~sandin/amalthea.html It is a very simple language, the only thing is continuations. You can build pairs with continuations, and thus lists, integers, strings, trees. But it is really hard to understand. This: write 5; write 6; terminate Does a lot of things. It first calls “write” with TWO arguments: 5 and “write 6; terminate”.<query> what is the perfect programming language</query> This prints it’s first argument, and then executes the second argument (the rest of the program). write 6 does the same: print 6 to the screen, and call “terminate”. Terminate doesn’t call the rest of the program, so the program will terminate. Integers are continuations too: 1; → a; write a; terminate 1 is a “function” It calls the rest of the program with itself as an argument. The → thing assigns the argument to a, and calls the rest of the program. So you can express everything as continuations. It’s just nice to have these built-in integers and strings to make your programs cleaner, but they are not needed. So this language has only one concept: continuations. You can build for-loops with it, goto’s, etc.<query> what is the difference between an integer and a string</query> IO isVERY flexible. But does this make the language “better”? I find it very hard to understand, but function calls and for loops are hard to understand too (if you are not a programmer). With some practice, first-class continuations are very powerful tools, it’s the only thing you need. I think that every Lisp programmer should check this out. Hard to understand, but very powerfull, and you don’t need macros, because you can express everything concise with continuations. nuke edit Rhodry said 62 days later: Hey people, Interesting discussion. As a Ruby / Rails afficionado its been quite interesting to watch. But as a newbie “Pragmatic Programmer” I am trying to learn a new language each year. After the discussions above, 2006 may just be the “Common Lisp” year :) As a vaguely offtopic curiosity for the veteran Lisp hackers in the list … Has anyone looked at “Intentional Programming”?<query> what language is lisp</query> It was originally (10 years ago) a Microsoft Research project for interactive graphical generation / transformation and reduction of Abstract Syntax Trees [AST] – recently it has been taken into other commercial hands who are trying (but are always delaying) to realize a commercial solution http://www.intentsoft.com/. The original hype sounded brilliant – a graphically rich domain specific language integrated development environment [IDE] – but nothing has yet come of it. (Unlike Rails ) Now, given the vaunted regularity of syntax and metaprogramming capabilities of Lisp (not to mention the existentIDE features of Emacs), surely such a wide-scale, platform-neutral, domain specific graphical visualiser and metaprogrammer environment would fit better within a Lisp variant than Microsoft C/C++ [the original technology bootstrap].

Whatever language is closer to your thoughts… and better fits the solution :) {Might even reduce some of the language holy wars :)} Hoping to stimulate some thoughts… Rhodry nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said 76 days later: Not only is the Lisp world aware of Intentional Programming, Interlisp was likely the forerunner—and a well-known Lisper [1] was the cofounder of Simonyi’s intentional programming company.<query> what language is intentional programming</query> Excellent article, too bad I can post it on Zifus yet, but soon, very soon. nuke edit zlxcgrogdss said about 5 hours later: I’m looking forward to your next editorial, perhaps it could be titled something like “Why Java is an acceptable Forth”. Maybe, if I’m lucky, “Why assembly is an acceptable binary”. What I’m, err, hinting at, is that Ruby is not Lisp. A Lisp is a Lisp because it’s code is represented as its basic data structure. Ruby’s isn’t (unless you argue that Ruby’s code consists of strings, and string is a baic data structure; though I’m sure you’ll agree that this would be pure sophistry). Lisp without this property is like a wheel that isn’t round. The above distinction, along with all of its implications, is the reason Ruby can not be a substitute for Lisp, which, I am assuming, was what you meant to say when you erroneously called Ruby “a Lisp”.<query> why is ruby a lisp</query> http://wiki.alu.org/AudioVideo Kiczales, a coauthor of Lisp's metaobject protocol. Last I heard, he departed Intentsoft. nuke edit Rhodry said 88 days later: I humbly withdraw my misguided implication that the Lisp programming community were not involved in intentional software development and apologise for any offence…. Rhodry nuke edit Eleanor McHugh said 130 days later: As an academically savvy Ruby programmer who works on real-world application development I very much enjoyed reading your article, but I find the religious divide that’s apparent in various of the reactions to it rather strange. I came to Ruby via a circuitous route and my sole concern in using it is whether or not I can concentrate on the abstractions necessary to deliver a maintainable application efficiently and in a timely fashion: this is an area in which Ruby shines.<query> who is kiczales</query> It may have syntax, but it shares this feature with human language and most communications protocols – unsurprisingly really as at the end of the day both source code and real-world computational side-effects are intended for a human audience. Lisp has in part failed to gain mindshare with the broader development community because ultimately it is a mathematical abstraction and (whilst rare amongst classic hackers) most people are perturbed by mathematics. It is an interesting notation if one wishes to develop software as a symbolic representation of a computational parse tree but that is only one theoretical model of the programming process. Ruby on the other hand is an example of a class of languages that will become more prevalent in future years, where the abstractions that make Lisp so powerful are presented in a form that is palatable to those of us with an artistic/lingustic bias as opposed to a mathematical one.<query> why is lisp a good abstraction</query> This is not a new development. It seems to me that Ruby shares much in common with Icon and Pop-II (just asPERL does with SNOBOL), both languages that have found adherents outside the computer science fraternity despite their strong theoretical foundations. Where Ruby differs is that it has a killer application – the Internet. Anyone who has looked at the Rails web application framework can instantly see the potential compared to the slew of ad hoc scripting languages against which it is currently competing, and most of that power comes from the relative ease with which Ruby handles meta-programming. Ruby makes object orientation, functional meta-programming painless for the non-technical user and introduces elegance and beauty into tasks which whilst achieveable in many apparently equivalent languages would require inelegant hacks. In my opinion this is a very good thing because elegant software is in general easier to maintain – something which I’m sure the hardcore of Lisp hackers would recognise.<query> what is ruby used for</query> For me it’s not really a case of Lisp or Ruby being the more powerful language in an absolute sense, but of which is the more powerful tool in the hands of a particular developer looking to use the highest levels of abstraction possible with the minimum level of theoretical knowledge. As an amathematical person I consider Ruby more powerful for me as an individual, even though that may not be the case for many previous commentators. Given the ease with which a non-technical user can gain a good grasp of Ruby I suspect that it has the potential to be to network programming whatBASIC was to the microcomputer revolution of the 1970’s and 1980’s. The speed with which Ruby on Rails is taking off in the web development arena is just the tip of this particular iceberg. So to summarise: Ruby is a powerful language with a syntax that is easy even for non-programmers to get to grips with.<query> what is ruby language</query> It includes concepts to do with block closures, object-orientation and meta-programming which are usually absent from languages accessible to novice programmers and provides idioms for their usage which are easy to remember and use. There are without doubt architectural techniques which can be utilised more easily in Lisp, but as to whether or not those are techniques which are actively useful for general software development is something that I think is open to debate.

In response, I offer a Dijkstra quote: Don’t blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for ‘the average programmer’, you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.<query> what is lisp used for</query> nuke edit cmy said 149 days later: Eleanor, excellent comment.

More can be said in Lisp’s defence than you say. Macros can be used not just to make lambdas more consize.<query> what is the ruby example</query> If you consider the above expression hard to read, and prefer to read in the order of computation, as in your Ruby example, take a look at this: (stream-2nd-arg ‘(1 2 3) (mapcar (lambda (n) ( n n))) (remove-if (lambda (n) (= (mod n 3) 1)))) Note that mapcar and remove-if have no 2nd argument. Where do they get it from? From the previous computation. The first arg to ‘stream-2nd-arg’ macro is evaluated first. Other args are function calls evaluated after that in turn, and each gets their 2nd argument from the previous call. Simple, concise and readable too. The implementation of stream-2nd-arg macro is left as an excersize to the reader :) nuke edit John Collins said 165 days later: I am so glad I found a guru versed in all 3 of: Ruby, LISP, and functional programming.<query> what is the stream 2nd arg</query> In LISP and Python, I can use the apply function to pass a parameter list to a function declared to accept those parameters and bind them directly to each of the formal parameters in the declaration of the called function. In Ruby, sure, I can pass a list of parameters as a single list to a *parameter. But that is not what I want to do. Any idea of how to carry this off in Ruby, or is a close analog to the apply function just missing from Ruby? nuke edit Eric said 169 days later: Try this: obj.meth arg1, arg2, *more_args It’s roughly equivalent to Scheme’s “apply.” nuke edit Notav A. said 191 days later: (apply (lambda (a b) (+ a b)) ‘(1 2)) can be done with: lambda{|a,b| a+b}.call(*[1,2]) nuke edit someone said 202 days later: Do Lisp coders write programs or do they just sit around talking about their language?<query> how to use the apply function in ruby</query> It seems to be in use deep within the halls of CS departments and AI research, but in years and years of working with software, managing systems, writing for more OSes and problem domains than I can keep track of, I haven’t encountered a scrap of Lisp code or even a similar project to my own in which someone was using Lisp. I don’t mean to flame, but I’ve seen roughly a thousand times more talking about Lisp than the using of it. I’ve always meant to learn Lisp, but I get the sense that I’ll be applying the knowledge more on usenet than on actual programs. I’ve recently discovered Ruby, and of all its amazing strengths ( I’ll put at the top of the list—at least as far as something that you’ll probably see on any open vim session on my workstation these days—is the enumerable module ) nothing quite matches the friendliness and helpfulness of its community.<query> what is lisp used for</query> Ruby seems to be the first language to really get that languages are software and programmers are users. Programming communities need collective nouns. An obfuscation of Perl hackers. A stalwart of C coders. A furrow of assembly wranglers. An effusing of Ruby hackers. An ulcer ofCSS authors. A grumbling of Lisp coders. nuke edit Eric said 204 days later: I suppose it depends on your geographic location: I’ve spent at least 6 of the last 10 years working with Lisp and Scheme on both academic and commercial projects. But then again, I like to work on cool, offbeat stuff, and I live in the greater Boston area—two factors which, together, correlate highly with Lisp. If you’ve been working in AI, and you’ve never seen Lisp, the odds are extremely good that your work started after the late 80s.<query> what language is used by lisp</query> Ruby is neat and all, but let’s not get carried away. nuke edit bill a said about 6 hours later: I took basically the opposite path – I abanboned Ruby in favor of Lisp. You have some good points, and I agree that Ruby is the most Lispy language that isn’t actually a Lisp (CL, Scheme, Dylan). But although blocks can get you surprisingly close to macros, they can’t take you all the way there. As you pointed out, the implementation of macro-like code in Ruby tends to be ugly behind the scenes. Ruby’s syntax isn’t regular, and so can’t be operated on with macros. This means you’ve got to shoehorn various abstractions into doing what you want. Instead of processing the code passed to a block as a list and simply transforming it into something else, you have to define the elements of your mini-language as methods in some class.<query> what language is lisp</query> That’s when a combination of Moore’s Law and gross business incompetence killed off half the Lisp companies. Nonetheless, you should probably learn Lisp if you want to take full advantage of Ruby: The bookPractical Common Lisp contains 10 times as much meta-programming advice as all the Ruby documentation I’ve seen, combined. nuke edit William James said 264 days later: Here are some Ruby equivalents of some Lisp examples: (iter (for x in '(-1 2 -10 4)) (finding x maximizing (abs x))) [-1, 2, -10, 4].inject{|a,b| a.abs > b.abs ? a : b} # or [-1, 2, -10, 4].sort_by{|n| n.abs}.last (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 -4 -10 -43 49 49 8934)) (until (= (sqrt 7) x)) (collect x into collection) (finding x maximizing (abs x) into y) (finally (return (list collection y))))<query> what is lisp example</query> (By the way, I don’t think this Lisp will work as advertised. (= (sqrt 7) x) seems wrong.) def maxim a,b; (yield a) > (yield b) ? a : b; end y = 0 [1,2,3,-4,-10,-43,49,49,8934].inject([]){|a,n| break [a,y] if n==49 y = maxim(y,n){|x| x.abs} a << n } nuke edit William James said 265 days later: This version will work properly even if the list doesn’t contain 49; also, the variable y has been eliminated. def maxi a,b; (yield a) > (yield b) ? a : b; end [1,2,3,-4,-10,-43,49,49,8934].inject([[],0]){|a,n| break a if n==49 a[1] = maxi(a[1],n){|x| x.abs} a[0] << n ; a } nuke edit Miquel said 278 days later: I have to say that I work with lisp everyday and it is very powerful.<query> what is the function of lisp</query> I just haven’t got the motivation to make a decent interface to mysql for my web applications. That is why I chose Rails. Oh Well.. However, when the db support arrives, I am going back. nuke edit Pebblestone said 278 days later: Miquel: Try CLSQL, it supports multiple DBs and on multiple lisp implementations. And I just used it in my last project. nuke edit KristofU said 296 days later: I’m a C++ programmer, and was looking for a new language to learn and do stuff more elegantly. Ruby just sucked me right in. There is almost nothing to learn, it’s just there. You can slice and dice and juggle and the result is always a working program. You like for-statements? Well, you can use for-statements.<query> what language is ruby used for</query> You like iterators? Well, you can use iterators. Make object functors or lambda’s, whichever you prefer. Ruby doesn’t force anything upon you, there is time to learn to appreciate the finer features, while still churning out working apps in the meantime. I’ve also briefly tried Haskell, Scheme and Erlang, but I have to say, I couldn’t get anything done. Compared to Ruby, quite an anti-climax. nuke edit taw said 302 days later: You might be interested in RLisp, which is Lisp directly connected to Ruby runtime and very tightly integrated with Ruby. It is very alpha, but can do really cool stuff like HTTP server that uses webrick (from standard Ruby library) and macros. I think even at this early stage it is probably one of the most practical Lisps for scripting-style of programs, due to access to all Ruby libraries.<query> what is ruby lisp</query> The biggest problem right now seems to be culture shock, as RLisp has Ruby/Python-style let (this is the most controversial part, I don’t have any idea why), a “real” object system (based on message passing and everything-is-a-Ruby-object), and lists are arrays (so cdr/cons copy). Enjoy :-) nuke edit Simplicus said 304 days later: Why compare Ruby with Lisp and not with Erlang, Haskell or ML or other FP languages? I find this discussion very fruitful in many aspects. Yet the most interesting part of it for me personally is to what extent Ruby is a functional language? Or using Eric terminology how “functionally dense” Ruby really is? I have no doubts that Lisp and Scheme in particular can be used for functional programming (FP).<query> why is ruby different from lisp</query> Nevertheless both of these languages can be used equally well for non-functional programming also. Now back to my question: Why compare Ruby with Lisp and not with Erlang, Haskell or ML, or other “true” (Haskell) or “more functional” (Erlang, ML) FP languages? I understand that from the above mentioned FP languages only Erlang has no strict types and two others (Haskell and ML) are strict. Nevertheless, I think that we can still compare “functional density” of those with Ruby’s. I have 20+ years of programming experience, starting with DEC PDP-11 Macro Assembler and most of later work inOOP, such as C+ and then Java which I started to play with its first alpha release. That time I liked Java a lot compared to C++. During that “old times” I had also a chance to get to knowCLOS and was charmed with its powerful ideas (lists = code = data, generic functions,MOP, to name a few), uniformity and simplicity.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Unfortunately, that time (and today as well) I couldn’t find a way to do my living working on Lisp or Scheme projects, though I did some work in AI related areas (and learned many other “small” and “big” languages including Prolog) . About three years ago I started to research FP quite seriously, trying to find programming tools (languages) more powerful then Java and otherOOP languages that I could use to implement some of the ideas waiting in silo quite for a long time already. I started with Scheme, then ML and now Haskell which I like most for its clarity and power. In between I am looking at Erlang and Ruby. Returning back to “FP density” Scheme and Lisp lack some powerful constructs that ML and Haskell have and that I find very important for uniformity, clarity, readability and expressiveness of the language.<query> what language is lisp</query> (Mind you, I love them all Haskell, Scheme and Lisp :) These things are: 1) Guards (Haskell) 2) Pattern matching (Haskell, ML, Erlang) 3) List comprehensions (Haskell) Guards example: max :: Int -> Int -> Int max x y | x >=y = x | otherwise = y Example of both pattern matching and comprehensions – quick sort in Haskell is simple as that: qSort :: [Int] -> [Int] qSort [] = [] qSort (x:xs) = qSort [ y | y <-xs, y<=x] ++ [x] ++ qSort [ y | y<-xs, y > x] This code is very close to informal definition of quick sort: “To sort the list take off the head â€˜(x:xs)’ and then split the result in two parts: the first containing the elements no larger then â€˜x’ and the second exceeding â€˜x’.<query> what is quick sort in haskell</query> Sort these two parts and then concatenate â€˜x’ with results of these two sorts” Isn’ it clarity and readability? Isn’t purely functional notation is better then a notaion produced by macros? What Ruby gives as equivalent to Guards, Pattern matching and List comprehensions? I am not even talking about extremely powerful strategy of lazy evaluation that allows Haskell only evaluate a function argument when it is really needed (on demand) to compute the overall result. This in turn makes computations less expensive and allows language to describe infinite data structures. As almost everything else, lazy evaluation can be implemented in Lisp and Scheme. Any ideas how to do this in Ruby? After Haskell, Ruby syntax looks too eclectic for me (foo, @bar, baz :faz => xxx), â€˜blocks’ and â€˜yields’ makes me feel sorry for functions as first class objects, “meta programming” seems for me to be a perfect tool to hide and obscure what is really going on behind the code I see right now (because methods can be added to classes in other source files), etc… Maybe I am totally wrong about Ruby and will drastically change my opinion after more experience with it, we’ll see.<query> what is lazy evaluation in ruby</query> As for this discussion it would be interesting to know what you guys think about: 1) The question I started this message with 2) Why Haskell (and FP in general) is not as widespread as Java, Python & Ruby? And all these sad things are happening in spite of: a. Though not so big but very strong and dedicated community of Haskell developers. b. Constantly growing set of open source Haskell applications, tools and libraries. nuke edit schemer said 320 days later: Simplicus, I would agree that pattern matching and guards are awesome, even in the absense of types. I mainly code in Scheme, but I was absolutely blown away by Monads and lazy evaluation when I tried Haskell. I can’t belive most programmers consider those aspects of Haskell a turn off, both are techniques which I was earlier trying to reinvent while programming in Scheme while not even realizing it.<query> why is haskell not as widely used as java</query> The pervasiveness of Ruby’s OO becomes a hassle here. (Sure, lots of defmacro’s end up being ugly too, but at least they’re conceptually cleaner). And all user-defined languages and structures immediately stand out because they have to be set off with the “do” keyword. There are too many things about Lisp that no other language will ever get unless it is also a Lisp. The ability to move through sexp’s with Emacs keychords is priceless. The simple structure of Lisp and its lack of arbitrary syntax makes it easy to provide good editing support. The whole idea of interactive development rocks. The ability to, in most implementations, compile to native code rocks as well. Lisp is pretty mature, and while there are a few quirks to it, 50 years of existence will go a long way toward making a programming language great.<query> what is lisp used for</query> However, from personal experience, I would have to note that there is no reason why scheme can’t have those features; (There are libraries for pattern matching as you presumed, and there are As for what I think makes scheme less “functionally dense” than Haskell are: Scheme’s mutable define, mutable cons, and non-imperative i/o are what make it less functional than Haskell. Of course, these features that I mentioned aren’t really fundamental properties of the language, both in my opinion are historical cruft that I hope someday will be fixed… On the other hand, I’d love to see a sexpr Haskell. :) As for ruby, I don’t consider it to be “functional,” (although I wouldn’t be surpised if ruby programmers were fond of hofs) because as far as I know, it doesn’t have tail-call optimization.<query> what makes scheme less functional</query> With Common Lisp, even though it doesn’t have tco, every major compiler out there (CMUCL,SBCL, probably also CLisp) optimizes tail calls, so I have no particular problem with CL, assuming a very non-idiomatic style to CL. TCO is a big deal for me, because in Elisp I have to use destructive maps/filters to avoid exceeding the functional call depth, that’s really annoying… nuke edit schemer said 320 days later: Argh. I made some bad typos to my post: I meant lack of non-imperative i/o in my prior statement. Also, I forgot to note several prominent scheme hackers have implemented monads in scheme, though unfortunately there’s no standardized example… Lazy evaluation in scheme is also doable as you mentioned, even though I haven’t yet gottten the srfi for stream-define and friends working properly (apparently the my implementations’ modules are not compatable with it without extra macros) I also don’t grasp why the srfi for memoized streams uses set!<query> what is tco in scheme</query> when it could just use a helper function (but then again, I would say that this is a problem of mutable define in scheme) nuke edit William James said 325 days later: Quicksort in Ruby: def qsort ary return ary if ary == [] pivot = ary[0] left, right = ary[1..-1].partition{|x| x < pivot } qsort( left ) + [pivot] + qsort( right ) end nuke edit memeplex said 325 days later: Lack of community and codebase are strong impediments for every but a few language. Also most new languages are missing a standard ffi which let them easily access c/c+ legacy code, preferable via bindings autogenerated by tools like swig. In this regard, Lisp has cffi, which is a good thing. But anyway, you won’t get too far away without people doing the heavy lifting, all that enormous amount of binding code should be generated, patched and tested.<query> what is the cffi in ruby</query> It seems like the way to go for small communities is to parasite mature and well established runtimes, and to compile to their intermediate binary representation. Of course I’m talking of java and .net /mono/pnet here. They’re doing their thing pretty well, performance is more than acceptable, and taken as intermediate languages (which msil is more than java bytecode) they can even be compiled to native code (take for example gcj). I love scheme programming but I’m also fond of new oo+fp languages, namely scala or nemerle. Because of the reflection capabilities of this cross-language/cross-platform runtimes, binding is far easier than it is for C/C + native stuff. Sometimes it’s just a matter of importing modules and start using them. Admittedly, a generic runtime it’s not the same than a standard library tailored to an specific language.<query> what is msil language</query> But then those standard libraries could be build faster on top of the facilities offered by the runtime, and in case they are still not complete, one can always resort to the generic api, it’s not a cul-de-sac. Also you can easily bind to c/ c++ if you really need it: there are mature swig modules for java and c#, while there aren’t others for a lot of cool, tiny languages. I’m currently programming in bigloo scheme targeting the jvm, and in scala too (they both are able to generate code for the clr also, although support isn’t that mature already). I think it’s the way to go for languages with small communities. And in any case, these intermediate platforms promote code reuse, offer advanced interpretation/compilation techniques (while there could be lack of support for specific techniques, like tail-recursion, that’s a price to pay), powerful development environments, etc etc.<query> what is the difference between java and c++</query> Just how I’m feeling like lately. nuke edit Eric Kidd said 326 days later: Oh, I’m a huge fan of Haskell. The syntax is nice and dense (though occasionally a bit alien), and monads are a remarkably powerful abstraction. There’s a whole class of designs which can be easily expressed with monads (unification, backtracking, transactions, continuations-as-a-library, localized state, modular parsers, and so on). A lot of these designs can’t be implemented cleanly with Lisp macros (unless you write a code-walker, or an entire embedded language). It also seems that monads are most useful when you can have more than one of them, and when you can overload your monadic operations depending on the return type of your function. This is the biggest barrier I’ve found to using monadic code in Scheme.<query> what is monads</query> Haskell is a fairly hard programming language, and I doubt it will ever go mainstream. But it’s by far one of the most interesting languages on the scene, and I learn a lot programming in it. My biggest complaint is the lack of subtyping, which is fixed by O’Haskell. If I had to recommend four languages to learn, I’d recommend Ruby (because it’s so fun), Lisp/Scheme (for the macros), Oz (for unification, concurrent logic and constraints) and Haskell (for monads and for the deeply mathematical style). nuke edit scripting geek said 374 days later: Very interesting and enjoyable discussion! I did LISP and Scheme for a few years in the early 90s, doing AI at Berkeley. Looking back over that code some years later, just for fun, I was struck by the total impenetrability of my earlierLISP excretions.<query> what language do you learn to code in haskell</query> The resulting tangle of sexp was so nasty, I would have opted for ritual seppuku if required to decipher the stuff. But that’s just me and my substandardLISP code. On another tangent.. I’m finding the impassioned arguments about language properties very interesting, but ultimately somewhat irrelevant, at least insofar as productivity is concerned. I think that nowadays the breadth and quality of the available open source libraries is a much larger factor in the appeal of a language as a useful tool than are the theoretical upper limits of its expressive capability. Learning to live with somewhat clunky metaprogramming facilities as opposed to super-powerful macros is infinitely easier, I think, than lacking libraries for half the stuff you need done on a daily basis. It sounds as though LISP is still far behind the Python/Ruby camps insofar as that’s concerned, and for this reason alone I wouldn’t give it another look at this time.<query> what is the purpose of lisp</query> And, at least in my case, I learned that power of program-as-AST that’s so nice for computers is not so good for human comprehension, as we do not make good recursive tree evaluators. Beyond a modest level of nesting and layering, things start to look very nasty indeed. Python/Ruby on the other hand are very readable, with plenty of useful idioms captured by grammar or sugar, and have APIs to easily interact with just about everything. With tools such as these, I alone can replace a small department of C programmers, and that’s very appealing. nuke edit Chris Rathman said 406 days later: Since the topic is a comparison between Ruby and Lisp (and Simplicus expressed an interest in comparing Ruby with Haskell or ML or other FP languages), I thought I’d mention my pet project to translate theSICP examples into these languages. http://www.codepoetics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Topics:SICP_in_other_languages<query> what language is python compared to ruby</query> I’ve still got a lot to learn about Ruby, but in translating the first chapter and a half the main quirks I had with Ruby were (1) it’s lack of Tail Call Optimization – an attibute shared with Python and JavaScript (many in the Lisp community consider the lack ofTCO to be a bug); and (2) the distinction between named and anonymous functions. As far as I can tell, you can curry lambdas, but you can’t curry named functions – Erlang works this way as well. nuke edit gar37bic said 407 days later: This is a great discussion, and has been very informative for me. I’m thinking about which language I want to tackle next, primarily for research into areas such as neural networks. In my real life, I spend a lot of time writing heuristic filters based on regular expressions – (typically usingPCRE: ‘perl-compatible regex’, though I don’t use Perl) – to do things like parse, filter, sanitize and combine multiple legacy datasets into one ‘canonical’ set.<query> what language can you curry lambdas</query> I guess what bothers me about Ruby is its quirks. That might sound crazy, since it’s well-known that Common Lisp has more than its share of historical cruft. But I really cannot get my mind back into the framework of arbitrary syntax. It is ultimately useless. It prevents you from writing macros, it prevents editors from having flawless support for your language, and it prevents you from expressing yourself as concisely as you need to. Your lambda sample is indeed shorter in Ruby than in Lisp. But Ruby’s OO is not quite so clean in this situation: (defmethod sum-children ((c item)) (loop for child in (children-of item) sum (height-of child))) (mapcar #'sum-children list-o-children) I don’t think that can be done quite so easily in Ruby.<query> what is ruby lambda</query> This often requires running other programs to pre-sort incoming data streams, and then maintaining arrays of match-probability scores for possible matches. How would these languages address problems such as these? nuke edit gar37bic said 407 days later: I also often ‘scrape’ (with permission) HTML, SQL, CVS, PDF, DOC and other files off the net, to generate input data for our company’s data mining operation, for example corporate federal andSEC filings. And right now I’m scripting OpenOffice to do file format conversions to .DOC … nuke edit Eric Kidd said 407 days later: Chris Rathman: I thought I’d mention my pet project to translate theSICP examples into these languages. Oh, that’s really cool. Thanks for the link! nuke edit David A. Wheeler said 407 days later: One problem with traditional Lisp notation is that it’s fairly hard to read—and as programs get bigger, it gets worse.<query> what is the problem with lisp notation</query> It’s especially nasty when you use operators that are traditionally infix operators, e.g., (+ 3 (* 2 3)) may be a regular syntax, but even Graham admits it’s awkward. I’ve developed a notation called “sweet-expressions” which I think are easier to read. A sweet-expression readers can read normal s-expressions, but can also accept other formats. It still works with all the macro constructs, etc., of Lispy languages. More info is here: http://www.dwheeler.com/readable/ nuke edit A Total Coward said 410 days later: bill a: your links to LoaL are all 404s. Did this stuff every see any daylight? nuke edit Timmy Jose said 410 days later: For a programmer used to C/C++ and JAVA and having merely studied the rudimentaries of Lisp in college ( as part of A.I ) and having had to content myself by looking at Ruby from the sidelines till now, I found this thread extremely interesting.<query> what is sweet expression</query> It was all a bit one-sided though with Lispers outnumbering Rubyists (?) by a huge ratio! In my opinion, the syntax of Lisp seemed to be more in tune with my liking than Ruby’s. I think I’ll take the plunge with Lisp and see where Ruby fits in later. Good job on the discussion people! nuke edit Charlie Lindahl said 740 days later: I worked for a number of years on LISP machines at Texas Instruments in the 80s One of my points is : it’s the environment. Not just the IDE; in LISP and Smalltalk environmentsEVERYTYHING is written in the language in question/use (with the exception of machine-specific low-level stuff required to talk to theOS / machine architecture). What this means (not great for a general business case, but incredible for learning and expressive power) is that I can actually take apart / customize / study the underlying OS and/or tools.<query> what language is lisp</query> So, for example, say you don’t like the way EMACS works. Go grab the source (a keystroke away inLISP IDEs) and go plowing through it with the IDEs/debuggers and rewrite it to your specifications. I learned the Macintosh Toolbox structure by running Lisp on the Mac and dissecting the window data structures (on the fly / realtime ) without needing to have source code. Once Ruby gets to the point of this kind of power in the environment, inspection, and debugging it’ll be amazingly powerful. Quite good now from what I’ve seen so far.

Also, blocks are little more than callable code. You can try to impose some structure on them by defining appropriate methods and evaluating the block in a special context, but this is not the same as the code transformation macros provide. You cannot, for instance, selectively evaluate different expressions in different contexts. Consider: (let ((x 45)) (defclass foo () ((name :initform x)))) That will work because defclass will expand the initform (and only the initform!) into a lambda-expression and thus close over the x variable; nothing else will be evaluated in that context.<query> how to use def class in java</query> It’s also important to notice that defclass does not look any different than let, even though defclass is simply a macro, and let is a built-in special form. I will clearly go on for days unless I stop now. I was about to write about how let’s rock because you can limit a variable’s scope with absolute precision (not possible in Ruby) and then about how Marco Baringer implemented continuations in straight Lisp. To sum up: yes, Ruby is not that bad (maybe even “acceptable”) but Lisp owns. nuke edit Eric said about 7 hours later: Ruby’s most frustrating quirks, from a LISP perspective, tend to involve its scoping rules. Methods, variables and constants each have subtly different behavior. And as for block locals, even Matz admits that they’re pretty broken.<query> is ruby good for lisp</query> Let’s consider a Ruby version of LET: def let(*args) yield *args end let(1,2,3) {|x,y,z| z } This does exactly what you want if the variables are unbound: It introduces a new scope with three local variables. On the other hand, if any of the variables were previously bound, Ruby clobbers the existing bindings. Nasty. The biggest limitation of trading LISP’s compile-time macro expansion for Ruby’s metaclass hackery is launch time. Rails works around this using FCGI and on-demand class loading. These headaches aside, I’ve had very good luck porting LISP macros to Ruby. At this point, I could probably reimplement about half of the macros in On LISP without much trouble. Another quarter could be brute-forced using ParseTree, but that’s (arguably) cheating. I’ll talk more about these techniques in the coming months.<query> what is the ruby macro for lisp</query> nuke edit Anonymous said about 7 hours later: Hi. I’ll just assume here you always meant Common Lisp when you wrote LISP(it isn’t capitalised there, just like PERL and JAVA aren’t right). Before answering this question, we should decide what makes LISP so powerful. Paul Graham has written eloquently aboutLISP’s virtues. But, for the sake of argument, I’d like to boil them down to two things: LISP is a dense functional language. LISP has programmatic macros. Sorry to say, but that doesn’t reflect reality. If those were the two main reasons to use Common Lisp, most people probably wouldn’t. Incidentally, Paul Graham’s Common Lisp style is definitely atypical (google for “Graham Crackers”). His Scheme background/affection certainly shows, and he usually doesn’t mention all the other things that make Common Lisp so useful (unlike in Scheme, avoiding side-effects and using recursion instead of iteration in Common Lisp is rather rare).<query> why use lisp</query> As it turns out, Ruby compares well as a functional language, and it fakes macros better than I’d thought. Ruby is a denser functional language than LISP A dense language lets you say things concisely, without obfuscation. You can see more of your program in one glance, and there aren’t as many places for bugs to hide. Beyond a certain point, the only way to make programs denser is to use more powerful abstractions. One particularly powerful abstraction is lambda. Using lambda, you can create a new function on the fly, pass it to other functions, and even store it for later use. For example, if you wanted to double each number in a list, you might write: (mapcar (lambda (n) (* n 2)) mylist) mapcar creates a new list by transforming each element of mylist.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> Despite the roots, Common Lisp isn’t much of a “functional” language. It has all the necessary features, but imperative constructs andOOP play a major role in the language. It’s not Common Lisp if it doesn’t have the Common Lisp Object System; it also wouldn’t be anywhere as powerful without the condition system and all the other things (full numeric tower; the type system; etc.). I have no doubt that Ruby might match CL in the functional department, but that won’t get you very far. Common Lisp has come a long way, and even though many people seem to reduce it to macros and higher-order functions, that view does certainly not reflect the way people use it in reality—it’s not very attractive or particularly useful (in comparison) when reduced to that set of features.<query> what is common lisp</query> 2005, I’d think long and hard before choosing LISP over Ruby. I’d probably only do it if I needed optimized code, or macros which acted as full-fledged compilers. I’m sure Ruby is a good choice, but if you’re using Lisp just for the macros, you’ve probably missed all theinteresting features… (In case you’re curious, Practical Common Lisp is a good, freely available book that covers a lot more ground than just macros and higher-order functions) nuke edit null said about 9 hours later: You guys don’t understand…your precious little languages is a moving target.

This is a subjectnear and dear to my heart. You’re also right to call out Common Lisp’s condition system. It’s an elegant approach to exception-handling, and one that future language designers should study carefully. That said, if your Common Lisp style doesn’t rely heavily on macros, you’re missing out on half the fun, not to mention your number one sales pitch. :-) nuke edit Eric said about 11 hours later: Null, Dookus, could you please be polite? Heated arguments are perfectly OK, but please address each other with respect.<query> what is common lisp condition system</query> EH, I’ve been wrestling with the Prolog-in-Ruby problem for a few weeks now. The backtracking iseasy, and I’ve gotten a decent pattern matcher running. The right-hand side of the rules, though, is proving a little tricky. nuke edit Garrett Snider said about 13 hours later: Thanks Eric for the article and everyone else for the comments. I’ve been coming at Ruby as a long-time Java guy with a now and again interest inLISP and wandering what theLISP community thinks of Ruby. I love it as a step up from Java and I’ve been thinking that it is reasonably close toLISP, at least in power (not in language design). However, I wanted to get a deeper undestanding of the (practical) differences. Also, I’ve taken the pill that allows me to love the “arbitrary syntax” mentioned by ‘bill a’ above.<query> what is ruby ruby</query> I find it hard to convince others who have thePERL vs. Python dualing philosophies in mind and stand on the Python (/Java) side, but as a way to implement Domain Specific Languages, I think Ruby’s open syntax shines. Where I’ve had a question is on the following issue: If the additional syntax options are layered on top of a solid consistant core (like withLISP), it seems to be solid advantage, perhaps even outshining the venerableLISP in this respect. (Specifically, I’m thinking of Executable DSLs.) So commentary here regarding the fundamental soundness and consistancy of the Ruby language vsLISP is especially interesting and appreciated. nuke edit bill a said about 13 hours later: OK, guys….you can say whatever you’d like about Lisp, but please, please, please stop capitalizing it.

That was bugging me too. nuke edit Smalltalking with a Lisp said about 13 hours later: Ruby was inspired mainly by Smalltalk and Lisp. If you really want your hair blown back, check them out. Ruby and Python are gateway languages to the above. nuke edit bill a said about 14 hours later: I am curious how much of Ruby comes from Lisp. I would tend to think that people who are familiar with Lisp do not go around writing languages. :) nuke edit Unordinary Programmer said about 14 hours later: “Some may say Ruby is a bad rip-off of Lisp or Smalltalk, and I admit that. But it is nicer to ordinary people.” - Matz, LL2 nuke edit Anonymous Coward said about 16 hours later: Hmm.<query> what language is ruby based on</query> Lisp macros are far more powerful than the trivial use cases you’ve listed. I could give a lot of examples here, but just ask yourself: why is most of the programming community so fond with “Design Patterns”, while the Lisp community generally isn’t? Well, that’s because patterns are nothing but high-level specifications for code being rewritten again and again and again. The Lisp approach is to create some macros and auxiliary functions that actually implement the pattern, thus extending the language capabilities and avoiding continuous reinvention of the wheel. It has happened for object orientation (CLOS anyone?), aspect-oriented programming, OO<->SQL mapping… All without touching the basic language syntax and implementations. Ruby features may compete in some specific cases, but I bet that the same consideration would apply for other languages too.<query> what is lisp pattern</query> Finally, regarding the Lisp libraries: it’s true that the language specs are full of historical cruft (e.g. mandatory support for the now-dead versioning filesystems), and lack things like standard sockets. But it’s also true that there’s a good amount of free (as in freedom) libraries that fill the gap. Have a tour on http://cliki.net/ for an appetizer. nuke edit Beowulf said about 16 hours later: I’ve made a relatively lengthy response to the posts here on my blog. http://zifus.blogspot.com/2005/12/power-vs-popularity.html You may not agree with my reasoning, but realize this is the reasoning process I went through when I decided to build my system in Rails instead of Lisp. Realize that I love Lisp and I would have used it if I could’ve focused on solving my actual problems rather than trying to integrate various frameworks together and struggling to get it all working as a cohesive whole.<query> what is lisp used for</query> The biggest reason I abandoned Java and C# is that I wanted to focus on my problem, and not fight with getting the language and framework to do what I want. This is coming from a lover of Lisp, imagine what someone who either isn’t a fan of the language or doesn’t even know it exists is thinking. nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said about 20 hours later: Ruby’s creator is outspokenly influenced by Lisp and Smalltalk, yet Ruby’s success is supposed to be a terrible thing to Lisp users? Particularly since Smalltalk’s creator also speaks of his influence and admiration of Lisp? ;) I (perhaps badly) recall that things in motion tend to have lower friction coefficients. If Ruby’s technical advantages get the mainstream moving, great. I think this is a more reasoned article than I remember seeing from the Java and Python worlds.<query> why was ruby created</query> The transformation, in this case, could be read as “for each valuen, multiply n by two.” In JavaScript, you’d writelambda as function, which is perhaps a bit clearer: map(function (n) { return n*2 }, mylist) Of course, this is only a hint of what you can do with lambda. Languages which favor this style of programming are calledfunctional languages, because they work with functions. A dense functional language can be very concise indeed, and quite clear once you learn to read it. How does Ruby stack up against LISP for functional programming? Let’s consider Paul Graham’scanonical example, a function which creates an accumulator: (defun foo (n) (lambda (i) (incf n i))) This code is marginally shorter in Ruby, and the notation will be more familiar to C hackers: def foo(n) lambda {|i| n+=i} end acc = foo 3 acc.call(1) # --> 4 acc.call(10) # --> 14 acc.call(0) # --> 14 But there’s an interesting special case in Ruby which saves us even more typing.<query> what is lambda in ruby</query> However, I think it has two honest errors. For one thing, I wouldn’t call Common Lisp a functional language, if by that we mean it is biased towards recursion over other techniques. I use iteration heavily; Lisp’sLOOP macro is pretty impressive in this regard, and there are even more powerful 3rd party iteration constructs. Perhaps Rubists focus on functions because they correctly find a lot of power in them, but then they’re viewing Lisp through Ruby-colored glasses. Second, as for plain macros, these are just functions which (at some time like “compiletime”) take code and return code. They take a sexp and return a sexp. What’s the purpose? Usually expressiveness. Readability. Since they can use other aspects of the language like dynamic scope, they multiply the expressive power of the language.<query> what is lisp macro</query> But they must be used tastefully, as power requires justification. Since I don’t write lambdas much in the first place, my macro usage certainly ain’t to save effort typing lambda. ;) Completely orthogonal concepts. nuke edit Anonymous (again) said about 21 hours later: From Eric: That said, if your Common Lisp style doesn’t rely heavily on macros, you’re missing out on half the fun, not to mention your number one sales pitch. Ok, I agree with that; my initial response may have been a little rash :-) My point remains, though, I’d say that more of half of the fun comes from all the other parts often not mentioned. Macrosare an essential part, but just one of many. To Beowulf: It sounds to me like you are playing the bitter ex-martyr yourself (no offense intended) there.<query> why do you use macros in common lisp</query> Multiple commercial Lisp vendors are doing just fine, even though their implementations arenot cheap and even though there are various actively developed high-quality open-source implementations. That alone shows that the market exists. As David Thornley put it, “Lisp doesn’t look any deader than usual to me”, and all the people saying it the opposite won’t change that (funny, back when I used FreeBSD, “FreeBSD is dead” was the typical (periodically occuring) outcry of many not-users. I guess it’s not particular to Lisp after all). I agree that it isn’t as widely used for open-source software as many contemporary languages are, but it is used surprisingly often once you look further; in particular, the harder the problems you’re solving, the more it seems to be used. The nature of most free Lisp implementations tends to favour long-running programs (they don’t focus on small initial memory footprints or delivering small binaries), and the benefits of the language help you more the harder your problems get—abstractions scale (in dealing with the complexity of your program), syntactic shortcuts don’t.<query> why is lisp used</query> I suspect that this is also why most/many Lispers don’t care too much about getting a shorter syntax for (lambda (...) ...): It simply doesn’t win you much (in terms of shorter code size) in non-trivial programs; other factors become much, much more important. (This is also why micro-benchmarks are usually not representative unless you write fibonacci or factorial programs all day) You must occupy a niche if you will [...] No, (in my humble opinion) the whole power of Common Lisp comes exactly from the fact that itdoesn’t focus on niches. It focuses on power. If you want to occupy a niche, you can easily extend Common Lisp to do that (I think it’s called “writing your ownDSL” nowadays :-); Prolog-in-Lisp, Lisa, AllegroCache and AspectL are just a few examples of that (all implemented as normal libraries,IIRC).<query> what is the power of common lisp</query> I’m certain that Common Lisp couldn’t have survived for this long weren’t it so extensible: Perl, Python, Java, they and most other new languages all reinvent themselves every other year, and I’m sure they would have been succeeded by “competing” languages by now if they didn’t — most niches are moving targets and the competition doesn’t sleep. The Common Lispstandard, in comparison, has not changed for a long time and probably won’t (need to) anytime soon. Sure, that means that writing a simple webpage inPHP may be simpler; Perl is certainly more comfortable to use for a quick one-liner; Erlang should beat Common Lisp easily in the domain Erlang was created for, and so on. Where Common Lisp shines, however, is when your problem isnot covered by a typical niche. It shines when your problem is hard and your requirements aren’t simple, when you actually can make use of the advanced features.<query> what is common lisp</query> If another language has a library/framework that does just what you want to do, and Common Lisp doesn’t, why use Common Lisp, anyway? I think using one language for everything is usually a bad sign (lack of flexibility on part of the developer), not a good one (no language is best at everything, and I never understood people who think that. Also, life would be terribly boring if that were so). It’s simply not true that people didn’t/don’t write frameworks in Common Lisp, but I suspect that what you consider a framework is usually just called a library in Common Lisp. If you think it is dead in the commercial world, franz.com (one commercial Lisp vendor) alone has more than enough success stories/impressive products to prove that wrong (I guess Lord of the Rings (the movie), Jak and Dexter and Orbitz are typical modern examples).<query> why use common lisp</query> cliki.net / lispwire.com have plenty of links to open-source libraries/software. I’ll close with a quote from Kent Pitman: “…Please don’t assume Lisp is only useful for Animation and Graphics, AI, Bioinformatics,B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining, EDA/Semiconductor applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent Agents, Knowledge Management, MechanicalCAD , Modeling and Simulation, Natural Language, Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling, Telecom, and Web Authoring just because these are the only things they happened to list.” nuke edit Eric said about 22 hours later: Bill, the lowercase spelling “Lisp” is certainly correct for Common Lisp (and I’ve fixed it in the main article—thanks!). The uppercase spelling, however, has along and respectable history. The new way certainlyis easier on the eyes, but my LISP teachers were a bit old-school, and I haven’t overcome my nostalgia yet. :-)<query> what is lisp used for</query> As for your query about how often LISP hackers write new languages: Oddly enough, it’s abit of an obsession. Yeah, I know, it makes no sense. But H. sapiens always did tend to mess with perfection. Tayssir, I would be delighted if Ruby encouraged programmers to take a good look atLISP (and SmallTalk). And Ruby is certainly good news for metaprogramming in general. Maybe we’ll finally stop hearing about macros being “too powerful,” a personal peeve of mine. nuke edit Ben said 1 day later: Nice article. I’m not a Ruby user but I will say one language feature it has which Common Lisp doesn’t—first class continuations. Also, given the success which Python has had in porting to the CLR, has anyone seriously thought about making a Lisp-like language for .Net?<query> what language is ruby</query> I mean, there are some things out there, but they seem either not well supported or rather ML-like (which is fine but not exactly like Lisp.) nuke edit Joku said 1 day later: The article didn’t really compare how things could be done in Python, even though it started from the premise that Ruby might be more powerful. Not really a surprise though, because it would’ve turned out that Python code can be nearly identical in complexity to Ruby code (sometimes slightly more complex, sometimes slightly less). And neither Ruby nor Python come close to providing the same power as macros in Lisps. I don’t think you gave any reason to consider Ruby over Python. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Eric, Sure, many years ago “LISP” was the correct rendition, but I don’t think that’s been the case for quite some time.<query> which is better python or ruby</query> Incidentally, all of those examples you pointed out (Dylan, Scheme, Goo, Logo) are all dialects of Lisp. :-) nuke edit Anonymous Coward said 1 day later: About continuations in Lisp: here’s an example of a language extensions provided by using macros. Maybe Common Lisp doesn’t have “native” continuations because they can be created in several ways. See “On Lisp” by Paul Graham for an example (the book is downloadable from his website, if you don’t want to spend money). Maybe they are not syntactically as nice as the Scheme built-in continuations, but for practical pourposes they are just “good enough”. And more syntactic sugar is always available by using some macro magic. nuke edit First Rest said 1 day later: This article sounds like it was written for folks who really want to use Lisp, but have chosen Ruby because all the cool kids are using it and want to reasonably justify an emotional decision.<query> what is the language extension for lisp</query> Consider a (very silly) function which takes alambda as an argument: ;; Call 'fn' once for each natural number. (defun each-natural-number (fn) (loop for n from 1 do (funcall fn n))) ;; Print 1, 2, 3... (each-natural-number (lambda (n) (format t ""~D~%"" n))) Now, we could write the same function in Ruby: def each_natural_number(fn) n = 0 loop { fn.call(n += 1) } end each_natural_number(lambda {|n| puts n }) But we can do better. Let’s get rid of lambda and fn using yield: def each_natural_number n = 0 loop { yield n += 1 } end each_natural_number {|n| puts n } Yes, yield is a special-purpose hack, and yes, it only works for functions which take a singlelambda.<query> how to use lambda in ruby</query> Lisp has been around a long time and has watched other, more popular languages attempt to catch up to it. Here’s a clue: they still haven’t. Figuring that out involves a difficult learning process that challenges most of the things you have learned and involves looking at things in an entirely new way. If you want to learn a language that can change with the times and incorporate whatever latest fad the programming cool kids have to offer, Lisp is the choice. Lisp is the red pill. One question to ask one of the other commenters (who put his comments on a blog that doesn’t allow anonymous posting) that mentioned the small Lisp community: If everyone does like you did and decide to move on, how would the community ever grow? Low hanging fruit is so much easier to pick. nuke edit Lisp + Python = Lython said 1 day later: What about a sexpr-based language built on top of Python, that generates Python bytecode, can access Python libraries and even supports macros?<query> what language is lisp</query> http://lemonodor.com/archives/000648.html (Ok, it’s just a prototype, but here’s my 2c about the Ruby vs Python vs Lisp issue). nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: It’s true, Joku, that Python metaprogramming has become more common recently, using techniques very similar to those popular in the Ruby world. This is a good thing, and deserves broader notice. Guido, however, has never been much a fan of functional programming, and has stated (PDF, page 4) that he doesn’t like lambda, map, filter, reduce, and similar constructs. Normally, this isn’t a problem, because Python has slick list comprehensions: [ n*n for n in [1,2,3] if (n*n)%3!=1 ] In a lot of common cases, list comprehensions will look better than either the Ruby orLISP examples above.<query> what is python metaprogramming</query> But there’s an underlying problem: List comprehensions are a special-purpose feature, and I can’t use the same mechanisms for building myown domain languages. And since Python’s lambda is very limited, it generally won’t help much. Effectively, Python allows me to create new kinds of definitions (by hacking metaclasses), but it doesn’t allow me to define new control constructs. Normally, this doesn’t matter much, but it’s a nuisance if you’re trying to build something likeRake. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: One big difference between Lisp and Ruby is that Ruby gets its dynamicity and its metaprogramming capabilities by doing a lot of code evaluation at runtime. To people who aren’t familiar with Lisp, it might seem that this is the only way to do it. So for instance in Lisp, I might write a macro to define part of a domain-specific language.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> That macro is then expanded into other code at compile-time, and that’s all there is to it. Ruby, on the other hand, takes a much more runtime-centric approach; instead of transforming code, I just have to make sure that a given block is evaluated in a context where the methods it calls can be accessed. So Ruby can’t make many assumptions about code it reads until that code is actually running. The two approaches have advantages and disadvantages, but I (of course ;-) find Lisp’s approach cleaner. It means that the compiler can warn about calling undefined functions, and that development environments can easily do things like locate code definitions. With Ruby’s approach, in general the semantics of any given snippet of code can only be determined at runtime. To be sure, Lisp does have an eval function, but it doesn’t get used much at all outside of Lisp itself.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> This is a good thing. When I was using Ruby, I was sometimes frustrated about this situation – that all decisions about code are made at the last possible minute. Of course, this lets you do things like method_missing and so on, but I have yet to miss that (no pun intended) since switching to Lisp. I don’t mean to suggest that everything in Lisp must be statically prepared (as in C or Java), only that in general Lisp takes a different approach to dynamicity. Just another point to keep in mind. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Sweet! Lython’s definitely a slick hack, and—judging from the sample code—the author noticed that Python’s bytecode is actually moreLISP-like than its official syntax. Python’s if statement really is an expression; the parser just refuses to nest it.<query> what is lisp used for</query> In general, thePython Language Services are a pretty promising framework for implementing a macro system; somebody just needs to roll up their sleeves and make it happen. Bill, you’re absolutely right about LISP and compile-time versus runtime performance. Exhibit A: Ruby on Rails takes a couple of seconds to launch a new server process. With a good compiler,LISP could do the same thing as fast as the OS could read pages into memory. The long-term trends probably favor the LISP (or even Scheme) approach, mostly for reasons ofIDE support and better compile-time checking. The Ruby approach is actually dangerous if your team doesn’t maintain unit tests. nuke edit Beowulf said 1 day later: First Rest, I enabled anonymous comments, I didn’t realize you had to turn that on. :(<query> what is lisp framework</query> I agree with you that Low hanging fruit is easier to pick, which was exactly why I chose Rails for my system. That doesn’t mean I’ve moved on though, rather it means for this system at this time, I didn’t feel like Lisp was the right choice. As someone else mentioned, increasing popularity of Ruby is a good thing for Lisp. Anything that gets people looking at languages more powerful than the Java/C/C++ paradigm is a good thing for Lisp. Eric, my point wasn’t that Lisp should become a niche language. Although in most people’s mind Lisp alreadyis a niche language, it’s the AI language to them. I was suggesting that Lisp needs to find a new place to occupy in people’s minds in order to increase in popularity. The best way to do that imho is to create a shiny new object (ala Rails) for people to play with and promote the heck out of it.<query> why is lisp a niche language</query> Lol, nice retort with the bitter ex-martyr. It made me laugh if nothing else. :-p. I’ve followed and have been involved in numerous Lisp is better than language “x” discussions. Everyone that I have seen devolves into the all too familiar battle of syntax. I just think that people won’t switch languages because the solution to summing children is better in Lisp. I think that misses the point entirely. People are after real world, tangible benefits. Little 3 and 5 line snippets of code simply do not show the actual power and expressiveness of Lisp. Most people cannot extrapolate a 3 line snippet into a real system. I think there is great news that Rails is what is driving adoption of Ruby. It serves to illustrate that people can and will pick up a new language, even an obscure one with relatively wonky syntax.<query> why is lisp better than ruby</query> nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Beowulf, I don’t think I ever said the solution to summing children was a reason to switch to Lisp. I was countering Eric’s assertion that Ruby is more “functional” and “functionally dense” than Lisp. Of course it “misses the point entirely” if that’s how you’re going to interpret it. Real-word, tangible benefits? OK, here you are: - macros give you the power to increase the readablility, concision, and correctness of code. Consider theLOOP and ITERATE macros. Common patterns of looping are expressed withamazing simplicity simply because LOOP and ITERATE can perform code transformations. For instance, let’s say you want to loop over the elements in a sequence and return the one with the highest absolute value: (iter (for x in seq) (finding x maximizing (abs x))) I think that’s fancy.<query> what is the benefit of using a macro in ruby</query> And when you consider that the ITER form is going to expand into wicked-fast code at compile-time (and then be compiled to machine code, in someLISP implementations), you realize that you’ve just gotten a powerful abstraction and increased readabilityfor free . No runtime efficiency or spacecompletely is wasted with this construct, becauseITERATE has efficient idioms to transform common looping patterns into damn fast code. Directly using the faster code would mean a huge loss in readability and maintainability – with Lisp macros, I don’t have to worry about it. For the curious, the macroexpansion for thatITER form is at the bottom of this common. For more macros, take a look at Peter Seibel’s book Practical Common Lisp ( available free at http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book). In one of the final chapters he builds a binary file parsing system that’s plain amazing – and he does it with macros.<query> what is the purpose of a lisp macro</query> But in heavily functional code,yield buys us a lot. Compare: [1,2,3].map {|n| n*n }.reject {|n| n%3==1 } (remove-if (lambda (n) (= (mod n 3) 1)) (mapcar (lambda (n) (* n n)) '(1 2 3))) In a large program, the difference adds up. (In LISP’s defense, it’s possible to write a reader macro which makeslambda more concise. But this is rarely done.) Ruby gives you about 80% of what you want from macros At this point, the LISP hackers are saying, “A good syntax for lambda is nice, but what about macros?” And this is a good question. LISP macros are functions that: Run in the compiler, and Transform custom syntax into raw LISP.<query> what is lambda in ruby</query> Earlier in the book, he writes a test framework in something like 26 lines – using macros too. Here is a sample of the code used to parseID3 tags in MP3’s: (define-tagged-binary-class id3-tag () ((identifier (iso-8859-1-string :length 3)) (major-version u1) (revision u1) (flags u1) (size id3-tag-size)) (:dispatch (ecase major-version (2 'id3v2.2-tag) (3 'id3v2.3-tag)))) It specifices the types and order of the data to be read from the file, and then passes control to another binary-class based on the value of major-version – and even automatically throws an error if the major-version is invalid.<query> what is id3 tag</query> - interactive development. If you haven’t used this, you’re missing out. Most languages are about writing lines of code, feeding them to either an interpreter or a compiler, and then watching what happens. In Lisp, development is always done live and interactively. You write functions in files and then send them to a Lisp image. You develop each component of your system one by one and test it live. There is no compile-run-debug cycle – there isn’t even an interpret-debug cycle. It’s more like a write-test cycle. Interactive development also means you have access to your running system. Not sure what parameters a fucntion takes? Start typing “(func ” and the Lisp environment will remind you what arguments can legally follow that. Want information on an object you’re playing with?<query> what is lisp interactive development</query> Type “(inspect x)” and an interactive, recursive inspector will let you walk through it, even making changes as you go. Once you get your program working, you refactor a little, do some benchmarks, take advantage of Lisp’s completely optional type system to speed up bottlenecks, and sit back and admire your work. - the condition/restart system. In most languages, there is not much that can be done after an exception is raised. Log it, send it to the user, end the program. In Lisp, an error can berestarted. For instance, in the UncommonWeb framework, when you browse to aURL and an error is signaled, you get the backtrace in your environment. You can now make changes to your code, recompile it, and then invoke theRESTART-REQUEST restart. UCW starts processing your request from the beginning, and the browser gets the result of running your latest, changed code.<query> what is the lisp method for restarting a program</query> - regular syntax. In Lisp, all forms can be broken down into (operator [args]). There is nothing else. This means that I can write macros, but it also means that editors can do really neat things with code, because Lisp is regular. I can move up, down, forward, backward, into, and out of lists with Emacs keychords. This might be difficult to appreciate until you’ve tried it, but I really recommend it. Refactoring code becomes trivial when you can treat control structures as a single entity and cut and paste them. - almost 50 years of use and development. Lisp has survived longer than every language exceptFORTRAN. It survived C, C++, Ada, COBOL, and it will survive Java and Ruby. It is, to borrow Paul Graham’s term, “the hundred-year language.” - more!<query> what is lisp used for</query> All of this said, I ought to admit that I do use Ruby and Rails in all of my professional projects. This is not because I don’t think Lisp is ready, but simply because I hadn’t learned Lisp when I started these projects. I now regret that, and my next web application will be in Lisp. As promised, here is the crazy but efficient expansion of the ITERATE form above: (LET* ((#:LIST6 NIL) (X NIL) (#:TEMP7 NIL) (#:RESULT5 NIL) (#:MAX8 NIL) (#:FIRST-TIME9 T)) (BLOCK NIL (TAGBODY (SETQ #:LIST6 SEQ) LOOP-TOP-NIL (IF (ATOM #:LIST6) (GO LOOP-END-NIL)) (SETQ X (CAR #:LIST6))<query> what is the lisp extension</query> (SETQ #:LIST6 (CDR #:LIST6)) (SETQ #:TEMP7 (SQRT X)) (COND (#:FIRST-TIME9 (SETQ #:FIRST-TIME9 NIL) (SETQ #:MAX8 #:TEMP7) (SETQ #:RESULT5 X)) (T (COND ([snipped to prevent overflow -ed.]) (T #:RESULT5)))) (GO LOOP-TOP-NIL) LOOP-END-NIL) #:RESULT5)) - Bill (who is heartily enjoying this discussion) nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Ruby is more than just a dynamic or scripting language. But feel free to snob it. More “Rails-like” projects are on the way. nuke edit First Rest said 1 day later: Lisp lets YOU be Gosling or Matz or Guido.<query> what is ruby used for</query> If you want to extend the language, it’s possible: “DOLIST is similar to Perl’s foreach or Python’s for. Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the “enhanced” for loop in Java 1.5, as part ofJSR-201. Notice what a difference macros make. A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern. A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language. Then Sun has to publish aJSR and convene an industry-wide “expert group” to hash everything out. That process—according to Sun—takes an average of 18 months. After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature. And even once the Java programmer’s favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can’t use the new feature until they’re allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java.<query> what is the difference between java and lisp</query> So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.” —Peter Siebel from Practial Common Lisp nuke edit Garrett said 1 day later: Thanks Bill. That’s very helpful stuff. nuke edit null said 1 day later: Some things not mentioned: meta-object protocol; sexpr (code is data, data is code); for commercial lisps, amazing IDEs. Schemes also have advantages: smaller language – philosophy is move the rest of code to libraries; free near-C fast compilers (Bigloo) (free Schemes have better IDEs than Lisp); possibility prototype algorithms with call/cc and finally translating to efficient iterative algorithms in imperative languages (like C). A final example: look at the 2 open source Computer Algebra Systems written in Common Lisp available as Open Source: 1) Axiom – originally fromIBM Thomas Watson Research Center; 2) Maxima – originally Department of Energy (US).<query> what is the advantage of common lisp</query> This is software written in the 70s. You can’t write software that lasts so long with a language that is a moving target. This is the kind of survival and complex domain which shows the power of Lisp. All these scripting languages are really about people experimenting with language syntax. This is nice, but look at it for what it is. Additionally, almost none of those languages have any theory attached to them. Lisp has (lambda calculus), Smalltalk has (Actors), ML has (type theory). This garantees good, lasting design. Take a look at Perl6 for an example of extreme design experiment. Where it’s going, nobody knows, but – hey! – they’re using Haskell in the implementation (I always thought Perl people were smart). Lisp was very expensive and demanding of hardware in the 70s and 80s.<query> what language is lisp</query> This is not so anymore. There is no great shiny free LispIDE (yet), but at least one vendor sells a good one for a relatively good price. Surely, this can’t keep people from using lisp, since people have taken to relatively “rough” stuff like Perl. By the way, there’s a great Perl book called Higher Order Perl that is really about learning a lot of techniques from Lisp and applying to Perl. I bet a lot of them could be applied to Ruby. All these scripting languages do is create a problem and sell you a solution. But to be fair, scripting languages empowered programmers like Lisp had not (“batteries included”, etc). I think the problem with Common Lisp and Smalltalk is the size of the stuff you have to learn, syntax-wise.<query> what scripting language is used for ruby</query> The most common use of LISP macros is to avoid typing lambda quite so much: (defmacro with-each-natural-number (n expr) `(each-natural-number (lambda (,n) ,expr))) (with-each-natural-number n (format t ""~D~%"" n)) defmacro defines a function that takes a list as an argument, and returns another list. In this example, our macro is called every time the compiler seeswith-each-natural-number. It uses LISP’s “backquote” syntax to quickly construct a list from a template, filling inn and expr. The list is then passed back to the compiler. Of course, this macro would be useless in Ruby, because it’s working around a problem we don’t have. The second most common use of LISP macros is to create mini-languages for defining stuff: ;; Generate some bindings to our database ;; using a hypothetical ""LISP on Rails."" (defmodel <order> () (belongs-to <customer>) (has-many <item> :dependent?<query> what is lisp macro</query> Some jobs that required scripting languages in the 90s required learning something fast (everything is more complex nowadays – but at least you’ve got frameworks). Also, Perl, Python, etc, were very portable. Syntax-wise, however, I think the approach taken by Scheme and Eiffel are more sensible (there are reasons for the size of Common Lisp as well as Smalltalk – but I believe it is an impediment). Who knows, maybe people will try Lisp because of Ruby. I bet more people will get frustrated than contribute back. Also try Scheme. It’s a different philosophy and gets even less press than Common Lisp, but it’s worth it. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Boy I wish there was a comment editing facility here. More typos: “the bottom of this comment” – not “the bottom of this common” an extra “completely” in “no extra space or time is wasted” “even allowing you to make changes’ instead of “making changes as you go” Also, a clearer version of the iterate example would be: (iter (for x in '(-1 2 -10 4))<query> which is better scheme or eiffel</query> (finding x maximizing (abs x))) ;; => -10 Sorry, guys. I guess these don’t make too much difference, but hopefully this comment will clear up some confusion. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: null, that’s good advice but those not familiar with Scheme should remember that Common Lisp and Scheme are very different languages. The superficial similarities in their syntax don’t make that obvious, and so some people perceive them as pretty much interchangeable. I personally do not care for Scheme, and yet Common Lisp is by far my favorite language. So if you’ve had exposure to Scheme and didn’t like it, don’t dismiss Common Lisp out of hand (and vice-versa, too). I agree that it does take a lot of work and mind-warping to “get” Lisp and I also agree that that’s probably helped to hold it back.<query> what is the difference between scheme and common lisp</query> I think Peter Seibel’s book Practical Common Lisp (I cannot recommend this book strongly enough!) goes a long way to resolving that. nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: You remember what the Japanese car companies did to GM? :-) Big, powerful, shiny, etc, aren’t enough to match simplicity and hardwork. Lisp people ignore 90% of the Ruby features. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Sigh. Johnny, have you even read the discussion? Do you know what’s being discussed, or are you just making emotionally-driven, knee-jerk reactions because the superiority of your favorite language is being called into quexstion? Lisp people are aware of all of Ruby’s features because many of them come from Lisp. No one here is attacking Ruby (at least I’m not).<query> what language is ruby</query> The point of the discussion is simply that Lisp is awesome. Ruby’s geography has nothing to do with its properties as a language, and many of the concepts in Lisp are actually, believe it or not, much simpler than Ruby’s. It’s really not intelligent to make claims about the Lisp community, especially when you quite plainly don’t know Lisp. Also, what exactly is wrong with being a “dynamic language”? You use the term as if it were an insult. What is Ruby if not a dynamic language? nuke edit Beowulf said 1 day later: Bill, that was a very well written comment. One definite pain point for me has been the lack of macros. There is enough similarity in my comment and scoring system in different areas that I really have wanted a better method for abstraction.<query> what is ruby if not a dynamic language</query> Rails has the concept of Partials and Components, which can be used to abstract your design, however they also carry a pretty significant performance overhead. That overhead has forced me to abandon them on some pages because they simply were to slow with good abstractions in place. Several good macros on the other hand would have allowed me an elegant level of abstraction without that same type of performance hit. Practical Common Lisp (PCL) is definitely an important book for Lisp. It took me a long time to find a good book to learn Lisp from (this was prior to the release ofPCL), and I finally had to go back to Lisp by Winston and Horn. A book written in 80’s which is no longer in print. InPCL there is finally a well written introduction to Lisp that is relevant to solving the problems of the Internet age.<query> what is practical common lisp</query> I honestly hope Lisp gets an upsurge in popularity. Things seem to be moving more and more in the direction of power and expressiveness. It just appears to be happening at a relatively glacial pace. Lisp clearly has the power to stay the course though. As Eric mentioned in the original article though, Ruby really is a good next choice. Paul Graham once said if you can’t use Lisp, use Python. I’ve used Python for a long time now, and I definitely prefer Ruby to Python at this point. As a language it is much closer to Lisp than Python, and it’s OO syntax ismuch cleaner. That being said, it’s not a bad thing to know all three (Lisp, Ruby, and Python). nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Johnny, Bill, please keep it polite.<query> what language is better lisp or ruby</query> We’re having a good discussion here, and I don’t want totake away anyone’s vowels. :-) Bill’s point is excellent, and deserves elaboration. I can easily translate his code to Ruby: class Array def find_maximizing result, f_result = nil, nil each do |x| f_x = yield x if f_result.nil? || f_x > f_result result, f_result = x, f_x end end result end end [1,2,-3].find_maximizing {|x| x.abs } But my code is going to run much slower than Bill’s, because the iter macro lives in the compiler. The same goes for the IDv3 parser: It would look fine in Ruby, but get absolutely clobbered on performance. A year from now, this could actually be a pretty good sales pitch for Common Lisp. “It’s like Ruby, but it runs at full hardware speed!” nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Bill, you are one of the few who claim to be proficient at both, Ruby and Lisp.<query> what is the difference between ruby and common lisp</query> The problem is that the features that you or other people are going to use in Lisp are just a subset of the features that Ruby is used for. For example, Ruby is very suitable for shell programming, instead of Bash, Sed, Awk, Perl, etc. I just recently started using Rake, and it’s a really awesome tool to use for shell programming. RubyC, mkmf.rb, setup.rb, etc, really make it easy to create extensions for Ruby that bind to external libraries. I don’t think people enjoy creating bindings for Lisp as much as people do in Ruby. So, if all you want to do is to create WebApps in Lisp, fine. But that use is just a subset of what Ruby is normally used for. I know that Lisp is quite powerful as I said that myself. I know it’s used for tons of different things.<query> what is lisp used for</query> But WebApps really are what most people seem to be doing these days. Though with Ruby you can use it for more than just Web site handling. So, when I claim people don’t know most Ruby features, it’s just because they are spread among many use-cases, libraries, etc, just like in Lisp. Code RESTful in Ruby! nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Null wrote: I think the problem with Common Lisp and Smalltalk is the size of the stuff you have to learn, syntax-wise. I’ve taught Scheme to a lot of non-programmers over the years. The syntax is problematic, but only until they find a good editor. (Emacs, sadly, doesn’t work for many non-programmers.) The other big impediment is usuallyLET, which introduces too much nesting for some folks.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> The larger obstacle is learning to think in LISP (or SmallTalk, or Haskell, or any other powerful language). Bill can post a dozen excellent macros, and most people will say, “Huh?” Until you know how to use it, it’s just a weird feature. It’s actually easier to sell a language by solving small problems (my web apps are ugly!) than by proposing profound new features. Ruby gets in the door because (1) Rails is slick, and (2) the syntax doesn’t looktoo odd. And once people have played with ActiveRecord for a while, they begin to understand why metaprogramming is cool. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Johnny, even though few people write Makefiles or shell scripts in Lisp, it’scertainly possible. Lisp is basically a toolkit for building programs like Rake.<query> why is lisp used</query> t)) Using Ruby on Rails, we could write: class Order < ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :customer has_many :items, :dependent => true end Here, belongs_to is a class function. When called, it adds a bunch of member functions toOrder. The implementation is pretty ugly, but the interface is excellent. The real test of any macro-like functionality is how often it gets used to build mini-languages. And Ruby scores well here: In addition to Rails, there’sRake (for writing Makefiles), Needle (for connecting components), OptionParser (for parsing command-line options), DL (for talking to C APIs), and countless others. Ruby programmers writeeverything in Ruby. Of course, there’s lots of advanced LISP macros which can’t be easily ported to Ruby.<query> what is the function belongs_to in ruby</query> So why don’t you see more great Lisp frameworks? Mostly because (until very recently) the Lisp community was small, fragmented, and didn’t have anything likeCPAN or RubyGems. Most of the Good Tricks™ had been written down only once or twice, and the books had gone out of print. Fortunately, a lot of the missing pieces have appeared in the last five years, and many of the rest will be along soon. nuke edit timsuth said 1 day later: Eric: “def find_maximizing” Ruby 1.9 has “max_by”. [1, 2, -3].max_by { |x| x.abs } nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: OK, here’s another example of ITERATE that I hope showcases a little more of macros’ sweetness: (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 -4 -10 -43 49 49 8934)) (until (= (sqrt 7) x))<query> what is max_by in ruby</query> (collect x into collection) (finding x maximizing (abs x) into y) (finally (return (list collection y)))) ;; ((1 2 3 -4 -10 -43) -43) This is a lot more complicated than the other example, and still not really useful, but I hope it illustrates howITERATE provides a whole sublanguage for expressing any kind of iteration you can think of. I’d also like to point out that ITERATE can be extended with user-defined macros. For instance, I’ve written a macro calledAVERAGING that works withITERATE: (defmacro averaging (var) ""Add a clause to ITERATE to average the value of VAR."" (with-unique-names (count total) `(progn (summing ,var :into ,total) (counting ,var :into ,count) (finally (return (/ ,total ,count)))))) (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 4 5))<query> how to iterate macro</query> (averaging x)) ;; => 3 There’s more Lisping going on here, and some of this probably looks pretty esoteric (incidentally, this example also shows off Lisp’s docstrings – that string after the defmacro line will be associated with AVERAGING as its documentation, so I can run (describe ‘averaging) and get that string at runtime). But notice that I’m working with an extensible sublanguage for expressing the most common concepts in iteration. The examples Eric and timsuth gave could be defined in any language with first-class functions, but no language but Lisp could define a custom mini-construct like this. Note also that even thoughITERATE provides new coding constructs, I still have full access to Lisp within: (iter (for x initially 0 then (1+ x)) (if (evenp x) (print x)) (when (= x 10) (return x))) In this (contrived) example, everything except the first line is straight Lisp.<query> what is the lisp example</query> This sort of thing isn’t possible in Ruby. Here’s another example: (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line)) This will collect every line in file “foobaz” into a list. (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line at beginning)) will collect the lines in reverse by adding each to the beginning of the result instead of the end. (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line at beginning result-type 'vector)) will collect the lines into a vector instead of a list. And so on and so on, ad infinitum (or nauseam, since my comments are starting to get repetitive).<query> what is the ruby example for a list</query> The point is that the authors ofITERATE have built a mini-language that is: 1) able to capture the most common iteration constructs, even relatively complex ones, like maximizing a function and collecting items based on some condition 2) user-extensible 3) written in Lisp and not part of the Common Lisp language itself – that is, you or I could sit down and writeITERATE and no one would know it wasn’t part of the language 4) fast, and yet still high-level There is much more to macros than just ITERATE, but I think ITEREATE is such a good example of the kind of power that regular syntax and macros can give you. And keep in mind that all this ends up as fast, tight machine code. And if it still isn’t fast enough, throw in some type declarations and optimization settings: (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 4 5)) (declare (type fixnum x)) (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (compilation-speed 0)))<query> what is iterate</query> (averaging x)) I hope that these comments are useful to people who are curious about Lisp. I wish I’d known about some of these things many years ago. All code untested. - Bill P.S. While I appreciate Eric’s request that we keep it civil here, Johnny, saying that Lisp only has asubset of Ruby’s features is outrageous. It is quite, quite the opposite. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: OK, since I’ve spent the majority of my day commenting here, it is time to go do some other things, but I would like to also call attention to the fact that those optimizations in the last example are local only to the block that contains them – I think that’s pretty damn cool. And just one more example of macros. AllegroCache is a commercial database for Lisp that lets you make queries in Prolog.<query> what is lisp macro</query> DISCLAIMER: I do not know Prolog very well, and I remember the examples I’ve seen very vaguely, so this may not be exactly and completely accurate, but it gives you a rough idea: (<-- (parent ?x ? y) (db person ?x children ? c) (member ? y ? c)) (<-- (grandparent ?x ? y) (parent ?x ? z) (parent ? z ? y)) Here, the <—macro indicates that the following forms will be in prolog. What we’ve done here is define parent and grandparent relations using Prolog. So we declare roughly how the two relate to each other, and then we can make queries on the database with these. So say I have a variable x with myself in it. I can then run the Prolog query macro, ?-, like so: (?-<query> what is the parent and grandparent relationship in prolog</query> (parent me ?x)) and AllegroCache will return the name of anyone in the database who has me as a member of their children list. I could do the same with grandparents. Folks, I think this is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. Again, these are macros, so all the prolog gets reduced to Lisp code at compile-time, but really have you ever seen anything this cool? Can you picture the hideousness of theSQL that would do this? Lisp owns. OK, for real, there are many more things in life than the RandomHacks weblog, and I must go and attend to them. Hope I’ve made a difference. nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Alright, Bill. Sorry about my “car” analogy. Sorry for pretending that Lisp users use a subset of what’s normally available for Ruby.<query> what is the coolest thing lisp can do</query> It’s just that the world is too polite sometimes. If you use an “obscure” language and nobody talks about it, you are guilty of not spreading the world. If you use an “obscure” language and people talk about it, you are guilty of “hyping” it. It seems that we can only “hype” it if we present a revolutionary tool like Rails. Fine. Maybe in the future we will have some more of that. Till then, see you. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Nope, there will be one more comment. First of all, the Prolog clauses do not actually expand into any serious code – they expand into calls to AllegroProlog functions and a little bit of bookkeeping. My bad. I think I gave the impression that they directly become code that is equivalent to the Prolog.<query> what is prolog clause</query> nuke edit JAP said 1 day later: I could start this comment with LOL, because the proposed statement is showing so perfectly the real deep misunderstanding of many of us regarding Lisp: So let me shortly explain my point of view: The real reason that brought me to Lisp (and never will get me away from it) is simply this: You can build it out of 7 (s-e-v-e-n) primitive operators! And, as a consequence, no other language can be expressed in itself as short as Lisp. (As you probably know, quite any language can be expressed in itself.) So let me repeat: really no other language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) can be built out of less primitive operators.<query> what is the purpose of lisp</query> In particular, macros which actuallycompile mini-languages haven’t appeared yet, although they might be possible with enough work. (Ryan Davis has done some promising work in this direction with ParseTree and RubyInline, and I’ll be writing about related techniques as I discover them.) Ruby’s libraries, community, and momentum are good So if LISP is still more powerful than Ruby, why not use LISP? The typical objections to programming in LISP are: There aren’t enough libraries. We can’t hire LISP programmers. LISP has gone nowhere in the past 20 years. These aren’t overwhelming objections, but they’re certainly worth considering. Once upon a time, Common Lisp’s standard library was considered huge. But today, it seems painfully tiny. Java’s manuals fill a wall, and Perl’s CPAN archive has a module for anything you can imagine.<query> why use lisp</query> All the other features of Lisp are only natural consequences of the above. Because McCarthy did not “create” Lisp (as any other language designer does), he did “discover” it!! (If you read this sentence for the first time, please read it another 2 times). So the real point is: no other language can be more simple and more flexible than Lisp at the same time. BASTA! JAP (just another Paul [not Graham]) P.S. For the philosophers of us: we are all together very difficult, and really have a hard time to become more simple for the rest of our lifes ;-) nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: One last comment: maybe “Lisp is the most algorithmic language”. nuke edit Haskell Junkie said 1 day later: Well, macros are fine and dandy, but don’t let the lisp diehards lead you astray.<query> what language is the most algorithmic</query> Learning the Haskell language will show you how to do all theDSL and other tricks using just higher order functions. After putting about 3 months effort into learning Haskell, you’ll probably come to see most macro usages as unnecessary hacks. I’d even bet that someone’s already done monads in Ruby. Interesting examples to get you motivated include parser combinators and backtracking. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Bill, if you’re interested in combining Prolog with a Lisp dialect, I’ve heard thatThe Reasoned Schemer is an excellent introduction to logical programming in Scheme. Haskell Junkie, thank you for the links to the parser and backtracking papers. Haskell is often unrepresented in these discussions, which is too bad, because it’s a powerful and unique language. And yes, somebody is working on monads in Ruby. Once again, a big thank you to everyone for having kept this discussion friendly.<query> what language is haskell</query> Good manners make iteasier to have heated, passionate arguments about important stuff. :-) nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Eric, I’ve got PAIP here when I finally get around to learning Prolog in Lisp. I was mostly just impressed that it could be used to make complex queries on a database. Haskell Junkie, can you give some examples? nuke edit SB said 1 day later: “So let me repeat: really no other language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) can be built out of less primitive operators.” Except Forth. Or Factor. Or Joy. Let’s not be ignorant here :) nuke edit Ralph said 1 day later: As a humble current user of PHP and MySQL – but having been around sinceFORTRAN and Assembler and happy IBM 1620 Machine Language days – I want to say that I am enjoying the discussion here.<query> what language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) In a way it sounds like a conversation among chess players, or artists. The “coolness” of a language, its elegance, its expressive power, are all important to language designers. I have constructed a few little languages, one of which even went into production in a small way. Recursive descent compiler, byte code interpreter, multi-threading at the application level. I understand the basics. But most of us, even those of us who do love elegance, nevertheless gravitate toward whatever language environment seems to get the job done with the least total effort. That means common operations must be expressed as easy-to-read idioms. If you consider the spoken form of natural language for a moment, I think you will find that it is essentially all made out of idiom. In writing, I can express something like, “The ship did not contain any containers containing containers, but it did contain several containers containing parts used to construct containers”—and here I use a bit of abstraction, made possible by a few minor regularities in the English language.<query> what is the idiom of language</query> No one who has been reading this thread is likely to have had any trouble immediately understanding what I just wrote. But in spoken language, it is quite difficult to express the above both clearly and concisely. Even people frequenting this forum might not be able to express or understand that thought quickly in spoken language unless something of the context had been pre-established. The reason for that, I think, is that there is probably no established idiom for even such a very slightly complex thought. If such thoughts had to be expressed with any frequency, an idiom of some kind would immediately and “spontaneously” arise. Then the above sentence would become trivial to express and to understand. Syntactic sugar provides idioms for commonly performed actions. Obviously, then, it must also reduce generality. Idiom is supposed to reduce generality.<query> what is the difference between idiom and idiom</query> “Admitting,” then, that one uses Perl, or even (gasp!) PHP, is like admitting that one uses ordinary spoken English. But we all do that. So, I’m eagerly awaiting Lisp on Rails, and all sorts of other great stuff, plus a hosting company that lets me write my web pages in that great stuff. Please. Use some of that “hard problem solving” ability to get it all accomplished, and I will be thrilled to be your very first customer. My current provider gets about $20 from me each month, depending on disk space and network bandwidth used. I am not trying to be facetious, much less rude. I am trying to raise a serious point, even though I did end on a rather familiar, even caustic note, for which I apologize if it jangled anyone’s nerves.<query> how much does perl cost per month</query> nuke edit Jules said 1 day later: This is a really good discussion! I’m a Ruby programmer, but I want to take a look at lisp. It looks good and I like its simplicity (based on only a few principles). I want to learn lisp because I enjoy programming. Am I right that there are 2 main lisps: Common Lisp and Scheme? Which one should I learn, what are the main differences? nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Jules, I would learn Common Lisp, but I’m biased :-). I linked to Practical Common Lisp earlier on. Take a look through the online chapters and see if you like it. That’s a pretty good way to get started. There’s also Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is a free book fromMIT and a classic in computer science.<query> what is the difference between lisp and scheme</query> You can pick up Scheme from it, but you’ll also get a deeper understanding of how Lisp-like languages work. There is a third Lisp in common use: Emacs Lisp. There are allegedly more lines of Emacs Lisp in use than Scheme and Common Lisp combined. Still, I don’t think I would recommend starting with Emacs Lisp, since it’s sort of quirky and sort of crippled. Anyway, happy lisping! nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Well, let me try to explain the differences between Common Lisp and Scheme, and other people can clarify—and fix my sweeping stereotypes. :-) Scheme is a very clean dialect of Lisp, with an emphasis on functional programming (see part one, above). One of the most popular implementations isPLT Scheme, which is often used with How to Design Programs.<query> what is scheme lisp</query> Common Lisp, on the other hand, tends to have better compilers and commercial support. Common Lisp’s culture embraces a diverse range of programming styles: functional, object-oriented, and imperative styles are all common, as are macros (see part two, above). Common Lisp also has more historical cruft than Scheme. Looking upthread, people seem to likePractical Common Lisp. You can download Common Lisp installers from the same site. Cultural and implementation differences aside, Common Lisp and Scheme are pretty much interchangable. You can always find a macro package which addsLisp features to Scheme, or vice versa. Either would be an excellent choice, and both are relevant to Ruby. nuke edit nemesis said 1 day later: Smalltalking with a Lisp: “Ruby was inspired mainly by Smalltalk and Lisp” Don’t forget Perl!<query> what is the difference between lisp and scheme</query> Ruby is very perlish… nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said 1 day later: Ralph, well, the tech.coop offers Lisp web hosting, and one of the guys there is working on something he humorously calls “Lisp on Lines.” (LoL.) Though I haven’t heard that it’s ready for common use yet. But keep in mind that I don’t “advocate” Lisp. At this moment, you will find barriers to entry. And while I think Common Lisp is a highly powerful tool, you need to take Lisp advocates’ words with a grain of salt. They’re good at explaining the advantages of Lisp, but many do not take care to discuss its current downsides. (Like the ones this blog entry discusses.) Therefore they may mislead. Now, most advocates mislead, but I like to hold CL people to a higher standard.<query> what is lisp on lines</query> Common Lisp, in comparison, doesn’t even have standard way to talk to the network. Similarly, LISP programmers are scarce. If you’re around Boston, there’s a small pool of grizzled hackers who can very nearly work magic. Elsewhere, there’s a thin scattering of curious young hackers. But LISP has always been a minority language. Ruby, on the other hand, is growing rapidly in popularity. The big driver seems to be Rails, and the ramp-up started in late 2004. If you’re trying to launch a company, it’s more-or-less acliché that every potential employee is a Rails nut. Rails will soon trickle back into ordinary web consulting, and from there–eventually–into big business. Ruby has also been around long enough to develop a good standard library, and alarge archive of add-on libraries.<query> what language is ruby</query> ;) nuke edit SB said 1 day later: nemesis: Ruby used to be Perlish, but nobody uses the blatant Perlisms ($_ etc.) anymore… nuke edit Jamie said 1 day later: “But my code is going to run much slower than Bill’s, because the iter macro lives in the compiler. The same goes for the IDv3 parser: It would look fine in Ruby, but get absolutely clobbered on performance. A year from now, this could actually be a pretty good sales pitch for Common Lisp. “It’s like Ruby, but it runs at full hardware speed!” That is not really an argument for or against either language. It is just saying that Ruby currently lacks a decent compiler. That was true of Lisp, once, and it won’t be true of Ruby, one day.<query> what language is perlish</query> One day Ruby will have a better compiler than Lisp if it stays popular enough to motivate a good commercial compiler to be written. Most of the arguments in favour of Lisp here seem to be around it’s macro facilities. Yet, any reasonably regular language can have similar facilities – especially if there is defined a normal form which all syntactic sugar reduces. And even better, if the sugar can be used in macro patterns as well as regular code. The point about Lisp being built out of 7 primitives isn’t really an accurate comparison. Ruby is also only built from a few primitives, if you process the syntactic sugar – which is just the same as using a Lisp reader macro – and in both cases there are a plethora of extra features which you can treat as being built from macro extensions and additional I/O primitives.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> I’m looking at all the Lisp examples in this discussion, and I’m seeing the Ruby examples also presented here, and (if you ignore execution time, as that is just compiler maturity), they look roughly equivalent in capabilities, just presented with different sugar – and more sugar with fewer parens in Ruby’s case. —Jamie (who doesn’t use Lisp much and has never used Ruby, but does know what compilers can do) nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Bill, I’m just Haskell newbie, but I’ll take a stab at your question. You can find a lot of Haskell examples inA Gentle Introduction to Haskell, and I’ve had good luck with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. From a Lisp perspective, you’ll notice two things: (1) Haskell variables, once set, can never be changed, and (2) because Haskell uses lazy evaluation, you can easily represent infinite data structures.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Lazy evaluation allows you to do all sorts of cool things. You can represent iteration and data traversal in stunningly gorgeous ways. (In effect, everthing’s a co-routine.) You can also, if you’re so inclined, define an infinite list of all primes. Now, these features are very cool, but they come at a high price: Since you can’t assign to Haskell variables, you have to writeeverything in a purely functional style. Even I/O can be challenging, because it changes the outside world. So how do you write real programs in Haskell? As it turns out, Haskell has a second powerful trick: monads. Monads are pretty esoteric, but in Lisp terms, you might think of them as a way to metaprogramcontrol flow. The most common Haskell monad is IO , which makes Haskell statements execute sequentially, so you can talk to the outside world.<query> what is the most powerful haskell variable</query> Other monads implement assignment, list comprehensions, continuations, and domain-specific languages (like the parser combinators above). Haskell can be a challenging language—some common programming idioms can only be expressed with monads, which are at least as hard as macros—but, like Prolog, Haskell makes certain programs look gorgeous. And of course, there’s no reason why you couldn’t apply many Haskell ideas in Lisp, if that’s what you want. If you’ve mastered macros, and you’re looking for cool programming styles, Haskell’s not a bad place to start. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Jamie, these features of Lisp have nothing to do with the maturity of Lisp’s compiler. Instead, they have everything to do with Lisp’s regular syntax. It is indeed criminal that Ruby doesn’t even have a bytecode compiler, but this is not really the issue here.<query> what is haskell monad</query> The code in Ruby is much more than “syntactic sugar.” It is a complete formal language that has to be translated into anAST (abstract sy before being used. The following Ruby code: if foo.bar? and bar.baz? puts foo.to_s end does not simply expand into other code – it requires a full and complete Ruby parser to be transformed into anything useful. If you still don’t believe me, consider the fact that there can be aribitrary expressions in the if’s test, and that Ruby (like Lisp) treats if’s as expressions, and allows them to be used anywhere. I could write this: if foo.bar? and bar.baz? and (89 44 54.0444).abs \== 4 and (if x == 4; 56; nil) do_this end There is no “syntactic sugar” that will simply and straightforwardly translate that into anAST.<query> what is ruby code</query> Lisp’s syntactic sugar, which I guess you aren’t personally familiar with, is completely different. An example is the #’foo reader macro, which simply expands into (function ‘foo). Or the ‘foo macro, which expands into (quote foo). Lisp reader macros are merely shortcuts for other Lisp forms. They are syntactic sugar in the strictest sense, and do little more than very straightforward code transformations. As I hope my examples have made clear, this is pretty different from a language with syntax. I think the phrase “built out of 7 primitives” is misleading (although I think a poster higher up the thread was the first to use it). A better term would bedescribed in 7 primitives. There is code over at paulgraham.com that implements a full Lisp evaluator using only those seven operators.<query> what is lisp reader macro</query> The whole thing is about a printed page long. So the only point that can be made is that Lisp’s semantics can be completely explained with seven primitives. Which is still a cool thing, but not the same as what was being claimed. To build a language you still need a function to take strings and turn them into lists, and other handy things like I/O support and so on. (incidentally, here is Paul Graham’s code: http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.lisp). If you can point me to Ruby code equivalent to Paul Graham’s, I will concede the argument. But you won’t, and you can’t, because that isn’t how Ruby works. Ruby has a syntax, and Ruby needs a full parser to get from that syntax to anAST. Because Lisp code is naturally an AST, things are very different. Also, it’s true that if Ruby could be transformed into a more regular language you could write macros with it.<query> what is lisp language</query> This is, in fact, probably possible with Ryan Davis’s ParseTree package. But now your macros have to output (and work from) an intermediate format, instead of straight Ruby code. That intermediate format will be some kind ofAST and the mapping between real Ruby and that intermediate form will almost certainly be a hassle to manage, so why not ditch the syntax and use Lisp’s model, where all code is naturally and automatically anAST, and macros simply follow from that? nuke edit Haskell Junkie said 2 days later: bill, Here’s an example of a simple arithmetic parser and evaluator using theParsec library. And below is a little snippet of a non-deterministic program in action. Say you want find a pair of numbers which multiply out to 8633. Well, this isn’t the most efficient way to do it, but it looks nice and declarative… -- try combinations of factors between 2 and 100 and cull the wrong ones import Control.<query> what is the parsec library used for</query> Monad main = print ( do a <- [ 2..100] b <- [ 2..100] if a*b == 8633 then return (a,b) else mzero ) ...nothing new there, something that could also be done in lisp without macros (especially if your lisp comes with an “amb” operator). But it is nice to note that thelist monad which makes this work is implemented in 7 lines of code. nuke edit bdw said 2 days later: Well, I’ve considered the same thing, really. Ruby isn’t a ‘lisp’ because it is a denser functional language. Ruby isn’t really a functional language;LISP is. Ruby would have been a ‘new LISP’ (in the same way that ‘yellow is the new black’)if it would have been just a little more consistent.<query> what is monad in ruby</query>"
clueweb12-1503wb-33-01954,9,1,"What Is Desktop Linux Missing? Posted by Jon on June 12, 2006 The comments on my previous post about desktop Linux have gotten me thinking about what exactly desktop Linux needs in order to succeed. From where I sit, the big factors are: No Linux Distribution is built and marketed around the desktop . Sure, some distributions, such as SUSE Linux 10.1 OSS pretend to be, but in reality, they are still built around a set of philosophic principles that most end-users do not care about. If you want desktop converts, you are going to have to shut up about “restrictive software license” as an explanation why MP3s, Flash, PDFs, RealPlayer and Windows Media files do not work. The DVD Playback issue is not settled. Honestly, how do expect your average Joe to use your product when watching a movie on his laptop could make him a felon?<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I don’t know how this will shake out; either the ‘Betamax Defense’ will work, or some new tactic will have to be thought up, but I really believe that this one is a show-stopper. Drivers, Drivers, Drivers. If you are going to tout your product as a desktop replacement for Windows, then you are going to have to have as many driver options as Windows. No one wants to muck around with drivers just to get their network card working so that they can go read about what other hacks they need to get the rest of their hardware running. Excuses about not having access to specs from hardware vendors just don’t cut it here. If it doesn’t have drivers, and tons of them, and it can’t automatically detect and install more than 95% of the hardware out there, it isn’t a desktop operating system.<query> what is the difference between windows and betamax</query> Take a hint from Apple. No one is selling desktop Linux correctly. I don’t know what these folks have been smoking, but last time I looked, the large majority of people didn’t give a crap about freedom, cost-savings, or security update frequency when it came to theirOS. All people care about is whether or not their computer comes with everything they need to turn it on and start playing on the web and emailing their friends. Everything else is lagniappe. If you can’t sell it as an easier way to get stuff done, or you can’t get Dell to sell it preinstalled on their machines, you won’t sell it. There are probably other issues that I haven’t addressed, but from here, those are the biggies. Linux has a serious image problem – half of the desktopOS users don’t know what it is at all, and the other half think of it as too technical or “for experts and hackers”, regardless of whether or not they have ever used it.<query> why don't dell computers sell linux</query> Linux pundits have long talked about the technical merits of Linux, so much so that most people think of Linux as not being something they are capable of using, and as with most lifestyle and work-related options,better the devil you know than the devil you don’t. Posted under Pondering and tagged withDesktop Linux Comments (5) 5 Responses to What Is Desktop Linux Missing? June 15 2006 Shawn You have some good points, but I’m not sure I agree with all of them. The drivers, andDVD issues are no brainers. But the Take a Hint From Apple section got me thinking… Sure, it’d be nice to install anOS and never have to tweak it to work. But that just is not reality for most of theDIY computers – regardless of platform. I have to jump through hoops with Win2K/XP to get my Gigabit NIC working, I have to download comercial drivers for my Nvidia card.<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I have to update my sound drivers. All this will happen wether I’m running Windows or Linux (I have no experience with Macs, so can’t comment). The only way around the problem is if the hardware manufacture installs the OS for you – preinstalled operating systems, like you see on store bought laptops and desktops. Or like Apple, who controls both the hardware AND software. So, as long as you have those who want to do it themselves (the DIY boxes), you will ALWAYS have installation issues. Simply because of the odd hardware combinations, and/or cutting edge hardware where the manufacturer only creates drivers for one version of anOS. My Thoughts. June 23 2006 Jon Shawn, I agree that any DIY computing project is going to have hardware/software conflicts,but I don’t agree that, by extension, Linux on the desktop can be excused from having those problems.<query> why do i always have to update my sound driver</query> Linux on the desktop is not about DIY projects. It is about the 80-90% of computers that come from the store with anOS loaded that is never changed. Desktop Linux is about Joe and Jane Average using Linux on a day-to-day basis. The fact that I have an laptop with SUSE running KDE on it has nothing to do with Linux on the desktop, because no one can go to Circuit City and buy that product.

BUSTER: First, TSA doesn't have a watch list. TSA is a customer of theTerrorist Screening Center, a component of the FBI that is responsible for maintaining the consolidated terrorist watch list. The center has said publicly that there are less than 400,000 individuals on the overall consolidated watch list, 95 percent of whom are not U.S. persons and the vast majority of whom are not even in the U.S. TSA uses two subsets of this list, the no-fly and selectee lists. These small subsets of the overall list are reserved for known or suspected terrorists that reach a threshold where they should not be allowed to fly, or should get additional scrutiny.<query> how many people are on the tsa watch list</query> nearly half the initial name matches proved worthless.? And the TSC?s slow response time means that innocent travelers who happen to find themselves caught in that margin of error would have to wait months to have problems addressed. The problems with the watch list show that the Privacy Act is as necessary now as ever. Citizens must have an enforceable right to access data collected about them, and to correct that data. And if watch lists are going to be compiled, the TSC needs to have reliable systems in place to assure accuracy and completeness of information.

Bob, DHS is one of the worst abusers of ""classified"" information, often overclassifying information so it doesn't have to be shared. So pardon me if ""classified"" or SSI doesn't necessarily fly with me. As I work in the government industry, I know about sensitive and classified information. I also know that there's a lot of unclassified information out there too tagged FOUO (or its equivalent, SSI). As a representative of the government, sharing such information WOULD be an official use. I don't think anyone's arguing that TRULY sensitive information shouldn't be shared.

I see TSA continues to publish and endorse the following myth: The 9/11 hijackings made it clear that those safety precautions did not keep the pilots in control of the plane. What makes air travel particularly dangerous is that all law-abiding passengers and crew have been disarmed. It's clear that when passengers realize the deadly goals of hijackers, they have the courage to attack the hijackers, with their bare hands if necessary.<query> why was the 9/11 hijacking a myth</query> But we would all be safer if the honest passengers had weapons as good or better than the weapons smuggled aboard by hijackers. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even with today's security screening, many honest people accidentally bring weapons onto airplanes, and are not detected. If honest people can do it, so can hijackers -- and unlike the honest people, they'll use their weapon to seize the plane. The 9/11 hijackings were not successful because the hijackers were able to smuggle some kind of weapon on board. They succeeded because they knew the crews were forbidden to resist a hijacking. Before 9/11, a hijacker could successfully take control of an aircraft with nothing more than a ball point pen. TSA would have a lot more credibility if it stopped lying to the American public.

The long-expected thing for CBGB: I wrote a good bit of this, then realized that it wasn't quite what you wanted, and purged the whole thing to redo it. I had been making a list of all the SSI-acceptable things that TSA has policies on but never actually released a press statement about, and what you had actually wanted what differences between public statement and actual policy. Yay for paying attention to details. Anyway, I'm fairly certain this all passes SSI muster, since it's just more or less an up-to-date version of the TSA Traveler's Guide from the TSA website, with everything edited to be, uh... what's the word?Accurate.<query> what is tsa policy on ssi</query> July 14, 2008 4:44 PM Wintermute said... The TSA seems to be operating on security through obscurity with a little security theater thrown in to fool the masses. Security through obscurity doesn't work. Period. The list can be probe. If Mr. Terrorist's cousin can fly with no hassle because he's not on the no-fly or selectee list, then Mr. Terrorist knows of one name not on the list, and that's all Mr. Terrorist needs. Because of family ties, Mr. Terrorist probably looks enough like his cousin to use his ID. Mr. Terrorist is trained as well as a BDO and believes in what he's doing, so Mr. BDO doesn't notice anything suspicious, and neither does Mr. TSO. Mr. Terrorist is now on the plane. But wait! Mr. TSO did his job, and screened Mr. Terrorist well.<query> who is mr terrorist cousin</query> Yes. Some things were clarified, too. This list is considerably shorter than what I had been writing before, and is just about as exciting (read: not) once you get into it. Most of it's probably actually already known about anyway, but you wanted it, so here it is. And it's in no particular order, either, I just plopped it here when I found it. Ahem: 3-1-1 for carry-ons = 3 ounce bottle or less (by volume) ; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger placed in screening bin. One-quart bag per person limits the total liquid volume each traveler can bring. 3 oz. container size is a security measure. Most of that is true enough, except for the well-known fact that it'sactually 3.4oz (or 100ml) instead of 3oz.<query> what is the volume limit for carry on</query> Originally itwas just 3oz, and then that changed in, like, a week or so to bring it in line with our Eruopean friends, because 3oz was some weird number in mL for them. Scissors - metal with pointed tips and blades shorter than four inches It might be a trivial thing that most people can figure out on their own, but the measurement starts from the point of the fulcrum, not from the point where the blade actually begins. Since this isn't an issue on most scissors, though, most people aren't likely to care. :D Realistic Replicas of Firearms This is one that gives people all sorts of fits. Some would describe a realistic replica as being, y'know, black and metal and has an action that moves properly and such, like an AirSoft™ gun.<query> what is the measurement of a scissors</query> Others, though, take a far more stricter view of this - I've once seen a report of acapgun being stopped on grounds of being a realistic replica, and its owner charged by local law enforcement because of it. Oh, yeah, it wasbright orange plastic with a canary-yellow handle, and the 'revolver' part didn't revolve at all. How, exactly, that qualified as a 'realistic replica' I'll never know. Expect much in the way of uneven enforcement onthat one. Gel shoe inserts - Gel shoe inserts are not permitted, but shoes constructed with gel heels are allowed and must be removed and screened. This is another one that often gets maligned by the public, and rightfully so because of how it's worded. Specifically, they mean gel inserts for shoes.<query> are gel shoes allowed</query> Like, it's a plastic bag in the shape of a foot that slides into your shoe, and if you squeeze it or fold it, you can literally see the gelatinous interior flowing around the bends and your fingers and stuff. Common sense, incoming: The common Dr. Shoal's™ stuff at Wal-Mart doesn't count, given that it's soft, molded plastic, and not an actual ""gel."" If you are asked to undergo a personal screening you will be provided a screener of the same gender except in extraordinary circumstances. In some cases you may have to wait for a screener of your gender to conduct the screening. You will be advised if the wait will be more than a few minutes. And, in some cases, it doesn't happen. Period. At Huntsville, for example, we have a 'no cross-gender screening' rule.<query> can you have a personal screening at walmart</query> None whatsoever. Period, done, finito. Of course, that could also just qualify as a local policy and might not mesh with what you had asked in particular, but it's one of those... hm... delicate situations that most of the airpots have their own way of handling. I've... pretty much ripped apart the TSA website now, and most of the rest of it looks like it's fairly well in working order. There are a couple of other things that might have gotten past me, though. Other things, like why the TSA never put out a blurb about passengers now having unlimited passes through the WTMD after just years and years of only having two passes (and, even older, just a single pass), or why they never made a statement about the revising of the travel document stuff (which people still don't want to believe me on~).<query> can i have unlimited tsa passes</query> So, so many problems the TSA has in terms of public relations would be over in aflash if they just made a couple of updates to the stated policy to reflect what's actually accurate. I mean, I know it isn't TSA's strong suit, but I'm not talking about every single little regulation -- I'm specifically talking about making an attempt at it for the big mama chicken subjects like the TDC stuff. I know I made you wait a couple weeks for that one, CGBG, and I apologize for it; did I at least come close to what you wanted? It helps to be a little more specific, otherwise I get easily distracted and go off on tangents. :D July 21, 2008 6:33 PM Anonymous said...

In the midst of a discussion of the infamous 2004 soldier-with-jaw-wired-shut and wire cutters incident, HsvTso Dean said in passing: Why the supervisor didn't step in and allow them based on a legitimate medical purpose, I don't know. See, here's a dilemma that I don't know how to resolve. Do we want to allow exceptions to the SOP or not? If you grant TSOs (or supervisors) the ability to grant exceptions to the SOPs, you create problems with inconsistencies, which many (including me) have criticized loudly here. (""But they let me take this on the plane at [insert airport] ... why can't I take it on here?"") But if you don't allow for exceptions, you end up with embarrassing situations like this.<query> why can't a supervisor grant exceptions to a sop</query> I don't know TSA's SOP, much less the culture under which TSOs and supervisors operate. But I'm guessing that either (a) supervisors are not given the authority to override the SOP in any situation, or (b) supervisors have the authority, but are discouraged from using it, verbally or non-verbally. [Anyone who works for TSA want to confirm or deny? Dean?] That discouragement can be awfully subtle, of course. It's always ""safer"" to follow the rules; no-one up the chain will fault you for following the SOPs precisely, while you are subject to discipline if you waive the rules and someone up-the-line disagrees with your judgment call. (Notice that the TSOs involved in the nipple-piercing incident were backed 100% by TSA because they followed the rules ... even though it was obvious that the rules were inadequate in that very unusual situation.) And so, with supervisors unable, or unwilling, to override the procedures, you get to obvious ridiculous incidents ... like the wire-cutter-and-jaw incident, the nipple-piercing incident, or the pilot-and-catering-knife incident.<query> why do supervisors have authority to override the rules</query> So I don't know how to resolve that. I want consistency, so I know what to expect when I approach a checkpoint. But I also want TSOs to be able to exercise their best judgment in my favor when it's obviously in everyone's best interest, and doesn't compromise security. It is easy in any organization to lose track of the purpose of the organization. TSA's goal is to make airline travel safer, not to enforce rules & regulations. Now enforcing rules & regulations may be a perfectly legitimate mechanism to achieve the goal of safer travel ... but the rules are a means to an end, not the end themselves. I suspect that TSA struggles with this issue just like any business. So ... I'm rambling.

[Anyone who works for TSA want to confirm or deny? Dean?] It's... actually... kind of a mix of the two. There are situations where even supervisors do not have the authority to override the SOP. Specifically, when the SOP very clearly, in black and white, states ""thismust not happen"" or ""the screener must do this."" And then there are other situations where the Supervisors have that authority.<query> who has authority to override tsa sop</query> Kip Hawley wrote, in an internal memo, that the SOP is not Holy Writ, and that we will not be struck dead by lightning from the sky for not adhering to it rigidly. It wasn't written for all circumstances and scenarios, he said, and one's best judgment should take the day. This was about a month or so ago, in 2008. Back in 2004, it was a slightly different atmosphere, where there was an actual ""You may not deviate whatsoever from these guidelines"" clause in the SOP. Most Supervisors, however, aren't going to exempt a passenger from the SOP for anything less than extraordinary or compelling reasoning. To do otherwise would probably make upper management turn an eye at the Supervisor and start some kind of investigation or another. Just as a for-example, not wanting your digital camera x-rayed because it might erase the memory isnot one of the reasons to be exempted - our SOP states quite plainly that digital camerasmust be x-rayed, and it doesn't matter how much you want to argue about it.<query> why is a passenger exempt from the sop</query> Film cameras, however, are a different beast altogether. Me, myself, I would have considered the wirecutters that the soldier had to be a pretty extraordinary and compelling circumstance to grant him the exemption, even without having the need to summon over the Supervisor. Though, technically, in 2004, I wouldn't have had that authority. July 23, 2008 9:10 PM Jim Huggins said...

Individuals on the no-fly and selectee lists are identified by law enforcement and intelligence partners as legitimate threats to transportation requiring either additional screening or prohibition from boarding an aircraft. MYTH: The ACLU's math estimates that there will be 1 million people on government watch lists this July. BUSTER: Assumptions about the list are just plain wrong. While a September 2007 report may have said that there are 700,000 records on the terrorist watch list and it was growing by an average of 20,000 per month, that is not the same as the number of individuals on the watch lists. A new ""record"" is created for every alias, date-of-birth, passport and other identifying information for watch listed suspects.<query> how many people are on the us government watch list</query> Why are the reported 10 people per day who decline to show ID considered so likely to be a threat to air travel security that TSA restricted their right to travel by refusing to allow them past TSA's airport checkpoints? 6. How does the cost of this new policy of invasive interrogations at government checkpoints in airports compare to that of to the previous policy of thoroughly screening anyone who did not show ID regardless of his reasoning? 7. TSA cites 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107 and 1540.105(a)(2) as the law giving them authority to demand identification as a condition of granting access to a sterile area of an airport .49 C.F.R § 1540.5 appears to limit such passenger screenings to searches for weapons, explosives, and incendiaries as the only requirement for granting access to the sterile area.

This would be a real, low cost, security measure that does not bother most people, except for a few small details: 1. The list is ways too big. 400,000 individuals on the consolidated terrorist watch list is way too much, and makes it impossible not to have name confusions. Remember, the list sources are so crazy they included even Nobel prize winner 90-year-old Nelson Mandela. 2. The watch lists are checked by airlines, who then give people their boarding pass (marked SSSS if you match the list) and let the person roam freely around until they voluntarily go through security, which does not check the list. 3. I am one of the watch list victims. My name cannot possibly be confused with anyone else (long complicated eastern European name).<query> why do we need watch lists</query> I know I am not remotely related to any terrorist activity.

Who are these people whose names are on the DHS blacklists? Apparently, they're not dangerous enough to charge with a crime, or we would do so rather than simply hassling them at airports before letting them travel or turning them away. If they are outside the United States, then of what use is this list in restricting access todomestic flights? If they are inside the United States, why are we restricting their liberties without anydue process of law? If they are so dangerous that we must restrict their movement, should we not arrest them and then let a judge or jury determine whether they should be imprisoned or placed under house arrest?<query> why is the dhs blacklist used</query> It is not the duty of the TSA or any other part of the Executive Branch to judge guilt and impose punishment. Those are reserved for the Judicial Branch. However, that is precisely what the TSA is doing. Those people whose names are on government blacklists are punished without ever having a trial, without any chance to face their accuser, and with no chance defend themselves.

I think part of what really makes people upset about these lists is the extreme secrecy. When you are on one of these, it feels like you have been accused of some crime, or at least misbehavior, but you have no idea what you did and no way to truly clear your name. In late 2006, I found myself on one of these lists or a partial match for some name on one of these lists -- I'll never know exactly what happened, of course. The first time I was unable to check in normally and had to wait in a 45-minute line so that a ""special"" ticketing agent could glance at my license and ask my birthdate, I had no idea what was going on.<query> why are people on no fly lists upset</query> The second time, I was given slightly more information and told to use my middle name on my tickets to avoid matching (no idea if that actually helps or not). It was some 8 months and several flights later that I finally heard about DHS TRIP -- and not from any one of the airline agents that I asked for help, but from Bruce Schneier's blog. I filled out the DHS TRIP form, and later received a letter saying, essentially, ""If anything needed to be changed, it was changed,"" and giving instructions on how to appeal this (lack of) decision. For all I knew, they decided I was a problem, and I wouldn't be allowed to fly next time -- with no advance notice, of course. I went back and forth on what to do, and finally decided I should try to appeal.<query> how to appeal dhs trip</query> I called up to ask about it, and the agent asked me to read the first paragraph of the letter I was sent. It turned out this was the letter they send to people who were cleared. I haven't had problems since, but I have no idea if that is a coincidence or not, since I now make sure that I always sign up for frequent flier programs so they have my full name and birthdate (which seemed to help before I signed up for DHS TRIP, though that could be a coincidence too, of course). This whole time was rather stressful. I travel a lot for work, and if I was suddenly unable to fly, I was probably going to have to relocate or quit my job. Of course, now I'm pretty sure that was never a real possiblity, but I didn't know that at the time.<query> can i travel without a passport</query> No one would tell me anything -- even though apparently I wasn't the person they were looking for. I understand there is some need for secrecy, but I don't understand the need to keep people in the dark about their status and how to correct it. July 14, 2008 9:50 PM CBGB said...

People on here say things about security theater and security through obscurity well its really neither...theres more science in a divining rod than in your security procedures.<query> why do we need an apology</query> The reason they don't justify anything is because they put maybe 20 minutes of thought into 90% of the things they do.

Of course not, but that is what the TSA is doing with the list. Don't you think you would get a better reception is you get out of spin mode and go into truth mode for a change? Try explaining that airline tickets are purchased without any descriptors except for a name. The last time I bought tickets they did not ask my weight, age, height or even sex.

There are two issues I have here: 1) There is still no means to stop a terrorist with a fake ID (or even a 'real' ID obtained using fraudulent documentation) from bypassing your ""no fly"" list. 2) Many of the terrorists you're looking for aren't likely to appear on any ""list"" maintained by anyone, providing this false sense of security. New terrorists are trained all the time, and suicide bombers, for example, aren't terrorists yet until they plot an attack.

If anyone is that dangerous and you know it, they should not be walking around free."" I generally agree, though I'll add that it's not the Executive Branch's place to say who should walk around free and who should not -- that's for the Judicial Branch. Following are some very relevant questions and answers fromGilmore v. Ashcroft -- FAA ID challenge FAQ: Q. Isn't an ID check needed to stop known terrorists from flying? If we knew who the terrorists were, we could just arrest them all, rather than stopping them when they try to fly. So what do you mean by ""a known terrorist""? A previously convicted hijacker?<query> why is a faa id check necessary</query> A card-carrying member of Al-Queda? A Green Party member, who seeks to change our established form of government? Someone on probation, convicted of non-violent civil disobedience for protesting the Star Wars program at Vandenberg Air Force Base? A member of Earth First!? There is good reason to believe that any list of ""known terrorists"" contains ""suspected"" terrorists, not actual terrorists, and is full of errors besides. Particularly when the list is secret and neither the press nor the public can examine it for errors or political biases. ""Johnnie Thomas"" was on the watch list because a 28-year-old ""FBI Most Wanted"" man, Christian Michael Longo, used that name as an alias. But Longo was arrested two days after joining the ""Most Wanted"" list for murdering his family.<query> who is on the most wanted list</query> After he had been in custody for months, 70-year-old black grandma ""Johnnie Thomas"" gets stopped every time she tries to fly. Her story is in the May 2002 issue of New Yorker magazine. It's not clear why an ordinary criminal like Longo was on the list in the first place -- nor why he wasn't removed from the list when he was captured two days later. What is clear is that this secret watch-list is poorly controlled and ripe for abuse. And, of course, there is no guarantee that an actual terrorist would be carrying their real ID. There are many ways to deter terrorism, but checking IDs against a watch list is not one of them. It is an exercise in futility that provides a false sense of security. Q. So then how should we figure out who is a terrorist?<query> who is on the watch list of terrorists</query> Copied and Pasted from EFF.org, originally posted October, 2007: EFF Comments on Terror Watch List Since 2003, the government has been building, testing and using the Terrorist Screening Database, stitching together several disparate terrorist lists from various agencies into one vast, centralized database that is a single consolidated watch list of suspicious individuals. Information in the TSDB can be used to decide whether individuals will be allowed to enter the country, get on an airplane, become citizens, or if they will be detained at routine traffic stops. It?s a central factor in other programs, like Secure Flight, the Transportation Security Administration?s proposed plan to ?screen? millions of travelers. This week, EFF filed comments on some proposed changes to the Terrorist Screening Records System, which includes the watch list as well as other records. EFF urged the FBI to reconsider its 2005 decision to exempt the TSRS from crucial Privacy Act requirements, which makes it impossible for citizens to use the courts to access or challenge false or inaccurate data that may have found its way into the system.<query> what is the tsdb used for</query> It's a good question, that goes to the heart of the post-9/11 civil liberties issues. Who is a terrorist? Any IRA member from the last twenty years? A member of the Irgun (led by former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin)? Nelson Mandela, imprisoned for sabotage for 27 years by the South African government? A WTO protester? The US Government killed more Afghani civilians in the last year than the number of US people killed on 9/11; does that make US soldiers terrorists? Israel and Palestine both claim that the other is terrorist. So do India and Pakistan. So do leftists and rightists in Colombia. Ultimately the line between ""terrorist"" and ""freedom fighter"" is a political one. Our freedom to travel should not depend on a politician's decision about whether they agree with our aims or not.<query> who is a terrorist</query> Every ""anti-terrorist"" measure restricts people based on their politics, not just based on whether they use violence. Violence was already illegal. In other words, any list of ""terrorists"" will inevitably contain many individuals that have never committed a terrorist act, and not contain many individuals that have actually committed a terrorist act. Q. Won't elimating ID checks make air travel more dangerous? No. First, air travel is far less dangerous than driving a car or riding a bicycle. This includes the danger from terrorist incidents as well as the much more common mechanical problems and human errors. A car is dangerous because it's a heavy mass of metal moving at high speeds compared to what is nearby. The energy in that motion can easily crush humans (either inside or outside the car), or other objects like trees, buildings, or cars.<query> why is it dangerous to travel by plane</query> Safely using a car requires the application of good human judgment every second. Whenever that judgment is missing (unconscious driver) or poor (intoxicated, enraged, or suicidal), then a car is a danger to those in and around it. An airplane is dangerous because it's a ""car"" with much more mass, much higher speeds, the ability to move in three dimensions instead of two, and carrying a much greater load of high-energy material (gasoline). Commercial air travel has been safer than car travel only because of rigorous professionalism, having co-pilots always ready to take over, and safety precautions far exceeding those of amateur-operated cars. The 9/11 hijackings made it clear that those safety precautions did not keep the pilots in control of the plane. What makes air travel particularly dangerous is that all law-abiding passengers and crew have been disarmed.<query> why is air travel safer than car travel</query> It's clear that when passengers realize the deadly goals of hijackers, they have the courage to attack the hijackers, with their bare hands if necessary. But we would all be safer if the honest passengers had weapons as good or better than the weapons smuggled aboard by hijackers. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even with today's security screening, many honest people accidentally bring weapons onto airplanes, and are not detected. If honest people can do it, so can hijackers -- and unlike the honest people, they'll use their weapon to seize the plane. My philosophy is to ""educate and then trust the general public"". This philosophy is in line with the basic values of democracies. The government's approach to homeland security is ""keep everything secret and trust nobody"". This is in line with the basic values of authoritarian governments.<query> why do honest people bring weapons onto airplanes</query> I completely agree. July 17, 2008 8:27 PM Bob Eucher said...

I fully support CREWPASS, the program that will validate pilot's credentials to streamline security screening for the professionals who already are in control of their airplanes and already have access to the flight deck.<query> what is crewpass</query> This program will use a secure database already in use for cockpit jumpseaters, preventing the use of fraudulent documentation, due to the fact the pilot's photo and employment status is looked up in the computer in real time and checked against the person presenting the ID; the system does NOT solely rely on the documents presented by the individual. This verification system is already in use and this shouldn't cost any more money to implement for access to the secure area. CREWPASS will also allow TSA to focus more resources on screening those who pose an actual threat while shortening the lines for everybody. July 18, 2008 4:58 AM Anonymous said... We want to know: 1. How many people have to manually check in per day because of name similarities with the watch list? 2.

Give us these numbers and we can decide if the lists are appropriate or not. At the moment, considering the number of persons who we know having trouble with the lists, they seem too long.

That's probably not far off the mark, if you do the math -- 300 million Americans divided by 1 million named on the list (I trust the ACLU before the TSA any day, thanks -- the ACLU doesn't make a habit of lying to me).

""According to the Congress' investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office, terror watch lists have, ""helped combat terrorism"" and ""enhanced U.S. counterterrorism effort."" Why lists work for law enforcement and investigative agencies is that they have actual suspects and cases that they are investigating.<query> how many people are denied flights</query> (In place of Privacy Act provisions, the FBI substitutes its own complaint system ? which follows no timelines and has no independent oversight or accountability.) False and inaccurate data is a well-documented problem for the TSRS. For instance, in 2005, the Department of Justice?s own inspector general found that the watch list had major data accuracy flaws. And last month, the DOJ?s IG again issued a damning assessment of the system, finding that it had a substantial error rate, suffered from incomplete and inaccurate information, and noting that the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which runs the list, was slow to respond to citizen complaints. In a sample of 105 records, 38 percent were found to have inconsistencies and inaccurate information. Even more disturbing is the fact that, as the Washington Post notes, ?<query> what is the problem with the tsc</query> The lists help add threads and avenues to real investigations. If you've detained someone, and find their alias on the list, it really can help you figure out who you've caught. As a dragnet applied to the general public, using the list is a horrible idea because of the false positives. The cost of the ""misidentified"" become a larger problem than the benefits of using it. But whether or not the TSA will keep using it is answered by the CYA posture in: ""The simple truth is that it would be negligent to not use this information to our advantage."" -- whether or not it is effective, or truly a damaging waste of time, TSA must continue to use the watch lists because they would be perceived as negligent if they did not. With that reasoning, maybe TSA should hire some psychics and palmreaders.<query> why do tsa use watch lists</query> It would be negligent to not take advantage of all sources of ""information"", no matter how improbable or unreliable.

Due to some 4th Amendment challenge some years back, some court somewhere (sue me; I'm too lazy to look crap up right now) ruled that when someone walks through the WTMD or has their bag x-rayed, they have given implied consent for the searches, such as bag checks and hand-wanding and such.<query> are the podiums at huntsville airport still there</query> As a result, pretty much since the beginning of TSA, the de-facto start of the official ""screening area"" is the WTMD/X-Ray (which is why, most commonly, you'll find these two devices standing more or less side-by-side).

To determine if that six-week sweet spot would hold true for international routes, I asked the company to analyze fares for several trips, like a summer vacation to Europe and a winter escape in the Caribbean. Not only did the six-week period fail to stand up, but the findings indicate that the window for booking the cheapest ticket for these trips has increased over the past three years; in some cases it’s up to 24 weeks. “Consumers have been getting the best prices a bit further out year over year,” said Chuck Thackston, managing director of data and analytics at the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> how far in advance do you buy a flight</query> (1) the top social networks (1) thedrum (1) top mobile phone manufacturer (1) top social networks (1) Tracking (3) traffic data (1) TV (2) tv and apps (1) tw (1) twelpforce (1) Twitter (32) Twitter and TV (1) twitter business (1) twitter for business (1) Twitter Guides (9) twitter latest (1) twitter management (1) twitter marketing (1) Twitter Security Issues (2) twitter stats (1) user (1) user interface (1) Videos (1) viral (1) Virgin (1) web design (1) webdesign (1) website design (2) website guide (1) website landing pages (1) websites (1) Widgets (1) XBOX (2) Xbox Live (1) zynga (1) Text Widget Pages Home Contact Us Labels #RiotCleanUp (1) 2011 Social Business (9) 2011 social media (2) 2012 community management (1) 2012 olympics (1) 2012 reports (1) 2012 social media (2) 2012 tools (1) 4s (1) 900 million (1) Ad Networks (1) adobe (3) Adobe Flash (1) Advertising (5) Adverts (3) Agencies (3) airtime (1) Analytics (6) android (1) Apple (5) apple.<query> what is twitter</query> Sure, it’s possible that if travelers pull back on spending, airlines will be forced to cut prices, allowing travelers to nab a cheap summer flight to, say, Barcelona, as little as three weeks out. “If they don’t see bookings materialize the way they’d like, they will put the route on sale,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst. But Mr. Harteveldt and other travel watchers agree that booking well in advance is a safe bet. So far this year, airlines have raised rates three times, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of Farecompare.com, which tracks ticket prices. “I think pricing is going to be crazy,” particularly this summer, he said. So if you place stock in historical trends, the message is clear: act now. For guidance, here are the booking windows during which passengers paid the lowest price for flights to popular vacation destinations last year, based on data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> when do airlines raise prices</query> Europe in Summer LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 21 TO 22 WEEKS IN ADVANCE You may already be too late to score a cheap flight to Europe this summer. The booking window for the cheapest tickets has moved further out, from 11 or 12 weeks in advance in 2009 to 21 or 22 weeks in 2011. (Average round-trip fares rose to about $1,500 last year from $1,100 in 2009; this year’s outlook is no better.) To boost your savings, take the least expensive route to Europe you can find. Then concentrate on getting to your ultimate stop cheaply. “I look into the cheapest fare into a hub like Berlin,” said George Hobica, founder ofAirfarewatchdog.com, which scours the Web for bargains. “Then I figure it out from there.” He said this may involve taking the train or flying a budget carrier like easyJet or Ryanair to the final destination.<query> how far in advance to book a flight to europe</query> Spanish airports like Madrid tend to be cheaper than London or Paris, he said. Dublin and Shannon also tend to be cheaper jumping-off points. Whatever you do, don’t wait until the last minute. Last year, average fares for tickets purchased less than a week before travel were about $2,600, almost double the price of those bought at least 28 days in advance. And if you’re visiting London during the Olympic Games, July 27 through Aug. 12, expect to pay a premium. Caribbean in Winter LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 11 OR 12 WEEKS In 2009 and 2010, the cheapest airfares went to procrastinators who purchased tickets just two weeks in advance at a saving of about 8 percent. But last year, the pattern took a sudden shift, with the cheapest tickets bought much further ahead. “Certainly you’ll want to start shopping plenty early to get a gauge on pricing,” said Mr. Seaney of FareCompare, who recommended hunting for airfare as early as three months in advance, especially for hot spots like Costa Rica and out-of-the-way islands, which lack the airline competition that tends to keep prices in check.<query> how far in advance should you book flights</query> Business or First Class to Asia or Europe LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 23 TO 24 WEEKS While the majority of premium travel is purchased by business travelers booking within six weeks of departure, leisure travelers with the flexibility to buy well in advance have been able to find bargains. Travelers paid about $3,113, or about 20 percent less than average, when buying premium tickets to Asia or Europe 23 or 24 weeks ahead last year. A good time to take advantage of low business-class rates is during peak vacation times like summer or the winter holidays. While coach class quickly fills up with leisure travelers, the cushy seats at the front of the plane can be empty. Rather than give those seats away as upgrades, airlines often try to fill them with sales, according to Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the travel Web site JoeSentMe.com, which alerts members to such sales.<query> when is the best time to buy airline tickets</query> For travel to Europe in summer, for example, “it looks like all gateways and all destinations between the United States and Europe are on sale,” he stated in a recent newsletter, with round-trip business class prices as low as $2,327 from Newark to Brusselsand $2,359 from New York to Frankfurt, if booked by May 31. But, he warned, “Fares seem to be higher in August than in July, and there are some days when prices soar above $4,000 round trip from the East Coast.” General Tips Beyond historical trends, there are also some useful online tools that can help you evaluate fares. For example, Bing.com offers a Price Predictor that uses algorithms to determine how likely a fare is to rise or fall during the next seven days. It applies to flights from more than 250 cities in the United States and to top domestic destinations and major hubs in Europe.<query> what is the average cost of a flight from the us to europe</query> If you decide to wait in the hopes of a price drop, sign up for fare alerts offered by practically every travel site, from American Airlines to Travelzoo. Yapta.com, another price-tracking service, alerts travelers when the price of their plane tickets drop after purchase, allowing travelers to request an airline voucher for the price difference. For the cheapest dates to fly, go to Itasoftware.com , which allows you to scan an entire month’s worth of fares. To buy, you must go to the airline’s Web site or online agencies like Travelocity. Finally, buying two one-way fares on separate airlines can be cheaper than the best round-trip price. Kayak.com calls such tickets “hacker fares.” A recent search on the site for a flight from Boston to San Juan, P.R., turned up a fare of $313 on Delta to San Juan, returning on US Airways, compared with $349 round trip on US Airways alone.<query> how to find the cheapest airline tickets</query> http://SocialBusinessToday.net - The Best in Social Business Email This BlogThis!

""hdc1""--third IDE hard drive, first partition, etc. SCSI drives have analogous names but start with the letters ""sd"" (=""SCSI drive""), followed by the letter indicating the SCSI interface and by the number indicating the SCSI device id. For example, ""sda4"" means ""first SCSI interface, id number 4"".<query> what is the hda1</query> If you have an external zip drive attached to your parallel port, it will appear as SCSI device ""sda4"" (zip drives work in a SCSI-emulation mode). The listing of partitions that your Linux setup program presents to you during installation will include any MS Windows partitions which you have. For example, I have the following MS Windows partition: mount point type size comment [no mount] vfat 1200 MB [""Win C drive, hda1] /mnt/dos_hdd2 vfat 1600 MB [""Win D drive, hdd2] Don't erase these MS Windows partitions during your Linux installation if you want a dual boot. If you erase the MS Windows partition, MS Windows is gone from your system! If not sure, backup your data from your MS Windows partitions before Linux installation. ""msdos"", ""fat"" and ""vfat"" and ""ntfs"" are typical filesystems used by DOS and MS Windows 3.x/95/98/NT.<query> what is linux partition</query> As a quick reference, here is a brief summary of the standard linux partition types (""filesystems"") with a short description. I copied the info from the linux manual pages:man fs and man mount (with some additions after I had a look at the source code files at /usr/src/linux/fs). The underlined filesystems are the ones that you are more likely to use. Other filesystems (not listed below) are available as add-ons (for example journaling filesystems, compressed, encrypted, ...). minix is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks. ext is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.<query> what is the filesystem for linux</query> It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (ext2) and will eventually be removed from the kernel. ext2 is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the filesystems supported under Linux. In short, ext2 is the main (default, typical) Linux filesystem. ext3 is an extension of the ext2 filesystem with journaling. It is backwards and forward compatibile with ext2. It means that ext2 can be converted into ext3 without reformatting or data loss (just re-mounting the partion is required). ext3 can be changed back to ext2, also without data loss. I use ext3 extensively since Oct.2001--it is simple and trouble-free.<query> what is ext3</query> It is included as an installation ""option"" since RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. It is highly recommended that you use this filesystem. xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The xia filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is used infrequently. msdos is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8 characters followed by an optional period and 3 character extension. umsdos is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS. vfat is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.<query> what is msdos</query> VFAT adds capability for long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem. proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take up disk space. Seeman 5 proc. iso9660 is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard. Two extensions (listed below) are automatically supported. High Sierra --Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. Rock Ridge --Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.<query> what is iso9660</query> It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation. sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS. nfs is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers. smb is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by MS Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs. [Standard linux command ""smbmount"" will also do.] ncpfs is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.<query> what is linux smb</query> devpts--is a pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/ . fat --is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems. UFS --is a file system widely used in different operating systems. swap--is a special partition type used for swapping data from memory to hard drive. raiserfs--is a brand new journaling filesystem available as standard with Linux kernel version 2.4.1 up (January 2001). hfs (=hierarchical files system)--MacIntosh filesystem. It is a late beta version. , i.e., not recommended for use with critical data, unless read-only.<query> what is pts</query> ntfs--MS Windows NT filesytem. It is still ""experimental"" under Linux, i.e. not recommeded for production machines, unless read-only (Aug.2001). Next > 1.10 The MS Windows partition occupies my whole harddrive.

Linux Applications • 7. Learn Linux Commands • A. How to Upgrade Kernel? Before Linux installation, you might really want to know what a hard drive partition is. The concern is that you delete your MS Windows partition when you really don't want to--you want two separate partitions to dual boot. This means: MS Windows is on one partition, Linux is on a separate partition. You do not normally install Linux on free space on your MS Windows-allocated partition(s). It is possible to install Linux on a MS Windows partition, but we do not recommend it. If you plan a dual boot (Linux and MS Windows on the same computer), first use your DOS/Win utilityFDISK to make the MS Windows partition(s).<query> what is the partition for linux</query> Leave part of the hard drive(s) unpartitioned for Linux. You will make and format the Linux partitions during your RedHat (or Mandrake or whatever else) installation. Linux will recognize the free space on the harddrive. Make the MS Windows partition ""primary"" and ""bootable"". Install, configure, and test your MS Windows before Linux installation. If you plan to run Linux only, you need just a clean hard drive (no partitions) to start with. It is possible to have only one Linux partition (plus one for MS Windows if you dual-boot). But it is better to have more partitions so that you can keep users' data separate from the rest of the operating system. This way, if something ever goes wrong, or if you have to reformat or re-install the operating system, you don't lose the users' data.<query> how to install linux on a hard drive</query> (You can perform a complete Linux re-install without losing the contents of the /home directory that contains all user data if you skip the ""re-format"" option given to you during installation. But for that, the /home directory must be on its own partition.) During the Linux setup, you will be asked to partition the available space on your hard drive(s). There are many possible ways to partition, depending on your hard drive space, requirements, and taste. I like Linux hard drive partitions like this (for a modest total of 2 GB of hardrive space which I give to Linux in this example): mount point type size / ext2 300 MB /usr ext2 1200 MB /home ext2 380 MB swap swap 120 MB In the above example, I dedicate 300 MB for the root partition that holds the base of the Linux operating system.<query> how much space does linux need</query> I allocate 1200 MB to the mount point that will be visible on my filesystem as the/usr directory and will contain the user's programs (the programs that don't come with the base operating system and I install later, for example StarOffice). I dedicate 380 MB for the partition that will be visible as the directory/home and will contain the setting and data of all users on the machine. And I allocate 120 MB to a ""raw"" partition for the operating system to use as the virtual memory (extension of the physical, silicon memory on the hard drive, so-called swap). If your kernel is lower than 2.2 (this is the case with standard RH5.2 and earlier), your swap partition cannot be larger than approximately 127 MB. The rule of thumb is that the swap should be about twice the amount of the physical memory (RAM).<query> what is the size of a swap partition</query> If you need more (e.g. if you have lots of physical memory, or you expect to run custom programs with really large data structures) you might want to create a larger swap partition during the installation (or several smaller swap partitions) or add a swap file(s) later. 2 GB is a respectible amount of disk space and should be sufficient for users who like having many applications. (This is because Linux applications tend to be slimmer than their MS Windows equivalents). However, if you try to install everything that's available on the modern distribution CDs, you will surely run out of disk space. My experience is that however large the hard drive space, it will get filled and I regret I don't have more :-) . If my space on the hard drive is really restricted, I may consider a two-partition setup like this (for a lean 650 MB total dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 600 MB swap swap 50 MB<query> how much space do i need for linux</query> In this example, I dedicate 600 MB to the base of the operating system, applications, and user documents/data, and allow 50 MB for the swap partition (for the operating system to use as the virtual memory). The 50-MB swap should be quite sufficient for medium duty operations. The limitation of 600 MB for the operating system, applications and user data means that you will have to be very selective as to which applications you install or else you risk running out of hard drive space. Try pressing when installing the optional software that comes on the Red Hat CD--it will give you a short description of what the software does so you could perhaps decide if you really need it. (Don't worry too much if you miss something you need, you can install the missing parts later).<query> how much space does a redhat cd need</query> You can easily finish the RedHat installation with 200 MB free on your Linux partition (out of 600 MB used in this example) if you make reasonable choices. Please note that ""bundling together"" the root partition ""/"" and the /home directory will likely save you some disk space, but it is not the safest solution. It is possible to install Linux on even less disk space than in the example above, but you will have to be really picky as to what you install. For a larger available hard drive space, I may consider the following setup (for a comfortable total of 15 GB dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 800 MB /usr ext2 5000 MB /usr/local ext2 3000 MB /home ext2 5200 MB swap swap 1000 MB Please note that the the mount points can reside on different physical hard drives.<query> how much space do i need to install linux</query> Linux agglomarates all the hard drive space into a single directory tree. Another consideration when setting up the partitions on older computers (486?). Many older BIOSes have the restriction that the boot partition cannot extend beyond the 1024th cylinder on your first physical hard drive. To overcome this limitation, simply make the first (bootable) partition so that it ends before the cylinder number 1023 (this makes this partition max approximately 512 MB in size, which is plenty for the ""/"" root partition). Once Linux boots, the BIOS restriction does not matter any more because Linux takes over the hardware management and it can access the partition(s) beyond the cylinder number 1023. When installing and using Linux, your drives appear as devices with the following names: hda--first IDE drive (stands for ""hard drive a"", i.e. the master drive on the first IDE interface), hdb--second IDE drive (i.e., the slave drive on the first IDE interface), hdc--third IDE drive (i.e. the master drive on the second IDE interface), hdd--fourth IDE drive (i.e. the slave drive on the second IDE interface).<query> what is the partition number for linux</query>"

Why is a “3-way” switch? A 3-way switch enables one or more light fixtures to be operated from two different locations, for example, at opposite ends of a hallway or at the top and bottom of a stairway. The term “3-way” refers to the fact that there are three terminals on a 3-way switch, instead of the two terminals found on a standard on-off switch. What is the difference between an outlet and a receptacle? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Technically, an outlet is where a light or appliance is connected to the circuit's wires. A receptacle is the device that is often called an ""outlet,"" the cords for lamps, appliances, or other electrical equipment is plugged into.<query> what is the difference between a breaker and a receptacle</query> What is the difference between a device, a fixture, and an appliance? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A fixture usually refers to a light that is permanently installed in a ceiling or a wall. An appliance refers to almost any electrically powered machine or apparatus that uses electricity. A device (e.g., switch, breaker, receptacle) is used to allow or interrupt the flow of current through the circuit to fixtures, appliances, or lamps. If some things are not working, where is the best place to begin looking for the problem? First check to see that the light or appliance in question is plugged in securely and that no bulbs are burned out. Then reset any breakers and GFCIs that may have tripped. You may need to look for an open (loose, corroded, broken) connection.<query> what is the difference between a fixture and an appliance</query> What is happening when lights or appliances will go out for a while and then come back on their own? This usually indicates a loose connection that makes contact intermittently, as when a wire is moved or pressure is applied to the connection. Loose connections can generate heat and may present a fire hazard. You can isolate the problem by moving the lamp or appliance to a different outlet to see if the problem lies with the lamp or the outlet. How can I tell if a circuit is overloaded? The most obvious indication that a circuit is overloaded is where the circuit breaker trips and then trips again after resetting it. If you are running several lights or appliances on the same circuit, first try shutting some of them off to see if that corrects the problem. If you are running several appliances on a surge strip or extension cord, check the label for the maximum number of watts that should be run on it.<query> what does it mean when a light goes out and comes back on its own</query> If the surge strip or extension cord is hot to the touch, stop using it immediately. What should I do if a circuit breaker trips when I am using a vacuum, hairdryer or other appliance? Appliances such as vacuums or hair dryers can draw a lot of power and may trip a circuit breaker. The simplest remedy is to turn off other appliances while using one of these appliances. If the problem persists, it may indicate that additional circuits should be added to handle the load. What should I do if I get a shock when touching a faucet or pipe? If you live near high-voltage power lines, those lines may create voltage in your pipes; the power company may or may not be able to help. Otherwise, the particular circuit responsible can be identified and the stray wire located. The grounding of those pipes should be checked.<query> what to do if a circuit breaker trips</query> What causes lights to flicker? Flickering lights usually indicate a poor connection in the light or contact somewhere in the circuit or in the panel. Finding the exact source of the problem-point can be difficult. It can be caused by a bad light socket or a poor electrical connection somewhere in the wires leading to the light (most likely right at the fixture). Flickering can cause the bad connection to get hot and may start a fire. If you cannot locate the cause of the flickering and it affects many or all lights, this could indicate a bad neutral connection, which can also be dangerous. Another indication of a neutral problem; as larger appliances (washing machines/dishwashers) cycle lights will get noticeably brighter or dimmer (minor changes in intensity are normal). If you suspect this problem have either the electric company or an electrician check it out.<query> what causes a light to flicker</query> What causes the lights to sometimes go dim or get extra bright? It’s not unusual for the lights to go dim or get bright when an appliance or motor goes on or off. What causes a light, switch, or breaker box to hum? Some dimmer switches will cause light fixtures to hum. At the breaker panel, the 60 cycles per second of your alternating current can set up a vibration or slight buzz or hum in some components. Fluorescent lights, transformers, and an electric water heater can also hum. All these are fairly normal, but if the hum is loud, it may mean that the component is loose or close to failing. If a circuit breaker gets wet, it can cause a buzzing sound as the moisture is boiled off. A loud buzzing at a breaker could indicate that the breaker overloading without tripping as it should.<query> what causes a light to hum</query> Should I be concerned if a switch or outlet gets hot? Yes. An outlet that is hot to the touch likely means that wires connecting to it are loose or that the outlet needs to be replaced. You should contact a licensed electrician immediately. A hot switch is usually a dimmer switch (it may or may not still be able to dim lights). If more than 600 watts of light bulbs are controlled by a single dimmer, it is probably overloaded. In that case, install a switch rated to handle more watts or replace the bulbs in the fixture with lower-wattage bulbs. Normally dimmers perform best when they control 80% of their rated load. A dimmer rated at 600 watts, means 480 watts is all the more load that dimmer should control. For example 8- 60 watt bulbs is all that should be connected to that dimmer.<query> what is the hot switch on a light switch</query> What causes a circuit breaker to get hot? It is normal for circuit breakers to be warm when current is running through them, but if one is hotter than the others, it may indicate a poor connection. If you have been running an appliance that draws a lot of current, (a space heater, for example) for an extended period, this would be normal, but the excess heat may trip the breaker. If there is a smell like burning plastic what might be happening? If you smell burning plastic from something electrical, it may indicate a poor connection that is creating heat, and melting the plastic housing of the outlet. Turn off whatever is plugged in and remove the plug. This presents a possible fire hazard and you should contact a licensed electrician immediately. Why do some light bulbs burn out more quickly than others?<query> why does my circuit breaker smell like plastic</query> There are several factors that may cause light bulbs to burn out quickly. Light bulbs that are used more often will, of course burn out faster. If the lights are left on a lot, such as an outdoor light that is left on all night, then the bulbs will have to be changed more often. Turning a bulb on and off frequently also reduces the life of the bulb. When a fixture cannot dissipate the heat of its bulbs, it takes a toll on the bulbs and on the fixture's sockets and wires. Or there may be loose connections in the wiring of a circuit. The packaging of any light bulb should have an average life expectancy printed on it. A typical light bulb will last roughly 900 hours. At 10 hours a day, that’s three months. Less expensive bulbs may be of lesser quality and not last as long.<query> how long do light bulbs last</query> If you compute the average life of your bulbs and discover it’s clearly less than the manufacturer’s rated life, this may be caused by: Over-voltage in your house. Occasionally this causes more serious problems. You can check the voltage in your home with an inexpensive multimeter available at most hardware or electronics stores. If the voltage is 125V or higher, contact your power company about it. 7 or 8 extra volts on a 120V line can dramatically reduce the life expectancy of a light bulb. If it’s a slight over-voltage, you can buy special 125V bulbs, though they may be hard to find. The life expectancy of a bulb will also be affected by the quality of power from the power company. This includes the little surges and spikes that are better known for their effect on computers. But it also includes the basic voltage level coming to the home from the utility.<query> what is the voltage of a light bulb</query> Electricity is simply a flow of electrons. Electricity is seen in nature in the form of lightning or in static electricity, such as you might experience by touching a metal doorknob after shuffling your feet on a carpeted floor. Electricity that we use in our daily lives is produced from a variety of sources, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or increasingly from wind turbines and photovoltaic solar arrays. The power is then distributed through a nationwide grid that balances production capacity with power demand. What is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage? Voltage pushes current through a resistance, using power (wattage). What is the relationship between amperes, ohms, watts, and volts? W (volts) push X amperes (current) through Y ohms (resistance), using Z watts.<query> what is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage?</query> Many homes receive more than the average 120 volts that most bulbs are designed to handle and this shortens their stated life. A good solution to this is to look for the same bulb but with a ""130v"" rating stamped on the bulb instead of ""120v"". The light output of these won’t be quite as bright, but you will spend time changing bulbs. Too high a wattage bulb in too small an enclosed fixture (such as a globe). Because the heat cannot escape, the bulb will burn too hot, shortening bulb life. Recessed lighting fixtures covered by insulation, which blocks ventilation. Heat can build up around the bulb, causing short bulb life. Vibration bulbs in use under a stairway, on or near an out of balance bathroom or ceiling fan, or near a door that gets slammed, or any activity that sends vibration through the building can shorten bulb life Shock resistant, or “rough service” bulbs are one solution for this situation. .<query> what causes bulbs to shorten life</query> back to top GFCI Outlets What is a GFCI outlet? The initials “GFCI” stand for ground-fault circuit interrupter. A GFCI (or simply “GFCI”) outlet is a safety device that prevents dangerous electric shocks by cutting power to an outlet immediately when it detects a short circuit. For example, if water from a nearby sink is splashed on a GFCI outlet, the power would be cut to the outlet before a person could be shocked or electrocuted. In the home, GFCI outlets and breakers are typically found in kitchens, bathrooms and other locations where water is present. What does the light on a GFCI outlet indicate? Some newer GFCI outlets have lights, which may indicate different things on different brands. On some brands the light indicates that the GFCI is tripped and needs to be reset.<query> what is gfci</query> On other brands, the reverse is true, and the light indicates that the outlet is live. Can a circuit fail without tripping a breaker or a GFCI? Yes. A circuit can fail if a connection at the breaker or at the circuit's neutral wire in the electrical panel comes loose or deteriorates. More often these ""opens"" involve less than the entire circuit because a connection somewhere on the circuit—at another outlet box for example—has failed. Why won't a GFCI reset? A GFCI may fail to reset because of a ground-fault occurring at another outlet that is wired in sequence with the GFCI. A single GFCI device can protect as many as three additional outlets that are wired “downstream” of the GFCI. It could be the GFCI itself has no power reaching it because of a short or an open or another GFCI that is tripped upstream from it.<query> why won't a gfci reset</query> Tripped GFCIs made after 2002 cannot be reset if power is not reaching their line terminals. If a GFCI will not reset, should it be replaced? Possibly, but it is more common for a GFCI receptacle to retrip (or to not reset) for reasons other than a bad GFCI. A new GFCI installed in the same location may not reset either. There may be a ground-fault at some ""downstream"" wire or receptacle or electrical device. Your GFCI that won't reset could have been installed incorrectly recently; since 2002 GFCI receptacles have had a feature that won't let them reset if they are hooked up wrong or if power is not on. The typical service life of a GFCI is 6-10 years. GFCI outlets should be checked regularly to make sure they are functioning properly. How can you tell when a GFCI goes bad?<query> why won't my gfci reset</query> The most common way for a GFCI device to fail is that it will continue to supply power after you push the test button. When a GFCI fails, it no longer provides protection from dangerous electric shocks. GFCI devices made after 2002 will not reset if they are not receiving power. GFCI devices made before 2002, whose reset stays in, can fail to operate for the same reason — not receiving power. If a GFCI will not reset and/or retrips immediately after resetting, it may indicate a fault condition “downstream” from the GFCI, rather than a malfunction of the GFCI. What is the difference between a surge arrester and a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS)? These terms are often used interchangeably and rather loosely. However, the two terms have different meanings as defined by the National Electrical Code® (NEC®) (www.nfpa.org), their UL listing, and applicable IEEE/ANSI standards.<query> what is the difference between a surge arrester and a tvss</query> A secondary arrester refers to a surge protective device (SPD) that is listed for use ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility (the service entrance panel), while a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS) is only listed to be used after this primary disconnect. An SPD listed under UL1449 as a TVSS device must not be connected ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility. However, secondary surge arresters can be connected either upstream or downstream of the main disconnect back to top Dimmers What is the function of a dimmer? A dimmer provides the flexibility to vary the amount of light in a room depending on the size of the space, the time of day, and the task or activity being performed. Dimmers may be used almost anywhere: bathrooms, bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, game rooms, hallways, kitchens, living rooms, media rooms, or office or commercial spaces.<query> what is the purpose of a dimmer</query> What makes the lights dim? An electrical component in the dimmer, called a “triac” turns the light on and off very rapidly—120 times per second. But with a dimmer, the human eye perceives a steady level of dimmed light. The longer the light is “on” versus “off,” the brighter the light appears. Conversely, when the light is “off” more than “on,” the lights are dimmer. If the lights are being turned on and off, won’t the lights seem to be flickering? No. No matter how bright or how dim, the light level is constant and smooth. The human eye sees things after they go away. An example of this is in movies where the film is projected on the screen many times a second. Doesn’t turning the lights on and off so quickly decrease bulb life?<query> why do lights flicker</query> No. Switching the bulb does not decrease bulb life. Heat decreases bulb life, and by reducing heat, bulb life is increased. Do dimmers save electricity and/or increase lamp life? Yes. The longer the triac is off, the lower the light output, and the greater the energy savings. Dimmers can save electricity, save money and help increase the life of the lamps (light bulbs) being controlled. Dimmers can increase the life of incandescent bulbs and halogen bulbs (which are a type of incandescent bulb.) The table below shows the energy savings and increase in life of the lamp (light bulb) that can be achieved with dimmers. Percentage dimmed Energy savings Lamp life increase 10% 10% 2x 25% 20% 4x 50% 40% 20x 75% 60% >20x What light sources can be controlled by dimmers?<query> do dimmers save electricity</query> Most standard dimmers can control standard incandescent lamps that use 120 volts. Other dimmers can control low voltage xenon or halogen light sources that use 12 or 24 volts. Low voltage lighting systems use either an electronic or a magnetic transformer and there are dimmers specifically designed for each type of transformer. If the wrong type of dimmer is used, it will cause the low voltage light fixtures to flicker. Can one dimmer control both a line voltage light fixture AND a low voltage lighting system? If the low voltage lighting system uses an electronic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Likewise, if the low voltage lighting system uses a magnetic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Does dimming affect halogen bulb life? Yes. Dimming increases incandescent lamp life.<query> what type of dimmer is used for low voltage lighting</query> Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament. Lutron’s pilot test data suggests the halogen lamps will have an expected lamp life similar to other incandescent lamps when dimmed. As an example, one type of halogen lamp with a rated life of 2,000 hours dimmed to 80 V has a life extension of at least five times. Can neon/cold cathode lamps be dimmed? Yes. Neon/cold cathode lamps can be dimmed using the proper equipment. Lutron Nova low voltage dimmers and GRAFIC Eye controls are UL listed for neon/cold cathode loads. back to top Dimming CFLs and LEDs Dimming saves energy while setting the right light level to improve mood and ambiance. Screw-in compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and screw-in light emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) are a great energy-saving alternative to incandescent or halogen light sources; however, dimming them may be difficult.<query> can halogen lamps be dimmed</query> Amps times ohms = volts. Amps times volts = watts. How do I know if the wiring in my home is safe? If the wiring in your home was 1) installed by a professional electrician, 2) inspected and approved by your local electrical inspector, and 3) has not been modified or damaged, then your wiring should be safe. But, if for any reason you suspect that some of the wiring in your home is not safe, contact a professional electrician to identify and correct the problem. back to top Circuits and Circuit Breakers What is a circuit? A circuit is the actual or intended path of current between points of differing voltage. In the case of a conventional household 120 volt circuit, the path runs from the ""hot"" wire from the circuit breaker in the electrical panel, to an outlet or fixture and through a device or appliance that is using the electricity, then back to the breaker in the panel via a ""neutral"" wire connected to the grounded neutral bar in the panel.<query> what is the difference between volts and amps</query> Lutron’s new CFLâ€¢LED (Câ€¢Lâ„¢) Dimmers with HEDâ„¢ Technology help alleviate your CFL and LED dimming challenges. Challenges of dimming CFLs and LEDs with standard dimmers Energy-saving CFLs have been in the marketplace for many years but a broad range of dimmable bulbs has only recently become available. LEDs are even newer to the market and dimmable versions are also only recently available. These dimmable bulbs, especially CFLs, have historically presented problems when used on standard incandescent dimmers. Common problems include: Reduced dimming range: Incandescent/halogen bulbs will typically dim lower than CFL or LED bulbs. Most dimmable CFLs will dim down to 10% to 30% measured light output. Early versions of dimmable LEDs on the market have the ability to dim lower than CFLs and can reach levels as low as 5% to 15% measured light.<query> what is the difference between cfl and led</query> The actual dimming range is dictated by the bulb’s circuitry. Lights dropping out: As CFL or LED bulbs are dimmed, they will sometimes turn off before the slider reaches the bottom. Referred to as “drop out,” this makes it extremely difficult to set the dimmer at the right level without bulbs turning off. Lights not turning on: After being dimmed to a low light level and switched off, sometimes CFL or LED bulbs will not turn on until the dimmer’s slider is moved up. This is referred to as “pop-on,” which is especially challenging in 3-way situations where lights can be turned on/off from different locations, not just using the dimmer. Lights turning off unexpectedly: Dimmable CFL and LED bulbs can be influenced by line voltage fluctuations. As your incandescent bulbs will sometimes dim or flicker when a device such as air-conditioning or a hair dryer is used, a dimmed CFL or LED can actually turn off or flicker excessively in those situations.<query> why do cfl bulbs turn off</query> Note: Actual performance of any CFL or LED will vary from bulb type to bulb type and among different manufacturers. It is important to note that only bulbs that have been designed as dimmable should be used on a dimmer. To find out if your bulb is dimmable, please check the package, the bulb itself, or call the bulb manufacturer directly. Why do dimmers get warm, and is this safe? During normal operation, solid-state dimmers generate heat. A solid state dimmer is roughly 98% efficient—2% of the power is dissipated as heat, which causes the dimmer to feel warm to the touch. The closer a dimmer is run to full output and the higher the load (watts) on the dimmer, the warmer it will feel. This is perfectly normal and safe. Lutron dimmers are designed to the strictest UL safety standard, and can handle their full rated load (a 600 W dimmer can handle a full 600 W of power without overheating.<query> why do dimmer get warm</query> (Dimmers that are ganged together in a common wallbox may need to be derated.) What is “common neutral interaction”? Common neutral interaction occurs between at least two dimmers that share the same neutral wire. When solid-state dimmers are operating, voltage spikes occur and are transmitted onto the neutral wire. Normally this is of little concern. When the neutral wire is common (to 2 or more phases of a 3-phase, 4-wire system) the voltage spikes may feed back to the dimmers. The common neutral wire can cause interaction between the dimmers that are on different phases. The following are symptoms of common neutral interaction: Lights flicker at certain dimmer settings Lights flash to full output at certain dimmer settings Light level of a dimmer on 1 phase inadvertently changes when a dimmer on another phase is adjusted.<query> what is common neutral interaction</query> Lutron recommends the following methods to avoid common neutral interaction: Run separate neutral wires for each dimming circuit, from each dimmer’s load to the distribution panel Install a lamp debuzzing coil What is radio frequency interference (RFI)? RFI is a buzzing noise that may occur in some audio and radio equipment when solid state dimmers are used nearby. Although every Lutron dimmer contains a filter to suppress RFI, additional filtering may be required in some applications. Typical examples of RFI sensitive equipment are AM radios, stereo sound systems, broadcasting equipment, intercom systems, public address systems, and wireless telephones. back to top LED Lights What is an LED light? LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. A diode is a semiconductor that allows current to flow in only one direction. Semiconductor diodes are a junction of two materials, one with a positive and the other with a negative charge.<query> what is rfi</query> When this PN junction is applied with a forward voltage, electrons and holes are brought together releasing light energy. Hence: Light Emitting Diode. What is the difference between an incandescent bulb and an LED bulb? Incandescent bulbs creates light when current is run through a filament. Resistance in the filament generates heat, which causes it to glow and produces light. LEDs create light when power is applied to semiconductors (usually gallium, arsenic and phosphorous), which are stimulated by the movement of electrons, creating visible light. How does the brightness of LED lighting compare to incandescent lighting? LED light bulbs are much brighter than incandescent or halogen bulbs of the same wattage, but LED bulbs are not available in very high wattages. Thus, when replacing incandescent or halogen lamps with LED lamps, more LED lamps are often needed.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and led light bulbs</query> For example, replacing one 100-watt incandescent bulb may require two 5-watt or 6-watt LED bulbs. Nevertheless, LED lights can save up to 85% of the electricity used by a traditional incandescent bulb. How bright are LED light bulbs? The brightest LED bulbs produce light comparable to a 120-watt incandescent bulb while only consuming the electricity of a 25 watt incandescent bulb. LED bulbs available for standard fixtures vary in brightness from less than 50 lumens up to about 1200 lumens. The brightest LED bulbs for standard fixtures are floodlights and spotlights. The brightest LED bulbs with approximately the same size and shape as ordinary incandescent bulbs produce up to 600 lumens. Are bulbs with more LEDs brighter than bulbs with less? Different types of LEDs vary greatly in size and light output and the number of LEDs does not determine brightness.<query> what is the brightest led light bulb</query> The most accurate indicators of the brightness of LED bulbs are the measured lumens or lux. Lumens measure the total amount of light output from a bulb. Lux measures how bright the light is on a surface at a specified distance. How efficient are LED bulbs compared to incandescent bulbs? Newer LED light bulbs are more than five times as efficient as comparable incandescent bulbs. In addition, because LED bulbs direct a larger percentage of light where it is needed, in some applications they are as much as ten times as effective as incandescent bulbs, reducing energy use by 90%. Why do LEDs use such little power? LEDs do not use a filament where a conductor is heated and light is created. Filament based lighting consumes more power than the light produced. LEDs produce very little heat and do not use filaments, making them far more efficient in consumption and output.<query> how efficient are led lights</query> In addition, incandescent bulbs project light in every direction (omni directional) as opposed to LED lights which project light in specified directions (such as 20, 50 and 120 degrees) due to their package design and layout. What is the useful life of LED bulbs? High quality, white LED bulbs typically last for 50,000 hours. By contrast, most traditional incandescent bulbs have a useful life of 1,000 hours and halogen bulbs typically last about 3,000 hours. And an average compact fluorescent bulb typically lasts for 10,000 hours. In an average home, if an LED bulb burned from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. 365 days a year, it would last more than 25 years. But unlike other types of lights, LED bulbs slowly decrease in brightness over time, rather than burning out suddenly. Near the end of its service life, an LED bulb will typically put out only 70% of its original light.<query> how long do led lights last</query> Higher quality LED lights have design features that enable them to burn brighter, longer. Can LED lights be used with a dimmer? LED lights that are dimmable indicate on the package or website. Make sure you check with the manufacturer of the LED for dimmer compatibility. What is an LED driver? An LED driver is a self-contained power supply that has outputs matched to the electrical characteristics of the LED or array of LEDs. Drivers should be current-regulated (deliver a consistent current over a range of load voltages). Dimmable LED drivers may also offer dimming by means of pulse width modulation (PWM) circuits. Drivers may have more than one channel for separate control of different LEDs or arrays. Are outdoor LEDs affected by extreme weather conditions? LED lights are designed to function in temperatures from -40F to 180F, exceeding the conditions where most incandescent and florescent bulbs will fail.<query> what is led driver</query> A typical home has many circuits, with each individual circuit supplying power to a number of outlets or fixtures. A single room may receive power from two or more circuits. Technically, each loop that current makes (through a single light and its switch, for example) is a circuit, but the most common meaning is the ""branch circuit"", that is, everything fed (or interrupted) by a given breaker or fuse. Do circuit breakers ever go bad or wear out? Yes, but not very often. When a breaker will not reset, the cause may be a short that is retripping it immediately or you may not be resetting it properly. Circuit breakers have toggle switches with three positions: on, off, and tripped. When the breaker is tripped, you must move the toggle switch all the way to the off position before moving it to the on position.<query> what is the difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker</query> In addition, while florescent bulbs need to warm up to achieve full brightness in cold weather, there is no warm up time needed for LEDs. Is it true that LED lights do not attract insects? Generally, yes. Most insects cannot see the spectrum of light produced by LEDs. Are LED diodes inherently directional? LED diodes are not inherently directional. One way to boost light intensity is to focus the beam more tightly. This is accomplished with a lens that directs light. MR and PAR series LEDs have a beam angle of 15 to 60 degrees. This does not change the light output, only the direction of the light. Do LEDs produce heat? LEDs ordinarily produce only a fraction of the heat produced by incandescent bulbs. If LEDs are hot to the touch, they are poorly designed being overpowered due to improper circuitry.<query> do led lights attract insects</query> What does CRI stand for? The color rendering index (CRI) (sometimes called color rendition index), is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully compared to a natural light source. Why are LEDs different colors? The color of an LED is a function of the material used to make the junction. There are two main materials used in visible light LED junctions: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN): used to make up the blue, white, true green, and UV types Aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP or AlInGaP): used to make the red, yellow, and orange types Are LEDs available in “warm” and “cool” light output, like traditional lights? How do you make a white LED? Yes. LED lights can be “tuned” to look warm or cool by adjusting the amounts of colors in the mix or by using a blue LED with a phosphor coating.<query> what is the color of led</query> The coating emits a yellow light when the blue light from the LED shines on it. The mix of the yellow light with the blue light forms a white light. Inefficiency in the phosphor conversion is one reason that a white LED is less efficient overall than a colored LED. Some of the light energy is lost in the conversion to yellow. What is the difference between an LED floodlight and a spotlight? LED spotlights put out a narrower beam of light than a floodlight, typically less than 45 degrees wide. LED floodlights put out a wider beam of light, up to 120 degrees A spotlight is more suited to illuminating objects and a floodlight is more suited to illuminating areas. back to top Dark Sky Regulated Lights What are Dark Sky Regulated Lights? Growing populations have increased the need for lighting ten-fold in the past 25 years.<query> what is the difference between a led floodlight and led spotlight</query> “Dark sky” regulations are intended to reduce “light pollution” caused by the over-lighting of various places in the city such as streets, parking lots, and decorative lighting. What is light pollution and why is it important? Light pollution indicates wasted energy. Light pollution blocks the view of stars and other celestial bodies. Light pollution is not limited to big cities, and is a concern beyond astronomers and dark sky enthusiasts. You experience light pollution when you can’t sleep at night because of a neighbor’s outdoor light, when a driver’s headlights are too intense for your dark-adjusted eyes and the glare becomes blinding, and can also have an adverse effect on wildlife. Dark sky regulated lights cut glare and prevent light trespass that will reduce sky glow and thus waste less energy. Glare, light trespass and sky glow are those components of wasted for outdoor lighting.<query> why is it important to have a dark sky</query> What is glare? Glare affects motorists at night when the high-beam lights of an oncoming car makes it difficult to see. Resolve this by aiming lights down or using a visor to shield the light from people’s eyes. What is light trespass? Light trespass refers to bright light that intrudes on neighboring property. An example would be light from a commercial parking lot that shines into a window or back yard, limiting the use of the yard in the evening. Dark sky regulations require the lights to be aimed down or shielded so the light is limited to a specific spot, or motion sensors. This also affects wildlife. What is sky glow? People living in large cities rarely see the dark night sky because of sky glow. Sky glow can adversely affect wildlife and limit the enjoyment of the night sky.<query> what is the definition of light trespass</query> Sky glow, virtually always indicates wasted energy. Properly installed outdoor lighting will prevent this. (For more information on dark sky regulations, visit www.darksky.org). What is being done to address the problem? Many neighborhood associations and community leaders are trying to preserve our natural dark skies, especially in areas near wildlife and state parks. Many communities are passing legislation to regulate the use and design of outdoor lighting. Such lighting equipment is often referred to as Dark Sky Compliant, Cut-off Lighting, Friendly Lighting or Good Neighbor Lighting, Dark Sky Regulated. These names all refer to fixtures that are designed to reduce upward light reflection, glare, trespassing light, inefficient energy use and urban sky glow. The lighting industry has responded by creating light fixtures that consumers can easily install with little modification to their existing systems.<query> what is the purpose of the light fixture</query> This response has allowed dark sky compliance to be more accessible to the general public. Simple technologies and modifications to outdoor fixtures like motion-sensor activated flood lights, timers; hoods and reflectors even using focused lights in lower wattages can help. back to top Energy Star What is Energy Star? Energy Star is a government program dedicated to awareness and the promotion of energy efficient products for both consumers and manufacturers. The Energy Star program is administered jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Energy Star identifies and recommends products with the highest industry standards of quality and low-energy consumption. Products with the Energy Star label use less energy and therefore save the user money on electricity. For example, on average, fluorescent lights use only 2/3 as much energy as their incandescent counterparts, and some last up to 10 times longer.<query> what is energy star</query> The extra accost of compact fluorescent bulbs will be exceeded in cost savings over the life of the bulb. In addition, because Energy Star products use less energy, they also help reduce air pollution from power generators. (For more information visit:www.energystar.gov.) Doesn’t energy efficient equal ugly, industrial and bulky? No. More efficient lighting does not mean less light or less attractive lighting. New lighting technology provides both equal illumination and the choice of “warm” or “cool” light available in traditional lighting. Some early models of efficient lights featured large, bulky bulbs and humming ballasts, but these problems are all in the past. Energy efficient lighting is now available in almost any style and for any application, and new technologies such as LED lights are becoming more common and more affordable every day.<query> why are energy efficient bulbs used</query> Is energy efficient lighting as safe as traditional lighting? Yes. In addition, fluorescent and LED lights are much cooler to the touch than regular halogen and incandescent lights and thus are less of a fire hazard. What else can I do to be more energy efficient? Research energy efficient solutions available in your community. Many communities now issue rebates or other incentive including free upgrades to switch over to more energy efficient fixtures. Many local environmental agencies provide consumer tips on saving energy and money. Small modifications such as timers, motion-sensors, photo-cells as well as solar energy can help the environment. Simply shutting off a light when you leave the room makes a great difference if a million people do it. Especially in the summer and winter months, there are high demands on electricity. Small things like installing a ceiling fan and reversing the fan’s direction during the winter months to distribute trapped heat from the ceiling.<query> what is the best way to conserve energy</query> In the summer, cool only those areas of the house that are actually in use. back to top Smoke Alarms Why should my home have smoke alarms? In the event of a fire, properly installed and maintained smoke alarms provide an early warning so people can escape in time. Smoke alarms are one of the most effective safety devices you can buy and install to protect yourself, your family and your home. What types of smoke alarms are available? There are many different brands of smoke alarms on the market but they fall under two basic types: ionization and photoelectric. Ionization alarms sound more quickly when a flaming, fast moving fire occurs. Photoelectric smoke alarms are better at sensing smoldering smoky fires. There are also combination smoke alarms, called dual sensor smoke alarms, that combine ionization and photoelectric into one unit.<query> what type of alarms are there</query> If the breaker will not reset after repeated attempts, it is best to call a professional electrician. How much area can be served by one circuit? How many outlets can be wired on one GFCI? A 15-amp circuit should not serve over more than 600 square feet of a home. A 20-amp circuit should not serve more than 800 square feet. Some GFCI manufacturers recommend no more than eight outlets downstream. A lengthy series of GFCI loads can trip the GFCI. If that is suspected, each such load outlet could be given its own GFCI receptacle, connected to protect only itself. What is the difference between hot, neutral, and ground wires? Typical electrical cable includes a minimum of three wires: hot, neutral, and ground. The “hot” wire, which is usually black in color, carries current from the power source, such as a home’s electrical panel, to a switch, outlet or fixture.<query> how many outlets can be on a gfci</query> Because both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms are better at detecting distinctly different yet potentially fatal fires, the U.S. Fire Administration recommends the installation of both ionization and photoelectric or dual sensor smoke alarms. In addition to alarms that provide an audible warning, there are alarms people with hearing disabilities. These alarms may use strobe lights that flash and/or vibrate to alert those who are unable to hear standard smoke alarms when they sound. Where should smoke alarms be placed? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Since smoke and many deadly gases rise, smoke alarms are usually installed on the ceiling or high on a wall close to the ceiling. Smoke alarms should be installed on every level of the home, including the basement. For extra safety, install smoke alarms both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Are smoke alarms hard to install?<query> where should smoke alarms be placed</query> If your smoke alarms are hard wired, that is, wired into the home’s electrical system, you will need to have a qualified electrician do the initial installation or install replacements. Battery-powered smoke alarms can usually be installed with simple hand tools. Some models can even be installed with adhesives. For all smoke alarm installations, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation. In some localities, fire departments will help install a smoke alarm in your home for you. Call your local fire department (on a non-emergency telephone number) if you have questions about installing a smoke alarm. How do I keep my smoke alarm working? In standard-type battery powered smoke alarms, It’s important to test every smoke alarm monthly and replace the batteries with new ones at least once a year.<query> how to install a smoke alarm</query> The whole unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. Helpful tip: Choose a day that is easy to remember, such as a holiday or birthday and replace the batteries each year on that day. Most smoke alarms make a “chirping” sound to signal that the batteries need to be replaced. Smoke alarms powered by long-lasting batteries are designed to replace the entire unit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Hard wired smoke alarms may or may not have battery backup. For hard-wired, battery back-up smoke alarms, just as with a battery-only model, the batteries should be checked monthly, and replaced at least once per year. The entire unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. How long do smoke alarms last? Most alarms installed today have a life span of about 8-10 years.<query> how often should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> After this time, the entire unit should be replaced. It is a good idea to write the date of purchase with a marker on the inside of your alarm so you will know when to replace it. Some smoke alarms have the date of manufacture printed on a label inside the unit. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for replacement. What if the alarm goes off while I’m cooking? Do not disable the smoke alarm if it goes off because of cooking or other non-fire causes. Instead, fan the air near the smoke alarm, leaving the batteries in place. If this happens often, the alarm may need to be moved to a new location. Some of the newer models have a “hush” button that silences nuisance alarms. Also consider a photoelectric smoke detector for this area. The U.S. Fire Administration recommends the following fire safety and prevention practices.<query> when should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> Plan and practice escape plans several times a year and designate a safe meeting place. Never change your meeting place. Make sure your whole family knows when and how to call emergency telephone numbers from outside the house or neighbors. Install a fire extinguisher on each floor of the house and learn how to use it. Install carbon monoxide detectors. If you are building a new home or planning a major remodel, consider installing residential fire sprinklers. Contact your local fire department on a non-emergency phone number is you need help or have questions about fire safety in your home. back to top Carbon Monoxide What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, invisible gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels such as natural gas, propane, wood, charcoal, gasoline, kerosene, and oil.<query> what is the difference between carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide</query> In the home, carbon monoxide can be formed from the incomplete combustion from any flame-fueled (i.e., not electric) device, including ranges, ovens, clothes dryers, furnaces, fireplaces, grills, space heaters, and water heaters. Furnaces and water heaters may be sources of carbon monoxide, but if they are vented properly the carbon monoxide will escape to the outside. Open flames, such as from ovens or ranges, are the most common source of carbon monoxide. Vehicles are the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning. Running a car in a closed garage—especially an attached garage—can be extremely dangerous. If you are doing mechanical work on a car in a garage, leave the overhead door open or attach an air hose to vent the exhaust to the outside. How do carbon monoxide detectors work? Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time.<query> what is the most common source of carbon monoxide</query> Carbon monoxide can harm you if you are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide in a short period of time, or to lower levels of carbon monoxide over a long period of time. Carbon monoxide detectors require a continuous power supply, so if the power cuts off then the alarm becomes ineffective. Models are available that offer back-up battery power. Why is carbon monoxide dangerous? When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it interferes with the oxygen transport and gas exchange abilities of red blood cells. Low levels of carbon monoxide poisoning cause symptoms similar to those of the flu or a cold, including shortness of breath on mild exertion, headaches and nausea. Higher levels of poisoning lead to dizziness, mental confusion, severe headaches, nausea, and fainting on mild exertion. Ultimately, carbon monoxide poisoning can result in unconsciousness, permanent brain damage and death.<query> why is carbon monoxide dangerous</query> Carbon monoxide detectors are set to sound an alarm before the exposure to carbon monoxide would present a healthy adult. Babies, children, pregnant women, people with circulatory or respiratory ailments, and the elderly are more sensitive to carbon monoxide than healthy adults. Where should I place a carbon monoxide detector? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Because carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air and also because it may be found with warm, rising air, detectors should be placed on a wall at least five feet above the floor or on the ceiling. Do not place the detector near a fireplace or flame-producing appliance, such as a gas stove. A carbon monoxide detector should be installed on each floor of the house, especially near sleeping areas. What do I do if the alarm sounds? The alarm is designed to go off before you experience symptoms.<query> where should carbon monoxide detectors be placed</query> Silence the alarm, get all members of the household to fresh air, and if anyone is experiencing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, call 911. If no one has symptoms, ventilate the building, identify and remedy the source of the carbon monoxide before returning inside and have appliances or chimneys checked by a professional. How often should a carbon monoxide detector be replaced? The average life span of many carbon monoxide detectors is about two years. Be aware that the “test” feature on many detectors checks the functioning of the alarm but not the ability of the detector to detect carbon monoxide. Some detectors last longer than others, indicate when they need to be replaced, and have power supply backups. When purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, consider not only the number and type of possible carbon monoxide sources, but also the construction of the building.<query> how often should carbon monoxide detectors be replaced</query> Newer buildings may have more airtight construction and may be better insulated, which makes it easier for carbon monoxide to accumulate. back to top Attic Fans How do I calculate the size fan I need for an attic? Measure the square footage of your attic (length X width) and multiply that figure by 0.7. This will give you the minimum CFM (cubic feet per minute—the measure of air volume moved by the fan) rating required for your attic. Add 15 percent for dark covered roofs. Choose a fan with a CFM rating appropriate for your attic size to ensure adequate ventilation. How much free area air intake is needed for an attic fan to work properly? Divide the CFM required by 300 and then multiply the result by 144 (one square foot, in inches) to give you the square inches of free air area required.<query> how to calculate attic fan size</query> The neutral wire, which is usually white in color, carries current back to the electrical panel. (Recall that electricity needs to flow in a circular path.) The ground wire, which is usually bare of insulation, carries no current at all under normal circumstances. The ground wire is there for safety. It provides an alternative route for current and allows the current to be discharged into the ground in case there is a short circuit. Why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester? When a neutral wire is not continuous back to the panel as it should be, the current of the hot wire goes through anything that is ready to run (but won't) and shows up on the normally-neutral wire. What is the difference between an open, an overload, a short, and a ground-fault?<query> why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester?</query> How do I calculate the existing free air in my attic? If you have eave vents or gable vents, multiply the length by width of each vent to get the square inches, (if the opening is covered with a screen, divide by 2) The net free area may be stamped on the frame of the vent. Add up all the totals from all of the vents to get your total existing free air area. If there is not enough free air area in the attic, additional vents should be added to ensure that the attic fan is working at optimal efficiency. Do attic exhaust fans come with a thermostat? Yes. All attic exhaust fans are equipped with a thermostat. What temperature should the thermostat of an attic fan/ventilator be set on? Attic fan thermostats are usually set at about 110 degrees F., depending on the climate.<query> how to calculate free air in attic</query> If the fan seems to be running too much, raise the thermostat setting by 10 degrees. Can the dome of an attic ventilator be painted? If so, what kind of paint should be used? Yes. The dome may be painted with any latex-based exterior house paint. Can a variable speed control switch be used with an attic exhaust fan? The Broan model 72 variable speed control can be used with the Broan model 350, 353, 355, and 350 attic fans. (The model #356 cannot be used with a variable speed control.) Can a gable exhaust fan be installed on a roof? No. Gable fans are designed to be installed only on vertical locations. Do roof fans have bird guards installed? Yes. Bird screens are incorporated into the individual roof exhaust fans.<query> what kind of paint to use on an attic fan</query> Can a roof fan be installed on a vertical surface? No. Roof exhaust fans are designed to be installed on horizontal or sloping surfaces. Broan-NuTone gable fans are designed for vertical installations. Can an attic exhaust fan be installed on a flat roof? Yes. Note that a waterproof curb will need to be built so that the housing is higher and snow and water levels would not affect product performance. Can I install a dehumidistat to the attic ventilator? Yes. Use model DH100W by Broan. What is a “sone,” and how is it measured? A sone is a unit of measure for sound that refers to a comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the listening environment. One sone is the equivalent of a quiet refrigerator. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is ""sensed,"" including factors such as pitch and frequency.<query> what is sone</query> For example, the sound of a car equipped with speakers that produce very low bass notes can be extremely disagreeable more because of the vibration, than because of the actual volume of the music. back to top Exhaust Fans What is continuous ventilation? Continuous ventilation provides today’s tightly constructed homes with a relatively constant and controlled level of ventilation. Broan QT Series ventilators are very quiet and efficient and are ideally suited for these applications. Can Broan fans be mounted directly above a tub or shower? Most Broan fans are rated for use over a shower or bathtub when used with a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter). Can a ceiling fan be surrounded by insulation? Yes. Broan bath fans are designed to provide adequate cooling for motors and lighting, as well as products with integral heaters. Will Broan fans work in wall-mount applications?<query> what is broan ventilation</query> Some Broan bath and utility fans may be wall mounted. See the spec matrix for specific models. Can a ceiling fan or wall-mount utility fan serve as a kitchen range hood? No. Range hoods are specifically designed to handle grease and high temperature environments. Ventilation provided by NuTone fans is only a supplement for odor and moisture removal in the kitchen. What is ""static pressure""? Static pressure is a measure of resistance to airflow as it is pushed through ductwork. Static pressure reduces the effectiveness of the fan. Static pressure increases with the length and the number of turns in the ductwork. Learn more on the Home Ventilation Institute web site www.hvi.org. How long should a bath fan run after a shower is used? The Home Ventilation Institute recommends that a fan should run for 20 minutes to clear humidity adequately and to minimize moisture and condensation in the fan body and ducting.<query> what is the static pressure of a bathroom fan</query> Is there a timer available that will turn off a fan automatically after 20 minutes? Broan has sensing fans that detect the humidity rise caused by a shower and turn on automatically. When moisture has cleared it turns off. Some wall controls also give you the option of humidity sensing or timer control. What are the timer features? Delay-off timers automatically shut your fan off after a specified time interval. This is a useful feature in high traffic bathrooms where you may wish to let the fan run to clear moisture adequately. A timer counts the minutes of fan operation selected by the user. Where should the bathroom exhaust fan be located? Exhaust fans should be located in or near the shower or tub, and in any enclosed room with a toilet. Keep exhaust points opposite the supply air source to ensure that the fresh air is drawn through the room.<query> where should bathroom exhaust fan be located</query> Bathroom doors should not be sealed too tightly at the bottom in order to allow replacement air to enter the room when the door is closed. Where is the exhaust outlet on a ventilation fan? The exhaust outlet is the point where air is discharged through the body of the fan housing into the ductwork. During installation, the fan should be oriented with the exhaust outlet pointing toward the exit vent on the roof or wall to minimize turns in ductwork that impede airflow. Why do windows and mirrors fog up even when the fan is running? If windows and mirrors are cold, condensation can still form on these surfaces. If a bathroom is sealed tightly, replacement air may not be entering the room fast enough to displace the moist air. Fan placement can also be a factor. Fans should be located far enough from the source of replacement air to ensure the moist air is drawn out first.<query> why do bathroom fans fog up</query> Too many twists and turns in the ducting will significantly reduce the ability of the blower to remove moist air. Make sure that ductwork is as short and straight as possible, with gradual turns rather than tight corners where necessary. Why is water dripping from the grille of the fan? Dripping water can be caused by either condensation (usually due to cold ductwork or improper duct installation), or a problem with the seal on a wall or roof vent. Insulated ductwork can help solve condensation problems, and running the fan longer will ensure that moisture is completely removed from the duct. If possible, ductwork should slope down toward a wall vent to direct condensation out of the exterior vent opening rather than back into the fan housing. Can I install a heater directly over the bathtub or in a shower? No.<query> why does my shower fan drip water</query> Heaters are not UL listed (Underwriter's Laboratory) for installation over bathtubs or in a shower. Can I use an inline or multi-port fan in one large bathroom? Yes, this works the best for large rooms because you can install the ports over the areas where the ventilation is needed the most (source control). The size of the multi-port would be determined by the size of the room. Does a duct-free bath fan expel air? No. A duct-free fan only circulates the air in the room. It is not a ventilating device and does not remove air from the room. What type of exhaust fan is recommended for indoor sauna or hot tub areas? A high-CFM rated device is normally recommended for this type of application. Can I use a smaller diameter duct than what the fan is designed for?<query> can a bathtub fan be used over a shower</query> This is not recommended. Undersized ductwork will cause the fan to run harder, greatly reducing the CFM performance of the fan and create excess noise. Can larger diameter ducting be used with my bath fan? Yes, larger diameters ducting will improve the performance of your fan. What type of duct is recommended, rigid or flexible? Rigid ductwork is recommended, where possible. Rigid ductwork has less resistance to air flow and allows the fan to operate much more efficiently. If flexible ducting is used, be sure the duct is as straight as possible. Can a bathroom fan be vented into an attic instead of out the roof or wall? Never direct exhaust air into spaces within walls, ceilings, attics, crawl spaces or garages. The humidity may damage the structure and insulation. Can I use a fan in a steam shower?<query> what type of ductwork is used for bathroom fan</query> An open is when a circuit's path is disrupted. An overload is when current on a circuit is excessive. A short is when current takes an unintended path to ground (usually with very little resistance). A ground-fault is when such a short does not use the neutral as its path to ground. What is an open ground? An open neutral? Reverse polarity, etc.? Measured at an outlet's receptacle, the path (wire continuity) to the ground point in the panel can be disrupted or missing for the ground wire (open ground) or for the neutral (open neutral). When the path between the outlet and its circuit breaker is disrupted, this is an “open hot.” Reverse polarity (hot and neutral reversed) means neutral wires are connected to the side of the receptacle that is supposed to be for the hot, and vice versa.<query> what is an open ground</query> No. Since these are normally sealed chambers, a vacuum will be created. Can more than one bath fan be vented out of a single roof or wall cap? Usually not. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended ventilation requirements. back to top Ceiling Fans How high should ceiling fans be mounted from the floor? Typically want to install them 8 to 9 feet off the ground Ceiling Height 9’ 10’ 11’ 12’ 13’ 15’ Down rod Length 12” 18” 24” 36” 48” 72” back to top NuTone Central Vacuum What size power unit should I use? Power units are designed for different applications and for varying square footage requirements of residences. For greatest efficiency, place the power unit as low as possible in the system. How many inlets may be installed in a system?<query> how high should ceiling fans be mounted</query> It is recommended to keep the number of inlets to the minimum needed for convenient use. But you may install as many as you require, assuming all are in proper working condition with tight seals and gaskets. What inlets should be used? Depending on the application and the power unit model will dictate which inlets are utilized for the installation. Things to consider are styling and color. The Advantage Series offers a status indicating feature and Broan-NuTone also offers a direct connect electrified inlet. Where should I locate my wall inlet valves? If you are using one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses the wall valve inlets should be located within six feet of a household power receptacle. We suggest that you take a 25 foot length of cord or a measuring tape set to 25 feet then walk though your home and locate your wall inlets so that they cover all the areas you wish to vacuum.<query> where are the inlet valves located</query> Are Broan-NuTone Vacuum components compatible with other makes? Some Broan-NuTone's components may be compatible with other makes. Call Broan-NuTone Technical Support for verification before you buy any component. What are “air watts”? “Air watts” refers to a combination of air flow and vacuum water lift created by the power unit. The greater the air watts, the greater the cleaning ability of the system. Is it necessary to exhaust the power unit to the outside? For the best indoor air quality, Broan-NuTone recommends venting the exhaust to the outside. This is not mandatory, but is recommended for a complete installation. One advantage of a central vacuum system is its ability to vacuum up all items and microscopic particles that may not be captured by the primary filter (bag).<query> what is the difference between a vacuum and a central vacuum</query> The remaining particles will then be vented to outside through the exhaust duct. Can regular PVC plumbing be used for central vacuum tubing? No. Broan-NuTone uses special thin wall tubing that must be used to ensure proper fit of inlets, hoses and other components, and for proper operation of the system. What is cyclonic action? Cyclonic action is a special feature that forces dust and debris to the bottom of the power unit's canister, allowing the power unit to operate at peak effectiveness. What is the difference between Turbo powered vacuum cleaning heads and electric powered cleaning heads? Turbo powered heads use some of the power unit's suction to operate the cleaning head. The electric cleaning heads use all of the power unit's suction for cleaning. In order to use the electric cleaning heads you must use one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses.<query> what is cyclonic action</query> When is a power brush or power head required? Broan-NuTone recommends using a power brush to clean carpet. The power brush loosens dirt for proper cleaning and separates and lifts the nap of the carpet to keep it in top condition and proper appearance. Are the turbine air brushes operationally equivalent to the power brushes? Yes. The air-driven turbine is a uniquely designed, non-electric brush for cleaning with the central vacuum system. The electric power brush maintains constant brush action by using of the motor used to run the unit. Is a dedicated electrical circuit required for a central vacuum power unit installation? Yes. The central vacuum system requires its own 15 or 20 amp circuit, depending on the specific power unit you are installing. My central vacuum has lost a lot of its suction. What is the most likely cause?<query> what is the power brush for central vacuum</query> A dirty motor filter may be the cause of poor system performance. Other problems that cause poor system performance are leaky wall valve inlets, blockages in the intake or exhaust piping, or a blockage in the hose. Consult your owner’s manual or call Broan-NuTone Technical support for assistance. How do you remove the power unit’s motor filter? First remove the dust collection canister. After locating the motor filter, grasp the flexible band that holds the filter in place and then pull it to the center of the filter, and it should come free. If you have trouble call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. How can I clear a blockage in the vacuum system? Clearing a blockage in the system can be quite a challenge. You can rent a plumber's snake and then work it through the system piping. Sometimes a small diameter hose worked through your piping may clear a blockage.<query> how to remove motor filter</query> Why does the system keep running even when the hose is removed and the power unit's switch is turned off? The most likely cause is incorrect wiring to your wall valve inlets. Disengage one of the system wires on the front of your power unit and if the system shuts down then you need to verify that the wiring to your wall valve inlets is correct. If the problem persists, call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. back to top Service & Support Contact Support FAQs Video Library National Accounts Finance Credit Application Product Recalls Freight Claims Tax Exempt Forms Markets Construction Data Comm.

Voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when current is passed through the wire. Even the best conductors of electricity, such as copper wire, offer some resistance to the flow of current. This resistance causes a drop in voltage. The greater the resistance of the circuit, the higher the voltage drop. How much voltage drop is acceptable? A voltage drop of 5% at the furthest receptacle in a branch circuit is acceptable for normal efficiency. In a 120 volt, 15 amp circuit, this means that there should be no more than a 6 volt drop (114 volts) at the furthest outlet when the circuit is fully loaded. At what percentage voltage drop does a circuit become hazardous? That depends on several factors: The amount of current flowing through the high resistance connection The amount of resistance of that connection Proximity or contact with combustible materials Available air flow to dissipate heat What causes excessive voltage drop in a branch circuit?<query> what is the voltage drop in a circuit</query> Excessive voltage drop is usually caused by: High resistance connections at wiring junctions or outlet terminals, including: Poor splices anywhere in the circuit Loose or corroded connections anywhere in the circuit Inadequate seating of wire in the slot connection on push-in type receptacles and switches The wire does not meet code (i.e., not heavy enough gauge for the length of the run). What are the consequences of excess voltage drop in a circuit? Excess voltage drop can cause: Inadequate power, causing improper, erratic or no operation—and damage to the equipment being powered. Poor efficiency and wasted energy. Build-up of heat at the high resistance connection or splice, which may be a fire hazard. What is the difference between a switch and a circuit breaker? A switch is a device that interrupts the flow of electricity.<query> what is the cause of voltage drop</query>"

Nick Fadugba,AFRAA Secretary General described the ban as “undermining international confidence in African aviation “ making European carriers the “ultimate beneficiaries” who will dominate the African skies to the disadvantage of African carriers! With 111 carriers from 13 African countries banned, the list does indeed undermine African aviation; travellers will obviously consider flying major carriers like KLM/AF or Lufthansa at the expense of the ‘unsafe’ African carriers!<query> which airlines are safe in africa</query> The list was particularly ruthless with African airlines. So what criteria did the EU use to issue its unilateral verdict? It crystallises into 3 major points: Use of poorly maintained, obsolete aircraft(Criteria used to ban most African airlines with old soviet era fleet) Inability of airlines to rectify shortcomings identified during inspections by EU Air Safety Committee. Inability of a civil aviation authority responsible for overseeing an airline to perform its task properly(Criteria was used to ban all airlines from Sudan, Iran) African airlines face safety challenges due to poor infrastructure; lack of capacity, poor oversight and policies and unhealthy finances that impede rapid fleet modernization. Also, according to David Learmount, Flight International Operations and Safety Editor, African airlines do not have the “luxury of a safety culture“ since less developed countries tend to have less emphasis on a strong safety culture in the airline operations!Africa aviation is often associated with the ""Flying Coffins"",old Soviet era Antonov aircraft with notorious safety records!<query> why did the eu issue its unilateral verdict</query> An Antonov 225 In spite of the challenges, several African airlines have earned IATA’s IOSA Certification, a global standard for airline safety management.

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree. I would like to take flying lessons but as I am stationed in England (not to mention my newborn baby), it's seemingly impossible right now.<query> what is the scope of a plane</query> Well that's enough about me. Basically I just have these few questions: 1. What education level is required, or preferred, to fly the ""big iron""? 2. Do most pilots start out flying small props to gain flying hours, or do some airlines offer a training program to start you out on jetliners? 3. As I am 27 now, does that somewhat hamper me because of my late start? 4. Do you have just any general tips for me to follow to achieve my newfound dream of becoming and airline pilot? Nash Hi Nash, 1. To be a pilot, a degree is preferable but not an absolute requirement. It depends on the Airlines. The Cadet Pilot or Airline Sponsorship Program is very competitive and usually the cream is selected.<query> what is the education level to become an airline pilot</query> For instance, in one recent advert for sponsorship in UK (they have stopped this program today), there were 40,000 applications for the 100 positions available. However, not all is lost if you do not meet the stringent entry requirements. In your case, are you able to change your trade to become an Air Force pilot to gain some flying experience? Most flying jobs in the military would require a college degree although there are a few exceptions. Your military flying hours are usually recognized in civil aviation. Once you have accumulated sufficient flying hours in the Air Force, enroll yourself into a Commercial Pilot's License course first. When your term with the Air Force expires, you would most likely be ready to seek employment in the civil sector as a co pilot in a multiengine transport airplane. You will have to work your way from the bottom of the ladder but you will not regret for you will learn a lot on the right hand seat.<query> how to become an air force pilot</query> Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License. Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer it take. jawed nasim , 14 Jun, 2010 +0 is becoming a pilot a big problem...? not at all....!!! hi friends, now its very easy to become pilot.. become a pilot with 200 hrs flying exp.

The second thing to do is to take a trial lesson to see if you really like that environment and you feel comfortable doing this as a career, i.e. you if you want to become a pilot. Of course if you are young, then talking to the family will help, and getting their support will be important for your flying career. Also, try to learn as much as much as possible about flying and aircrafts. Learning to fly is an expensive business unless you are luck enough to be chosen for the air force to be trained as a military pilot or get selected for one of the very few airline sponsorship programs. So knowing what to expect in becoming a pilot is very important to reduce the flying training costs.

clueweb12-0309wb-83-27220,29,1,"Thirsty and/or hot? Stop by Ice Station Cool for a chance to get out of the hot Florida sun, and to try soft drinks from the world over for free. It is a great way to cool off and get some refreshments. (This is the ""ice cave"" located near Innoventions West.) If you or your children like animals, visit The Living Seas pavilion. It is the largest saltwater aquarium in the world. You can see dolphins, seals, tons of fish, sharks, and many other sea creatures. Nothing wild here, except the wildlife! As for World Showcase, my best recommendation would be to explore every country. There is so much to take in here. For rides and/or attractions, do not miss the following: El Rio del Tiempo in Mexico, The American Adventure, and any show in the America Gardens Theater.<query> what is the world showcase</query> If you have little mouseketeers, there are KIDCOT FUNSTOPS set up in every country. Here, kids can do all kinds of fun things with Cast Members. At night be sure to see Illuminations: Reflections of Earth laser light and fireworks display. World Showcase is the perfect place to enjoy a theme park without having to face a lot of thrill rides. ------------------------ DISNEY-MGM STUDIOS ------------------------ When you are in the Disney-MGM Studios your best choices are ones without the explosions, scary aliens, or names like ""Catastrophe Canyon."" One of the top attractions offered is Muppet Vision 3-D. It is a hilarious look at Kermit and the gang's attempt at a 3-D movie -- nothing really scary or wild here, although it does tend to get a bit loud. You will find a lot of good, tame attractions in the Studios, many of which appeal in particular to fearful little ones (although grown-ups can enjoy them too).<query> what is the best disney mgm attraction</query> They include Playhouse Disney Live on Stage, featuring Bear in the Big Blue House, Rolie Polie Olie, Stanley and Pooh, and Voyage of the Little Mermaid, a multimedia version of the Disney tale. Next visit Beauty and the Beast, Live on Stage. There is even an arcade and pizza place, Toy Story Pizza Planet Arcade. ----------------------- ANIMAL KINGDOM ----------------------- I visited Animal Kingdom for the first time about six months ago. It has risen to a tie with Epcot as my favorite park, and I have yet to see everything. My descriptions of attractions within this park are going to be very generic, as I do not want to give away the surprises that await you. The first thing you must do upon entering the most amazing creation (in my opinion) that Disney has ever undertaken is visit The Tree of Life.<query> what is the name of the disney park</query> All I will say is make sure your camera is ready to go! After Tree of Life, venture over to Camp Minnie-Mickey Character Greeting Trails. Here you will find Mickey, Minnie, and friends waiting to say hello and take some pictures with guests. Two good shows for everyone to visit are Festival of the Lion King and Pocahontas and her Forest Friends. These are among the most magical shows in the park. Festival of the Lion King is a wonderful spectacle featuring the music of the movie, while Pocahontas is a live animal show about conservation. Even though DinoLand, USA has the rollicking Dinosaur ride and the wild Primeval Whirl, it also hosts several tamer attractions. For kids, there's The Boneyard playground, and even adults can have a good time at Chester and Hester's DinoRama. They can even go for a spin on the Dumbo-like TriceraTop Spin and play several carnival style games.<query> what is the best place to visit in dinoland</query> (I visited DinoRama during my most recent trip and have to admit, at the age of 30, I had fun.) Four absolute musts in Animal Kingdom are: Kilimanjaro Safaris, Wildlife Express Train to Rafiki's Planet Watch, Rafiki's Planet Watch and Maharajah Jungle Trek. Again, so that I do not give too much away, make certain the camera is ready to go. Stop by the petting zoo to see the animals. In the afternoon jam with Mickey and friends in Mickey's Jammin' Jungle Parade. ----------------------- TOP 10 LISTS ----------------------- Here's my list of the top 10 best rides/attractions for wimps: 1) Tree of Life - Animal Kingdom 2) Kilimanjaro Safaris - Animal Kingdom 3) Spaceship Earth - Epcot 4) Tomorrowland Transit Authority - Magic Kingdom 5) Mickey's PhilharMagic - Magic Kingdom 6) Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Maharajah Jungle Trek - Animal Kingdom 8) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 9) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 10) World Showcase - Epcot My suggestions for the best rides/attractions for not-so-bold youngsters: 1) Playhouse Disney Live on Stage - Disney-MGM Studios 2) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 3) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 4) Mickey's Toontown Fair - Magic Kingdom 5)<query> what is the best ride in animal kingdom</query> The Boneyard - Animal Kingdom 6) The petting zoo in Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Dumbo the Flying Elephant - Magic Kingdom 8) Cinderella's Golden Carrousel - Magic Kingdom 9) Camp Minnie-Mickey - Animal Kingdom 10) KIDCOT Funstops throughout World Showcase in Epcot I hope that any of you who have been concerned about being a ride ""wimp,"" or about not being able to have fun without riding all the rides, are now feeling a bit more at ease. If an attraction is not mentioned, it does not necessarily mean I consider it a bad choice. This article was based on my opinions of what people like myself (who don't like wild and crazy rides) would feel comfortable about trying while on vacation in Disney World. So, yes, you can be a ""wimp"" and still have the time of your life in the happiest place on earth.<query> what rides are in animal kingdom</query> Enjoy! == = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Kelly, a 30-year-old Winnie the Pooh fan from New Jersey, made her first trip to WDW in 1979 -- when she was just 5!

But what if you're like me, and you don't enjoy the ""wild"" rides? You know, the ones that spin around at dizzying speeds, that make you feel ill, or hang you upside down? Is it possible for those of us who are ride ""wimps"" to still have a good time at Walt Disney World? Now, don't be offended by my use of the word ""wimp."" By ""wimp,"" I mean you are like me -- the type of person who loves amusement parks, but a carousel is about as wild and crazy as you are willing to get. For people like us, adult and children alike, the idea of being dropped 13 stories faster than you can say ""Mickey Mouse"" holds no appeal.<query> what is the name of the rides at disney world</query> The more I thought about this recently, the more I began to wonder whether I was the only Disney Wimp out there. Maybe there are many others like me, or maybe there are parents who would love to bring their children to Disney World, but are unsure of what rides and attractions are suitable. Well, fear not! I am going to give you park by park recommendations of the rides and attractions I find easygoing for everyone. I may even clear up some confusion about attractions whose names sound scary but really aren't. (For years I shivered at the very idea of going on the Haunted Mansion in the Magic Kingdom. One day, my mother said, ""But it's not scary, it's actually funny."" So I swallowed my fears, only to learn that once again mother did know best.)<query> what rides are fun for kids at disney world</query> Yes, you can be a wimp when it comes to rides and attractions, and have the time of your life in WDW. ------------------------ MAGIC KINGDOM ------------------------ You will be pleased to know that you have to travel no further than right inside the Magic Kingdom to find the first ride that is wonderful for us wimps: The Walt Disney World Railroad. This is a great ride for everyone as it travels slowly around the perimeter of the park. Riders can ride the train for the whole trip or get off at different stations (Main Street USA, Frontierland, and Mickey's Toontown Fair). In Tomorrowland you will find one of the best rides for older children and adults: Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin. OK, before you run to hide under Andy's bed at the thought of going on a ride with the word ""spin"" in it, read on.<query> what rides are in disney world</query> This is a ride/ game where you get to control how much your vehicle spins. What could be better? This ride is great for most children, though some little kids may not be able to see well and some may be frightened of the aliens. All in all, no matter if you are a little or big kid, this is a lot of fun. While walking through Tomorrowland, you may notice blue vehicles traveling above the park. Do not be afraid of this ride, which is known as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (or the TTA to seasoned travelers). I know many of you are thinking, ""What do you mean travel above the park?"" Relax! Once you realize how beautiful the park is from that height, and how nice it is to be seated for 15 minutes, you will love the TTA.<query> what is the tta ride</query> Plus, you can say you went into Space Mountain without ever having to ride it. (The TTA travels through the Space Mountain building for about one minute). If you are lucky enough that the Carousel of Progress is operational during your stay, you must not miss it. A good number of adults may recognize this from the 1964 World's Fair. It is a wonderful look at the progress in our world from the turn of the 20th century to the start of the 21st century. After visiting Tomorrowland, go to Fantasyland, where there are a number of good attractions just for us wimps. Head for It's a Small World, which is a great choice. How can you resist a boat ride featuring singing and dancing dolls and animals? (Editor's Note: You'll have to wait until spring 2005, though --<query> what to do in tomorrowland</query> It's a Small World is closed until then for a rehab!) Then go right across the way to Peter Pan's Flight. The only scary thing about this one is how long you will have to wait without a FASTPASS. This ride takes you on a magical journey over London just like Peter, Wendy, and the children did in the story. One of my favorite rides in the Magic Kingdom also happens to be another great choice for wimps: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Riders are loaded into Honey Pots for their journey into the Hundred Acre Wood to visit with Pooh and friends. A new and awesome attraction debuted in Fantasyland in the fall of 2003: Mickey's PhilharMagic. This attraction is a 3-D show unlike any you have seen before. Using the largest projection screen in the world and brand new 3-D technology, Disney brings it to life like only they can.<query> what rides are in magic kingdom</query> Enjoy a funny, musical performance with Mickey, Donald, and all the gang. Little children seem to have a mixed reaction to this show, possibly because of the loudness, so use your own judgment. Two of the tamest rides, which are really good choices for younger kids, are Cinderella's Golden Carrousel and Dumbo the Flying Elephant. Most little children love carrousels and choosing their own horse to ride on. And even though Dumbo goes up in the air, riders can control how high they go. Don't neglect Liberty Square while on your tour. Here you will find the aforementioned Haunted Mansion. I promise it isn't really that scary, except perhaps for those who have a fear of the dark. Visit the Hall of Presidents for a calm show which features every president of the United States. Last but not least, wimps should be sure to stay for the Share A Dream Come True parade, Spectromagic parade, and the Wishes fireworks.<query> what is the tamest rides in the world</query> (If someone in your party does not like loud noises, I would advise skipping Wishes.) Share a Dream Come True is one of the most beautiful parades I have seen. ------------------------ EPCOT ------------------------ In Epcot, you come across one of my favorite rides, Spaceship Earth. This attraction is inside the huge gleaming globe that is the symbol of Epcot. You will travel, at a slow pace, through the history of communication. After Spaceship Earth, venture toward The Land pavilion, as this offers some good options for wimps. In this pavilion you will find the gentle boat ride Living with the Land, which offers you a behind the scenes look at agriculture and how Disney and NASA are working together on better ways to grow food. (It may sound boring but it really isn't.) You will also find the entertaining and educational Circle of Life movie starring Timon and Pumbaa from the Lion King.<query> what is the name of the boat ride at epcot</query>"

Selby's New & Improved Better Value Bracket This bracket is new to Selby for our 2012 range and features several improvements over most slimline tilt brackets.<query> what size bracket for tv</query> For example, some slimline tilt brackets slowly tilt forwards due to the strain of supporting large TVs, but this bracket features a stronger tilt mechanism which prevents slippage. This bracket also allows you to tilt the screen both downwards AND upwards, which helps with connecting cables. Slimline brackets allow your TV to sit very close to the wall, but that usually makes it very difficult to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV. Being able to tilt the screen upwards can provide you with much easier access to your TV's connections. Designed for Australian Homes This range of brackets is designed to suit the stud spacings of Australian homes. This PLB131L fits perfectly across two 600mm-spaced studs (Australian standard). Slimline Bracket for Thin TVs This is a slimline bracket which sits closer to the wall than most other tilting brackets.<query> what is the tilt bracket for tv</query> It is designed for use with the ultra slim LED screens, but is also suitable for use with LCDs and Plasmas. Please note that some manufacturers recommend that LCDs and plasmas are not to be mounted within a certain distance from the wall, due to heat and ventilation concerns. If unsure, check your user manual or contact the manufacturer. Vertical Tilting Action This bracket offers a +/- 15 degree tilt. Perfect if you wish to mount your TV high on the wall and tilt it down, for example in the bedroom (or in the presence of curious young children with sticky hands!). Downwards tilt can also help to avoid getting annoying reflections on the screen, while upwards tilt makes it much easier to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV.

The Friction-Free Economy offers up some entertaining, if not enlightening, notions November 1997 Abstract What are the forces that govern today's high-tech marketplace? Forget about those economic theories you learned in school: Adams, or Keynes, or even Karl Marx have no place in Silicon Valley, according to T.G. Lewis. He tries to answer this question in his new book,The Friction-Free Economy: Marketing Strategies for a Wired World (2,600 words). Mail this article to a friend n his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates made a statement that I found so apt that it appears in my standard marketing presentation on electronic commerce: ""[The Internet] will carry us into a new world of low-friction, low-overhead capitalism, in which market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low."" That phrase sums up the essence of T.G. Lewis's breezy, slapdash book,The Friction-Free Economy: Marketing Strategies for a Wired World.<query> how has the internet changed the rules on business and economics?</query> The Internet/intranet market contains many factors, including all of the types of vendors mentioned above as well as other things like availability of worthwhile content, bandwidth, and cultural acceptance. You could use chaos theory to figure out when markets and market shares of Netscape, Sun, and other vendors are sufficient to make the ""Internet"" value chain stable. Netscape's meteoric rise was perhaps the one factor that pushed the entire value chain into prominence. We can say that although the positions of various vendors in the Internet value chain may wax, wane, or blink out completely over time, the overall market and value chain is relatively stable, moving toward some strange attractor that we will eventually discover. (Installed base? Total sales? Market capitalization? Lewis doesn't specify.) This is all fascinating stuff, but Lewis stops short of supplying any depth or detail in his analysis.<query> what is the internet value chain</query> Although he does show examples of how chaos theory can apply to predicting stock prices, it would have been more interesting to show exactly how chaos theory applies to technology-driven value chains like the Internet. The New Lanchester Strategy The same lack of detail pervades other tantalizing parts ofThe Friction-Free Economy. Another example is Lewis's exposition of something he calls the New Lanchester Strategy. The New Lanchester Strategy is derived from the work of Frederick William Lanchester, an early 20th century British scientist and engineer whose theories of combat became major influences in the fields of operations research and, through W. Edwards Deming's (misspelled in the book as ""W. Edward Deming"") Total Quality Management. As Lewis puts it, Lanchester's theories of weapons and troop strength can be applied to sales and marketing in the friction-free economy.<query> who developed the new lanchester strategy</query> When adapted in this way, participants in a market fall into four categories: monopolist, leader, player, and non-player. He goes through examples of these categories, and how to use them, from the PC industry. But first, he defines these categories in terms of market share: 0 to 26.1 percent share means you're not a player; 26.1 to 41.7 percent means you are a player; 41.7 to 73.9 makes you a leader; and more than 73.9 percent means you have a monopoly. Where did he (or Lanchester) get these numbers? We never find out -- not even a brief explanation. It would be especially interesting to compare Lewis/Lanchester's scheme with Geoffrey Moore's taxonomy, from his book Inside the Tornado (reviewed in SunWorld, August 1996), that involves Gorillas, Chimps, and Monkeys (roughly speaking, a gorilla is a leader or monopolist, a chimp is a player, and a monkey is below player level).<query> what is the difference between a monopolist and a player</query> Moore describes his levels of competitor in terms of qualitative behavior in the marketplace, whereas Lewis claims some sort of hard statistical derivation of his categories. Unfortunately, we never find out where that derivation comes from. Another important ramification of the bits-based, friction-free economy is that it enables marketing techniques like mass customization, one-to-one marketing, and narrowcasting. The best elucidators of these trends are Don Peppers and Martha Rogers inThe One to One Future (see Bill's Bookshelf, March 1997) and their other books. Lewis doesn't seem to have read them. If you believe Peppers's and Rogers's point of view, then Lewis is confusing target marketing with one-to-one marketing. The former means breaking down the space of customers, by demographics or psychographics, into smaller and smaller groups.<query> who is the author of one to one marketing</query> The latter deals with individuals only and does analysis bottom-up, measuring share of customer (how much business does he or she give you over time) rather than share of market (how many customers do you have). This distinction may seem like merely semantic nitpicking, but Peppers and Rogers make a convincing case that the two require fundamentally different analysis techniques, organizational structures, and systems to make them work. Lewis doesn't see that difference. At the same time, the more important point is that in the friction-free market, individually targeted offerings become easy to manufacture. Lewis says, quite correctly, that the ""wired world"" makes it possible to customize products and services to individuals -- or small qualified groups -- with very little overhead, certainly far short of what it would take to modify a factory assembly line.<query> what is the difference between bottom up and friction free market</query> How to kill a giant The best part of this book is one of the last chapters, called ""How to Kill a Giant."" (The ""teeth-to-butt"" quote actually comes from that chapter.) In it, Lewis discusses attempts to beat the past and present giants of the computer business, IBM and Microsoft. He outlines four different strategies for overtaking market leaders: Brute Force, Momentum, Anti-Monopoly, and Pure. Unfortunately, Lewis never really explains what the brute force play is, except to illustrate it by example (Iomega beating SyQuest in the removable storage device sweepstakes). The momentum play means accelerating ""around"" the competition to obtain a larger market share. The example he gives of momentum play is that of the Network Computer, where Oracle, Netscape, Sun, IBM, and others are building a base of support for the NC that they hope will go around Microsoft/Intel's PC to become the dominant low-end computing platform.<query> what is momentum play</query> Notice that the momentum play primarily involvesmarket share and a value proposition for the product, rather than pricing issuesper se. The NC's value proposition does involve product price (an NC for $500), but it also involves ease of administration and lowered total cost of ownership. Lewis uses two examples to illustrate the anti-monopoly play: one unsuccessful (PowerPC vs. Intel) and one that might become successful (Java vs. Windows). Litigation is one of the tools he lists as useful in the anti-monopoly play; he considers litigation to be a tactic that helps but never fully succeeds in giant-killing. This perspective is especially interesting in light of Sun's recent decision to sue Microsoft over the terms of the Java license. His views on how the Internet is bringing society back to a ""tribal"" culture are harder to digest than they are to believe The pure-play strategy involves focusing, planning, and executing flawlessly.<query> what is the momentum play</query> It's what Microsoft has done with Windows and Sun has done with its servers. Lewis chooses a poor example for this one: Corel's PerfectOffice suite. It's unfortunate as explanation, because what Michael Cowpland (the CEO) is doing at Corel seems to resemble a brute force play more than a pure play. (Plus, given 20-20 hindsight, Lewis is wrong in his assertion that Corel is taking back the office-suite application market from Microsoft. PerfectOffice achieved notable sales volume only through the dubious practice known as ""channel stuffing,"" and Corel recently announced its decision to cease development on the much anticipated 100% pure Java office suite. At this point in time, Corel looks like it is in big trouble again.) The ""How to Kill a Giant"" chapter offers some clear thinking and a useful framework for companies as they seek to overtake market leaders.<query> who is the ceo of corel</query> Elsewhere in the book, Lewis's thinking and advice are not so clear or useful. His views on how the Internet is bringing society back to a ""tribal"" culture, and how tribalism relates to mass-customized products and services, are harder to digest than they are to believe. Another example: his definition of ""prosumption"" is just plain wrong. Prosumption is generally defined asproducers and consum ers collaborating on product/service production; the canonical example being a customized daily news service where the user specifies what kinds of things she wants to read. Lewis uses ""pyramid"" marketers, like HerbaLife and Amway, to define prosumption simply because those organizations' middle-tier members both buy and sell products. Lewis wanted to illustrate how businesses like these can become more efficient by using the Internet. This may be true, but I would suggest that if he wants to use a technical term for the way they do business,superdistribution is more applicable than prosumption.<query> what is prosumption</query> The Friction-Free Economy is a good piece of reading, on trains, planes, or stationary bicycles, for someone who isn't familiar with the work of its influencers. It's probably worthwhile to seek out T.G. Lewis when he is giving a lecture -- he's undoubtedly a dynamic, entertaining speaker. But it's better to invest the time in reading the works of Davidow, Moore, Gilder, Peppers and Rogers, and others to get a deeper foundation in marketing strategies for the Wired Age.

He wanted to write ""an entertaining account."" In that, he has succeeded.

His writing style is filled with cutesy puns and alliterations, crass metaphors, and other low-rent rhetorical devices. Here is a sample paragraph (with italics included): Young and aggressive businesses start out with a very low teeth-to-butt ratio. These young wolves aspire to become lions by chewing their way across the Chasm on the way to mainstreaming. Being of limited teeth, wolves hunt in packs and bring down their prey by outrunning and outnumbering them. They have less butt, and less teeth -- not too much of either one -- but they are on their way to getting more of both. The ""Chasm"" refers to marketing guru Geoffrey Moore's concept of the gap in market acceptance between the small number of ""early adopters,"" who like to adopt the latest technology, and the large, highly lucrative mainstream.<query> who is geoffrey lewis</query> Lewis makes liberal use of Moore's material, as well as that of other business and technology visionaries like George Gilder, Alvin Toffler, Bill Davidow, Peppers and Rogers, and probably others -- but sometimes he does this without attribution of any kind. This book suffers from various editing problems. Several factual errors were left in (e.g., representing Microsoft chief strategist Nathan Myhrvold as ""Cameron Myhrvold,"" and various misspellings, such as the name of Larry Ellison's Savile Row tailor). Charts and graphs look too simple -- their curves too smooth, the distinction between actual and estimated data not made clear -- and their placement is often too far from references to them in the text. All of these problems obscure the substance of the book. This is too bad, because theThe Friction-Free Economy is largely an intelligent exposition of topics related to how the Internet changes many rules of economics and business.<query> what is the friction free economy</query> Lewis begins with a basic explanation of three of the most important economic theories: Adam Smith's 18th-century free-market capitalism, Karl Marx' 19th-century socialism, and John Maynard Keynes's 20th-century synthesis of the two. He does this in order to show how the ""wired world"" is engendering a new type of economics where none of these theories hold. A basic principle of modern economics is that supply and demand counterbalance each other, acting like an ""invisible hand"" to produce equilibria in markets and stability in a company's market share. According to Smith, the equilibrium point is one at which products are what everyone needs and prices are affordable. Marx disagreed, saying that without heavily regulated markets, the equilibrium point is one at which wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small number of rich people.<query> what is the basic principle of economics</query> Finally, Keynes proved through mathematical means that, in a sense, both Smith and Marx were right: There are two possible equilibria, and a given economy can end up at either one depending on a variety of factors.

A corollary is that, because the spread of information feeds on itself, a product can enter a positive feedback loop that results in ever-increasing market share. This has many interesting consequences for vendors of software and other bits-based products. Most notably, price is no longer the most important factor in determining financial viability and market trajectory of a product. Two things are more important: thevalue that a product adds as part of avalue chain, where other links in the chain may be supplied by other vendors, and the market share that a product has among its competitors who occupy the same link in the value chain. An example that Lewis cites to illustrate this and many other points is the rise of the Internet/intranet market, thanks to vendors like Netscape. ""Internet"" turns out to be a value chain that includes Web servers, routers, server software, browsers, search engines, Web site development tools, and so on.<query> why is price important</query> Netscape has many products that fit into this value chain, but by no means all of them -- servers come from Sun and others, routers from Cisco and Bay Networks, search engines from Lycos and InfoSeek, development tools from Wallop and Kiva, etc. Lewis observes that changes in things like adoption of a certain technology or a company's market share are governed by chaos theory instead of by traditional predictive mathematical models In order to play in this value chain, Netscape must get sufficient market share for its value chain links (products and services). That's why Netscape gave away its browser for a while before charging for it: to build the value chain to sufficiently attractive size and get enough market share of a particular link in the chain to assure longevity of theentire chain, while placing itself on a trajectory toward browser market dominance.<query> what is netscape's value chain</query> Conversely, as Lewis observes, Apple failed because it did not understand the idea of the value chain and how to fit into it. Instead, Apple insisted on remaining a vertically-integrated hardware and software company and built marketing strategies based largely on pricing. As another example, IBM began an extremely important value chain by opening the PC design to clone manufacturers, but it did not take sufficient steps to build market share as the value chain came into being. Another theoretical basis for the friction-free economy is that new, murky branch of mathematics called ""chaos theory."" Lewis observes that changes in things like adoption of a certain technology or a company's market share are governed by chaos theory instead of by traditional predictive mathematical models. Chaos theory is neither particularly easy to define nor completely understood, but for these purposes, its importance is that it divides quantity movements over time into three categories -- stable, chaotic stability (volatile but within limits), and true chaos (""off the scale"" to infinity or zero) -- and that stable or chaotically stable quantities converge on fixed points called ""strange attractors."" The key to using chaos theory to predict market behavior is to understand when a measured quantity -- such as a vendor's market share -- makes the transition from one of those three states to another in a system of many different contributing factors.<query> what is the theory of chaos</query>"

IT Software Strategy S/W Dev Tools & Tips Tech Trends Expert Insight Feature RSS Multicore Platforms Virtualization Cloud Computing Security Parallel Programming Open Source/Linux Mobile Software Tech Trends Where Do Ultrabook Devices Fit In? By: Tim Kridel email facebook addthis ""Sexy"" might not be the first adjective that comes to mind when thinking about enterprise-grade notebooks, but that's howsome reviews are describing the first generation ofUltrabook devices. The initial models -- from vendors such as Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, LG and Toshiba -- shipped in late 2011, and in 2012 Intel believes there will be 75 Ultrabook devices announced or available. The Ultrabook design is less about a checklist of must-meet specs -- which Intel says are under NDA with vendors -- and more about delivering certain types of user experiences.<query> where do ultrabooks fit in</query> It identifies installed apps that use permissions that could be dangerous, and provides remote locating and locking.

All Rights Reserved<query> what is the software tool for xp</query> For example, all Ultrabook devices must be able to wake up in less than seven seconds so users always have immediate access to both content stored on their Ultrabook and Web-based data. Those abilities come, respectively, viaIntel’s Rapid Start and Smart Connect technologies . [Disclosure: Intel is the sponsor of this content.] “It’s extremely convenient,” says ​Brian Pitstick, executive director of laptop marketing for consumers and SMBs at Dell, whose initial Ultrabook is the XPS 13. “Smart Connect allows the device to periodically wake up while it’s asleep and refresh the content. So as you open it up, within seconds, you have updated content.” Those abilities could help make Ultrabook devices attractive to enterprises that are using or considering tablets, whose always-on design helps boost productivity. “One thing we’ve heard from the users who have done that is that one of the major purchase drivers is lightweight, easy to take with me, highly convenient in terms of instant on,” Pitstick says.<query> what is the intel smart connect</query> “We believe we’re delivering on that with this device. At the same time, customers say they want to stay productive, and in a lot of cases, productivity requires a keyboard, [Microsoft] Office compatibility and the right performance. That’s what makes it a different proposition than a tablet.” Bring Your Own Ultrabook If Ultrabook devices are known for anything so far, it’s their thin, light designs. The Toshiba Portégé Z830, for example, weighs less than 2.5 pounds and is 0.63 inch thick. If that svelte figure makes Ultrabook devices popular with consumers, that’s another way they could wind up in the enterprise. “The Ultrabook is a poster child BYOB (bring your own box) PC,” says Rob Enderle, principal analyst atEnderle Group. Some vendors are designing their Ultrabook devices to support that kind of scenario.<query> what is the ultrabook</query> “We do things like add a TPM chip so it has data-encryption security capabilities,” Pitstick says. “We have custom-configuration services [so] IT administrators can get custom images, BIOS settings, asset tags, things like that. Bringing any kind of device into an enterprise environment can cause a lot of headaches for IT. So with this class of device, we’ve thought about capabilities that would ease those concerns.” When it’s the enterprise buying the Ultrabook, it’s important to scrutinize the specs and try it out first. That’s standard advice for any notebook, but it’s particularly valuable for Ultrabook devices because their svelte designs force vendors to get creative in areas such as durability and battery life. “Think through what the minimums are in terms of a feature set you’ll allow into the enterprise and make sure that spec is communicated well,” Enderle says.<query> why is it important to test an ultrabook</query> “Some Ultrabook [devices] have brighter displays and may work better outdoors, suggesting that when that is a requirement, even the screen performance (measured in nits) should be given as a selection criteria. “This really is a class of product that varies a great deal vendor to vendor. The buyer should try a variety of offerings before making their decision to determine which feature set, feel and appearance works best for them.” New Market Opportunities? If their thin, light designs encourage consumers and business users to carry an Ultrabook in more places, they could create new opportunities to make or save money. For example, a growing number of vendors offer cloud-based video conferencing services that support a wide variety of endpoint types, from high-end telepresence rooms down to PCs, smart phones and tablets.<query> why ultrabooks are thin</query> For some users, participating in a video conference with a 10-inch tablet or a 3.5-inch smart phone might feel cramped -- to the point that they avoid using those services, undermining productivity. With screen sizes between 11 inches and 14 inches, Ultrabook devices could be big enough to provide a good video conferencing user experience in hotel rooms, home offices and airport lounges. And as full-fledged PCs, Ultrabook devices also would enable collaboration such as file sharing, something that’s difficult on a tablet or smart phone. “You want to be able to share and create while you’re talking,” Pitstick says. “Having the processing capability, the PC compatibility and keyboard becomes pretty important.” The same benefits also could enable enterprises to offer a wider range of services aimed at mobile consumers, particularly those who don’t want to carry a heavy notebook or struggle to make do with a tablet or smartphone.<query> what is the screen size of an ultrabook</query> “What we often hear on the customer side is most people who buy laptops leave them in the home,” Pitstick says. “When it’s easier to take outside the house, I think you’ll start to see more people take it outside the house. Maybe they’re a whole new segment of devices purchased as a result.” Read more about: IT Software Strategy email facebook addthis Tim Kridel has been covering all things tech and telecom since 1998 for a variety of publications and analyst firms.

What does it cost to live in an iconic neighborhood? By Roger Fillion of SwitchYard Media Haight-Ashbury has its hippies. Beverly Hills has its movie stars. And the Las Vegas Strip has its blackjack tables. Nice neighborhoods abound across the United States. But only a handful can claim to be world-famous.

If he’s the biggest (Major League ready) piece you give up (save Werth, of course) for the chance for Halladay/Hamels/Haren for the next three years, I’d take that risk. As for Cosart and Colvin…we wouldn’t be giving up both, just one. It’s awesome they look so good right now, but they’ve still got a ways to progress before they get to the majors. This isn’t Drabek, who this time last year looked like he’d be ready for a 2010 callup…it’ll be a little while before they’re ready. The Phils have low-level arms. To get Haren, one would be expendable.<query> who is the biggest starter you give up</query> by Aphilfan on Jul 24, 2010 3:28 PM EDT up reply actions A cost-controlled 4/5 starter, who, though clearly lucky, managed to get by hitters pretty damn well. If he even approaches another season like that, at his cost, which is basically nothing, he’s worth a good bit. And I just dislike giving up one of the two A-level aces, as just imagining a 2014 squad headed by both of them would be something, eh? But Haren strengthens us enough for the next few years, I guess it really is a good value. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 3:49 PM EDT up reply actions Agredd….a 4/5 starter and unknowns for a proven top flight starter is a no doubter to me.

Finally, Oswalt has been just under a 5 win player over the past 9.5 seasons, though most of that happened more than a couple years ago. I just don’t see how Haren is NOT the better choice, if we have one? by EJL on Jul 24, 2010 12:08 PM EDT up reply actions Oh he clearly is.<query> how many wins has haren won</query> It’s just everyone wonders what the Dbacks want for him. He’s available, but is it a good amount, or a crazy amount? by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 12:23 PM EDT up reply actions RAJ Decision Process Over at Broad Street Nation, we have been gnashing our teeth at Paul Holmgren’s (lack of) decision process. With RAJ, we’ve noticed he tends to take a “decide-now” way of doing business. Do analysis, then immediately act on the decision. Sometimes this works well….like saying PTB, thanks for the memories, see ya. Other times, like in the Lee trade, not so well. Here, I am concerned RAJ has “locked in” to Oswalt..or whoever. It is really important in this context, especially if ownership has decided on a strict budget (no, even from a profitability point of view, this is probably a bad idea, but that’s off-topic right now) that there is “out of the box” thinking.<query> what is raj decision process</query> This isn’t easy for someone with a Stanford engineering degree. Note I am not knocking Stanford per se, but someone from Stanford, and especially someone with an engineering degree, tends to the logical pure analysis way of doing business. Of course, that rationality plus the occasional Stanford ethos/elitism yields our RAJ smug-meter. Here, I think besides Haren (totally agree on all the posts about Haren being a better option worth the extra trade amount) RAJ ought to be thinking about other options. Like Brett Myers (yes, eat crow RAJ). Like Randy Wolf, whose kERA is really high right now, but whom he might be able to get with the Brewers picking up most of the tab. Like some of the players on the Blue Jays. Like Paul Maholm, currently out of favor, but who is still a relatively inexpensive option.<query> who is haren raj</query> If we can’t get Haren, given that we already have Halladay and a resurgent Hamels, we actually don’t need a front-liner. And I especially dislike giving up Happ for Oswalt right now (selling low on the ROY runner-up; Happ for Haren is fine). The ideal candidate is the 2007 Kyle Lohse. Yes I am old. I remember the Phils good old days and their bad old days. Course, the good old days I'm thinking of were in 2009.

Anyone know enough to give some kind of comparison to a deal for the Phillies? by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 2:50 PM EDT reply actions Turner is roughly Cosart, give or take a bit of name recognition. Oliver’s an interesting case in that he’s a lefty with really good raw stuff, but it’s never fully translated into results. Could be a top-end starter if he puts it all together, or could wind up hyst a reliever, but has upside significantly higher than any of the MLB-ready arms the Phillies could provide (Happ, Worley, etc.).<query> who is andrew oliver</query> Oswalt's 2012 option would be worth $16 million. over 1 year ago WholeCamels 38 comments 0 recs | Tweet Email Print More from The Good Phight Roy Oswalt is still a free agent, may sign somewhere mid-season, owns a bulldozer.

Not necessarily the case if he the Phillies wanted to trade for him. Looking forward to the Kevin Kolb era. 5-8-10...the day the Purdue Boilermakers basketball team won the 2011 NCAA Championship!! by EREX21 on Jul 24, 2010 10:21 AM EDT reply actions Haren, Haren, Haren, Haren, Haren Oswalt… why? He’s more expensive, has a shorter contract, isn’t quite as good… and it’s not like the D’backs asking price looks like all that much at this point.<query> how old is haren oswalt</query> I was dumbfounded this morning when I sawwhat the Yankees had put on the table for Haren — the fact that a club would even seriously offer something like that just confirms my suspicion that Haren is very seriously underrated as a commodity. Ruben: do it. Don’t let the Arizona front office peeps off the phone until you find out what they want you to deal Werth for, add Happ to the package plus any incidental pieces necessary, and get it done. If you’re really entertaining the idea of dealing for Oswalt, then this should be an absolute no-brainer. Seriously, if I see Haren move somewhere else for a package anything remotely like the one above, while you putz around figuring out if you can trade our top prospects for Roy Oswalt, I’m going to skip the bar exam, drive down to CBP, and commit some serious assault and battery on your ass.<query> who is roy oswalt traded for</query> by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 11:48 AM EDT reply actions I’m guessing Haren would require, at the very least, Happ, some good prospects in return for Werth (which really is the main unknown), and maybe even one of our Single A star prospects. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 11:51 AM EDT up reply actions and that would be just fine http://www.thegoodphight.com by WholeCamels on Jul 24, 2010 11:58 AM EDT up reply actions But the problem there is who knows what we’re getting for Werth? Will it be enough to make that? And of course, how will Ruben manage to overpay? by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 12:22 PM EDT up reply actions What we can get for Werth is an open question, but I’m optimistic on that front.<query> what kind of prospects does haren need</query> First off, with DeJesus now out for the year (not to mention Hart jamming his thumb last night, though he’s not expected to miss much time), you’d have to think that the demand for Werth would be fairly substantial. Secondly, I mean… justlook at that offer the Yankees made. I don’t even really need to know who the other two prospects are (it wouldn’t be Montero or Sanchez)… the fact that the D’backs have any interest in Ivan Nova and Zach MacAllister as their “young pitching” return just shows that they’re completely missing the boat here. Between Werth, Happ, one of Colvin/Cosart, and a few smaller pieces (think Mathieson, Worley, etc.) there’s definitely enough to get this done. And to answer your below question, I don’t think that’s a crazy amount at all.<query> who is werth</query> by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 12:28 PM EDT up reply actions haven’t the phils been fleeced by the yanks in recent trades? At least the abreu/lidle one. by Bilzo on Jul 24, 2010 12:58 PM EDT up reply actions Better not be Happ+Colvin/Cosart, thank you. That’s a bit too much to swallow, even though 3 1/2 years of Haren would be amazing. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 2:45 PM EDT up reply actions To each his own, but in my mind, Happ + Werth + Colvin/Cosart is a bargain for a top 15 pitcher in baseball on a relatively team-friendly deal. by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 3:09 PM EDT up reply actions A bargain? I guess you really value Cosart or Colvin less than I do, and probably Happ somewhat as well.<query> who is happ and cosart</query>"

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority. Further proposals include transformation to a Social Enterprise. These proposals provide the opportunity for future community health services to be provided through Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) ensuring better partnership working with different organisations developing healthcare services together. All Primary Care Trusts including NHS Northamptonshire will complete the transformation by April 2011.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results. Not all hospitals are able to provide this level of care or see enough patients, so it's worth travelling further to a hospital that can. It has not yet been decided where in the East Midlands these Specialist Centres will be. Each hospital has been asked if they are able to offer a specialist 24/7 service and we are talking to patients and health professionals before we make any decisions. As part of the commitment to seeking public opinion we're inviting the public to a NHS East Midlands-led workshop, where we will give an overview of the current system and outline our initial thoughts on what a new system would look like. The workshop will give you the opportunity to raise any questions and give us your feedback on the plans.<query> where is a specialist centre in nhs</query> The workshop will take place on Friday 27 November at Wellingborough Museum commencing at 10am with refreshments.

Cars traveling on Interstate highways can expect to be stopped, with traffic backed up for miles, while Homeland Security and the federalized state or local police conduct searches. I witnessed one such warrantless search on Easter Sunday. The south bound lanes of I-185 heading into Columbus, Georgia, were at a standstill while black SUV and police car lights flashed. US citizens were treated by “security” forces that they finance as if they were “terrorists” or “domestic extremists,” another undefined class of Americans devoid of constitutional protections. These events are Kafkaesque in themselves, but they are ever more so when one considers that these extraordinary violations of the US Constitution fail to be overturned in the Supreme Court. Apparently, American citizens lack standing to defend their civil liberties.<query> why are citizens treated as terrorists</query> Yet, ObamaCare is before the US Supreme Court. The conservative majority might now utilize the “judicial activism” for which conservatives have criticized liberals. Hypocrisy should no longer surprise us. However, the fight over ObamaCare is not worth five cents. It is extraordinary that “liberals,” “progressives,” “Democrats,” whatever they are, are defending a “health program” that uses public monies to pay private insurance companies and that raises the cost of health care. Americans have been brainwashed that “a single-payer system is unaffordable” because it is “socialized medicine.” Despite this propaganda, accepted by many Americans, European countries manage to afford single-payer systems. Health care is not a stress, a trauma, an unaffordable expense for European populations. Among the Western Civilized Nations, only the richest, the US, has no universal health care.<query> why is single payer health care unaffordable</query> The American health care system is the most expensive of all on earth. The reason for the extraordinary expense is the multiple of entities that must make profits. The private doctors must make profits. The private testing centers must make profits. The private specialists who receive the referrals from general practitioners must make profits. The private hospitals must make profits. The private insurance companies must make profits. The profits are a huge cost of health care. On top of these profits come the costs of preventing and combatting fraud. Because private insurance companies resist paying and Medicare pays a small fraction of the medical charges, private health care providers charge as much as they possibly can, knowing that the payments will be cut to the bone. But a billing mistake of even $300 can bankrupt a health care provider from legal expenses defending him/her self from fraud accusations.<query> why is the american health care system the most expensive</query> The beauty of a single-payer system is that it takes the profits out of the system. No one has to make profits. Wall Street cannot threaten insurance companies and private health care companies with being taken over because their profits are too low. No health-provider in a single-payer system has to worry about being displaced in a takeover organized by Wall Street because the profits are too low. Because a single-payer system eliminates the profits that drive up the costs, Wall Street, Insurance companies, and “free market economists” hate a “socialized” medical care system. They prefer a socialized “private” health care system in which public monies flow into private insurance companies. To make the costs as high as possible, conservatives and the private insurance companies devised ObamaCare. The bill was written by conservative think tanks and the private insurance companies.<query> why is single payer health care a good idea</query> What the “socialistic” ObamaCare bill does is to take income taxes paid by citizens and use the taxes to subsidize the private medical premiums charges by private health care providers in order to provide “private” health care to US citizens who cannot afford it. The extremely high costs of ObamaCare is not “socialistic medicine.” ObamaCare is high-cost privatized medicine that guarantees billions of dollars in profits to private insurance companies. It remains to be seen whether such a ridiculous health care scheme, nowhere extant on earth except in Romney’s Massachusetts, will provide health care or just private profits. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Paul Craig Roberts [<query> what is the socialistic obamacare bill</query> paulcraigroberts@yahoo.com ] was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during President Reagan’s first term.

The elite wants to oppress and exploit the rest of us. In a material sense, they are our enemy. They are working to establish aOne World Company, aka a totalitarian New World Order.

So yeah, Google is my primary research tool. It's also my mother's. Collectively, our dependence on Google is not a problem because it allegedly weakens our faculties. It's a problem because Google bakes biases into its algorithms. And we fail to recognize that fact. Most of the time, we can't even discern what they are. Most of the recent changes in Google's search algorithms make Google much better for shopping and much worse for learning. That could make us collectively dumber, but not individually. That's why we need a fresh approach to how we manage our information ecosystem. The same service cannot serve wisdom and wealth equally well. I'm sorry. What was the question?<query> why is google a problem</query> I got distracted by YouTube for a moment... Q: At a digital scholarship conference last fall, I watched Daniel M. Russell, a senior research scientist at Google in charge of “user happiness,” give an academic audience a demonstration of what treasures lie in the depths of Google’s trove — a facsimile of Stravinsky’s score from “Sacre du Printemps,” a 3-D model of the Notre Dame Cathedral, unemployment data for Santa Clara County over the last 20 years — before lamenting that most students have no idea how to find them. The implication was that Google has created this rich, open vault that students love to use but which colleges are failing to teach them to use effectively. To what extent can better training and education realistically solve this problem? A: Well, I am not sure training is the gap here.<query> who is daniel russell</query> Google keeps rolling out cool features and services faster than we can fold them into our habits and curricula. A couple of weeks ago Google unveiled a really cool high-definition tool to explore major art works in museums. Every day I plan to use it to show my daughter some of her favorite works. But every evening I forget to do that because I just can't get out of the tangle of links connecting YouTube videos. Google has not figured out how to connect with the right faculty in the right numbers for many of its services. But it's not really Google's fault. Perhaps each university should assign a librarian to be the Chief Google Officer so she or he could hip faculty to the newest, coolest things. Q: Lest our readers assume that your book is a frothing, techno-phobic screed penned by a dyed-in-the-tweed academic who lives to prove that any large, profitable company is necessarily sinister and exploitative, I should mention that you actually have some quite nice things to say about Google in these pages.<query> why is google not hiring a librarian</query> What is the greatest contribution Google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life? A: Google made the Web usable. Before this clean and useful search tool, using the Web well meant starting at a trusted point and following trusted links. That's why it is called a ""web."" With decent search one can just drop down into a new part of the Web, skipping over the useless and icky parts. Google actually cleaned up the Web — or at least our experience of it. Not long ago simple searches for double entendres like ""facial"" would yield anything but links to the cosmetic spa treatment. Google's biases — what it calls standards — effectively hide the most troublesome links deep in the search results. You can find the yucky stuff by searching for exactly what you might want.<query> what is the greatest contribution google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life?</query> But you are unlikely to stumble upon bad stuff accidentally. This is a great service, but one with real costs at the margins. Beyond that, Google Docs is a major service to higher education. It's the easiest and most dependable way to allow multiple authors and editors to work on a document together. It lacks the useless gizmos that infect Microsoft Office. I use the Google Docs presentation software to run slides for class because it's simple, dependable, and can host embedded YouTube videos. Did I mention that I spend too much time on YouTube? That said, I believe it's incumbent on universities to ensure maximum user confidentiality and data security for any Google product. I don't believe universities have been strong or effective negotiators for their students' and faculties' interests when it comes to using Google services.<query> why use google docs</query> There should be a collective set of best practices for when universities deploy third-party services that collect user data. Q: Your book culminates with a proposal for an alternative to Google’s “hyper-commercialized, data-mined, advertising-directed” model — working title: the Human Knowledge Project. Contrary to Google, this project would set the agenda for the creation of a information system that is public, comprehensive, civic-minded, and strong enough to outlast its colorful, colossal counterpart. How plausible is it that a confederation of relatively cash-poor and fractious public institutions might actually shoulder the resolve and unity of vision to field a more stable alternative to Google? Does any part of you fear that what “the Googlization of everything” has taken from humanity, humanity lacks the will to reclaim?<query> what is the human knowledge project</query> A: The Human Knowledge Project would be a 50-year public, global plan to design, legislate for, enable, and fund a global digital library service to deliver the best information to the most people. It's as feasible as it is desirable. In other words, if we don't do it it's because we don't really want it. States are only as cash-poor as they choose to be. States are only as incompetent as they are designed to be. The fractured nature of public discourse could be the source of strength for such a project as long as we all agree on the terms of debate and the over-arching goal: that no child growing up in Sweden should have better access to better information than a child growing up in Rwanda would have. If we don't agree to that, then we should not pursue the Human Knowledge Project.<query> why is the human knowledge project not feasible</query> If we do agree, then let's start a political campaign for it. Let's figure out the steps we need to take. Let's change the laws we need to change. Let's raise the money we need to raise. The goal would not be to oust or push Google. The goal would be to build what we want and need without resorting to cheap, short-term fixes. If anyone should ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible,"" it should be the world itself.

Later, Page and Brin would rely on university largesse in the early days of the Google Book Search project, when major research libraries allowed the company to scan huge portions of their collections for free. In return, Google has given higher education Google Scholar, which provides a popular bridge to otherwise obscure academic research; Google Apps for Education, which enables universities to use the company’s e-mail and communications tools, and its huge server capacity, for free; and, of course, Google Book Search — which, despite its discomfiting monopoly, gives scholars a more comprehensive body of digitized literature than has ever existed.<query> who is google founder</query> “Google,” Vaidhyanathan observes, “is an example of a stunningly successful firm behaving as much like a university as it can afford to.” But as is often the case with cousins, the genetic differences between higher education and Google are more striking than their similarities. Beneath the interdependence and shared hereditary traits, tensions creep. And like an awkward Thanksgiving dinner, Vaidhyanathan’s new book,The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry) (University of California Press), provokes these tensions to the surface. The Virginia professor, who is not afraid to confess his affection for the ease and usefulness of Google, nevertheless distrusts the company’s basic motivations as it vies for our intellectual inheritance. “Google has fostered a more seamless, democratized, global, cosmopolitan information ecosystem,” he writes. “Yet it has simultaneously contributed to the steady commercialization of higher education and the erosion of standards of information quality.” Google does not reward our impulse to know, Vaidhyanathan argues; it exploits it by making it appear as though knowing is easy.<query> who is google professor</query> “The ways that Google structures, judges, and delivers knowledge to us exacerbate our worst tendencies to jump to erroneous conclusions and act on them in ways that cause harm,” the professor writes. Meanwhile the company keeps collecting, on behalf of its advertisers, the wealth of personal information that we feed it in exchange for this flattery, then pats its own back all the way to the bank. Vaidhyanathan’s point is not that Google has scammed us. He attributes the ascension of Google to a “public failure” — negligence by public stewards to preempt the privatization of knowledge and learning in the switch from analog to digital. In other words, we should have seen this coming. Did Google’s academic bloodlines lull higher education into passively supporting Page and Brin as they quietly absconded with the family jewels? Perhaps, but Vaidhyanathan is less concerned with how we got here than where we are and where we’re going.<query> who is google</query> Accordingly, he proposes a sprawling effort by libraries and like-minded institutions that would essentially give Googlers a public option. “The future of knowledge — and thus the future of the species — depends on our getting this right,” he writes. Inside Higher Ed caught up with Vaidhyanathan, whose Wikipedia page credits him with coining the term “Critical Information Studies,” though it does not cite its source. Q: You admit early on that your book has an “overtly political” agenda: greater government regulation of Google. When a company exerts such control over public goods — like, say, a digital archive of 130 million books comprising the entire living history of human thought — oversight by public authorities becomes necessary, you argue. One might counter that public institutions are potentially just as compromising.<query> who coined the term critical information studies?</query> To the extent that regulation would transfer power over the basic infrastructure of knowledge and learning from Google to the government, might we simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization? A: While I argue that we should consider — not fear — the prospect of regulating Google, I stop short of prescribing much in the way of specific regulation. My goal is to convince readers that Google is already highly regulated, so it's dumb to say that Google should remain unregulated. More importantly, I want to raise the prospect of whether Google and the Internet in general are properly regulated. That, to me, is the grown-up way to approach the question. Right now Google is haphazardly and clumsily regulated. Copyright stops Google and others from doing clever, useful things. Antitrust is too toothless to provide serious competition in online, search-based advertisements.<query> why is google unregulated</query> Most important from the perspective of the values important to a democratic republic, Google's search standards are opaque and potentially corrupt. That's whythe European Union is examining them. I don't believe Google's search results are corrupted. I do believe they very well could be in the near future. And there is no guarantee that the next company that governs search would be named Google. As to the direct questions about whether the transfer of authority from firm to state would ""simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization,"" I say exactly! Politicization means that citizens battle over competing visions of the good. That's what we are supposed to do in a democratic republic. Fundamentally, we must recognize that some things are too important to be entrusted to unaccountable private actors. There may be hazards.<query> why is google search corrupt</query> But they are our hazards. Q: As you write, it is not just our institutions that are being “Googlized”; so are our minds and habits. Some surveys have suggested that nearly half of college students use Google as their primary research tool. “Googlized” students have poor memories and inflated expectations about how much effort it takes to dig up definitive answers. A Greek chorus of tsk-ing academics has all but declared this a preamble to the Twitter-apocalypse. Are they right? A: I don't subscribe to the ""Google is making us dumber"" position. I think Google is allowing us to be differently smart. I also refuse to bracket off my students as some exotic tribe that behaves and reacts differently than I do or my mother does. We are all in this crazy environment together.<query> why is google making us dumber</query>"

Exciting stuff, huh? Background I’ve been a Mac user for a little over four years now. In fact, the journey has been more-or-less chronicled here on my blogsince acquiring a MacBook Pro in 2007. I still have the same machine, and it is still in great condition, although I’ve been through several batteries.<query> what is the lost outpost</query> I suspect that Lion and the Air make a great match. → 1 Comment Posted in blog Tagged Apple, desktop, interaction, iOS, iTunes, Mac, Mac App Store, Mac OS X Lion, macbook, macosx, Magic Trackpad, Operating system, review, software, thoughts A 3GS hit-and-run Posted on June 23, 2009 | 11 Comments I hadn’t intended to spend any time at all talking specifically about the iPhone 3GS here on the blog, but followinga comment by Per[1] I thought I’d jot down a few notes. Firstly, given my previous comments about O2 and the upgrade issue… I should explain why I bothered. I got the 3.0 upgrade on the 3G when it came out last Wednesday, and liked what I found, particularly the option to install more than the 2.0 OS limit of 144 / 9 pages of apps.<query> what operating system does the iphone 3gs use</query> It’s now effectively unlimited, since even if you don’t have space on a home screen, you can search for the app using Spotlight. That’s nice. However, I was already hitting my space limit on the 16Gb 3G, so room to breathe was going to be handy. I also liked the improved navigation and possibility to getthe TomTom kit in the future, and once I’d tried the camera in-store, I thought that was going to be a big deal as well (more on that, below). There was a small amount of peer pressure too, given ourconversation on last week’s Dogear Nation. In the end I opted to get a PAYG phone, swap in my contract SIM, and sell the old handset toMazuma. If I’d waited to upgrade and then wanted the same handset I now have, I’d've ended up on another 18 (or 24) month contract with the same upgrade trap in June, and probably on a higher tariff to subsidise the cost of a new handset.<query> what is the space limit for tomtom</query> This way my existing contract will run out in due course, I stay on the same tariff, and the handset doesn’t cost much more than it would have done come “upgrade” time in 3-6 months. So what’s good? It’s very clearly nippier. Every operation is obviously faster and cleaner. I’m liking the camera and video recording (zoom would be nice, but variable focus and auto-adjusting exposure/white balance work for me). It was a great move to retain the 3G body and form factor – myClarifi case still fits perfectly, and the macro lens seems to let me focus marginally closer still than the 3GS can manage on its own (it does a good job by itself, though). Amongst the sprinkling of other functions I like, not specific to the new model, are the landscape keyboard and the improved podcast playback features – did you know you can slide horizontally to scrub through a track, and slide down to scrub more finely?<query> what is the new myclarifi 3gs</query> Neat. The real revelation so far though, has been the screen. The new smudge / grease-resistant coating is a marvel. So far I’ve not fitted a screen protector, and although I’m loath to allow it to become physically scratched, the new screen feels and looks so much better and remains much, much cleaner. It’s just… almost magic. In the “miss” column we have the voice control feature, which I’m not sure I’ll be using much; and shake-to-shuffle (is this actually supposed to work if the display is locked, by the way? seems not to do so for me, which makes it even more pointless). Oh, and battery life seems worse, but I suspect the compass and the notifications feature are contributing to that, as are the wider range of ways I’m actually using it.<query> does shake to shuffle work on a pc</query> May have to think about aMophie Juice Pack Air. I used the video function in anger for the first time today, uploading one clip from the Hursley Tri-Department sports tournamentdirectly to YouTube, and later grabbed a set of clips from the phone via iPhoto (yes, iPhoto manages video from the iPhone, go figure) and edited them together in iMovie. It’s not the best quality but probably still as good as my cheap USB camcorder – plus the screen and on-device editing features are nice additions. Rumours arethat the chipset is capable of 720p video, but I doubt we’ll get to see that in the current generation of device. I’ve posteda bunch of sample photos to Flickr as well, if you are interested – theBlue Eyeball shot was taken at close quarters with the Clarifi. Really nothing more to say here.<query> what is the best iphone camera for video</query> There are more than enough people getting excited about the device and as I said, I hadn’t planned to write up any thoughts – blamethat Danish guy [1] just because I responded to audience pressure this time, don’t expect me to do it every time, m’kay? → 11 Comments Posted in 24924 Tagged Apple, gadget, iphone, iphone 3gs, O2, Photography, review, video The Great Address Book Cleanup Posted on May 20, 2009 | 6 Comments This was fairly tedious, so I thought I’d share it with you, my loyal blog readers Over time, my address book has become unmanageable. Until today, what I had managed to achieve was a curious fusion of useful family postal address data, mostly from the pre-social network, pre-email, pre-mobile days of 10-15 years ago when I had loaded it all into Evolution on Linux; several personal and work mobile phone SIMs worth of numbers in various formats, covering probably a 10 year period judging from the names and numbers in there; and lots and lots of email addresses, covering a similar period, but recently bloated by the habits of Gmail and Apple Mail of storing some data automagically.<query> what is the address book on an iphone</query> In short: a total mess. I had multiple entries for several of my close friends and family; original home addresses of university friends I have not been in contact with for 12 years (!); and outdated information for many other folks. The iPhone was really the final catalyst for sorting all of this out. More than once recently, I’ve tried to find a number for a friend, and had several entries for that person, several of which were out of date. I’ve called a good friend’s brother on a phone he gave him more than seven years ago, twice in the past 6 months. That’s how useless I’ve become at managing this stuff. Since the iPhone was core to the issue, and since it syncs with the Address Book, I decided to use that as my core tool for fixing the problem.<query> why is my address book out of date</query> Here’s more-or-less what I ended up doing: Cleaned up multiple entries in Address Book, merging into a single entry for any one contact, including work and personal data, and adding company names where possible. Deleted redundant entries such as the university addresses which I knew were going to be wrong. Read through the various hints on this page for information on how I could get contact data from LinkedIn and Facebook and elsewhere… Exported my LinkedIn Contacts as a .vcf file for import into Address Book… imported and checked the merge information. Grabbed my Facebook Contacts phone details using a Greasemonkey script and a tool called AddressBooker (see the above linked hints page for details). At this point I had an issue. Downloading from AddressBooker as .vcf caused all the names to be exported as just FirstName fields, so when I tried to merge into Address Book everyone came up as a “new” contact.<query> can you import linkedin contacts into address book</query> A better solution turned out to be to import directly from AddressBooker into Google Mail Contacts first; do any data merging and cleanup there (GMail Contacts has a nice “merge contacts” capability if you have multiple entries for one person); and then export as .vcf, and import into Address Book, checking the merge information as before with LinkedIn. Sounds long-winded, but it would have taken longer to manage manually in Address Book. At this point, Apple Address Book contained my “authoritative” contact list. To get it back into GMail, I scrubbed my whole GMail contacts list (slightly scary, but necessary), and then played around withthe Automator action described in the Maciverse tips page, trying to use Numbers instead of Excel. Ultimately that was a disaster as it just couldn’t encode the tab-separated to CSV files correctly.<query> can you merge contacts from address book into gmail</query> The final answer turned out to be a brilliant little (free / donationware) utility calledA to G. Get it. Use it. Donate. Result! And next time, I’ll try not to let this get so out of hand… I see another wrinkle in this whole space. Although tools like Google Voice tend towards centralising all your contact details behind a single number you control (great idea – dear Google, when can we get it in Europe? hint hint!), the proliferation of social networks means that we all have multiple profiles and IDs. In particular, I find Skype and Twitter addresses hugely useful. Apple’s Address Book, of course, doesn’t provide “official” spots for those… there’s no entry for Skype in the IM drop-down list, and no space for arbitrary URLs, you have to edit and maintain a list of them.<query> what is skype and twitter</query> It has never seen a fresh install of the OS since it shipped (with OS X Tiger 10.4) – instead, it has been upgraded through Leopard andSnow Leopard (which I really liked on its debut). Over time though, it has become less central to my computing experience. I moved from Windows to Ubuntu on my day-to-day work machine, and my computing life fragmented to include a netbook, smartphones, and most recently a tablet (which is yet another of those things I keep meaning to write about!). Main use cases for the Mac continue to be Keynote – by far the best presentation software available on any platform, in my opinion; Lightroom and iMovie; and iTunes, which is firmly embedded in my life as a sync source for my iPhone and for organising my music library.<query> what is the mac used for</query> Something more extensible and easy to keep in sync would be very useful. Update: the broken part Google Talk appears now to have completely lost my contact list. Gah. So if you were connected to me on Gtalk then you may need to reconnect, or you may get a new connection request from me.

For those not obsessed with Twitter or their follower numbers, there’s an application you probably haven’t heard of called TwitterCounter.<query> what is twitter counter</query> The site provides tools, graphs and APIs for charting the growth of a user’s Twitter followers. It’s interesting, and if you’re slightly obsessive about figures and have a belief that such things “matter”, then you might already spend time checking it and looking at the pretty graphs. It also provides an element of “prediction” based on historical growth trends, and does cool things like allowing users to compare themselves to others and watch the graphs intersect or overlap. There’s just one issue – although it looks great on the desktop, the site isn’t laid out very well for mobile browsers like Mobile Safari on the iPhone. It also uses a Flash component to display the graph, and since there’s currently no Flash on the iPhone, you get a big blank box in the middle of the screen. The nice part is that TwitterCounter has a simple REST API which enables a developer to get the raw data about a user’s follower numbers.<query> what is twitter counter</query> If you use Twitter clients likeTweetdeck, then you’ll see this in action. Based on my previous experience of using the iWebkit framework to build an iPhone-optimised web wrapper for the data from my Current Cost meter, I thought it might be interesting to play around with using iWebkit to display the TwitterCounter stats. iWebkit is a simple HTML framework which provides a set of CSS classes to make your web pages look like native iPhone apps. There are other frameworks out there like iUI and webapp.net, but they depend a lot more on knowledge of AJAX and some more advanced / dynamic coding, whereas iWebkit is all about simplicity – if you know your HTML basics, it is pretty straightforward. As it happens, you can extend it very easily as well – in my case, I combined it with some PHP functions which call out to TwitterCounter and echo the numbers into a table on a web page.<query> what is iwebkit</query> Although I worked with PHP a lot a few years ago, I hadn’t really done much with the language recently. The first thing I did was to create a simple piece of code to call the TwitterCounter API and get back the data for a specific user; and then I displayed it in a web page. Once I’d done that, it was pretty easy to get the whole thing wrapped into two pages of iWebkit template code, and style it all appropriately. Revision one of the interface and app ran off my home server, and didn’t look fantastic. My initial thought for a name was “TwitterCounter nano”, but I changed it after realising that it didn’t fit so well as a name on the iPhone home screen In the screenshot on the left, you’ll also see that the first form I came up with was far from “iPhone native-looking”… the current version of iWebkit didn’t have form CSS classes, so I had to tweak things a little.<query> what is twittercounter nano</query> I also found it was worth digging into theApple Web Development Guidelines for the iPhone, which gave some hints about how to make some iPhone-specific tweaks like turning off auto-capitalisation for the text entry box (since most usernames are all in lowercase), and how to add a text hint, for example. So, the second iteration of the UI looks a lot nicer. It’s also possible to hit the bookmark button in Safari and add the app as a shortcut on the iPhone home screen… (see the icon at the top of the post)… if you do that, and launch TwtrCtr from there, it will act as a full-screen iPhone app with no Safari controls, giving a much more native experience. The user can then navigate by using the controls in the header bar rather than the forward and back buttons provided by the browser.<query> can you add a bookmark to safari</query> I added an FAQ page, too, so if you want to know more about the app you can check that out directly on the site. In these days of heightened concern about Twitter security I also thought it would be a good idea to add a note on the front screen to point out that it doesn’t ask for anything more than a username, and it doesn’t log that anywhere, it just passes it on to the TwitterCounter API. OK, that was a rather long explanation of the evolution of the first page! The important part is actually how the data is displayed. Once you’ve entered a valid Twitter username and hit “Get User Stats”, you get a single-page representation of the TwitterCounter data for the given user. The top 2 or three rows are links which will open the user’s profile page, homepage/URL (if one is set… otherwise that row doesn’t display), or display a simple graph / chart which is generated by theGoogle Chart API.<query> how to get twitter stats</query> The latter is something high on my list of enhancements, because it looks a little dull at the moment; also, I’m generating the Google Charts URL myself rather than using one of the PHP wrappers to the API, which would probably be a lot simpler. Don’t look too closely for the rough edges… right now, it doesn’t actually make any effort deal with cases where a user doesn’t exist, or TwitterCounter or Twitter is down…. I know about those small issues In a nutshell, then – that’s all it is. A mashup which allowed me to explore a bit more iPhone-specific web development, some PHP / REST / XML coding, and a bit of Google Charts stuff as well. I have to say that the TwitterCounter folks (Boris and Arjen in particular) have been brilliant and very helpful and supportive, despite their app having an issue with the Twitter API while I was in the middle of developing this mashup on top of their API!<query> what is twittercounter</query> iWebkit is a lot of fun to play with, and very simple as well – I know the developers are working hard to add new features into that framework whilst keeping it simple and aiming it at “non-techies”. Oh, and incidentally, although the stylesheets make it look like an iPhone app, it should work perfectly well in any desktop or mobile browser – it’s plain old HTML. I’m not making any claims about how this might develop in the future, but I’ve got a couple of ideas for tweaks that I might make. In the meantime, if you’re an iPhone (or other mobile device) Twitter user, do take a look athttp://andypiper.tv/twtrctr and see how it works for you.

I previously owned a 2nd generation nano, and loved it. Light, easy to use… OK the screen was tiny and the capacity was limited, but it did the job. The iPhone has that nice big screen with video playback going for it, and now it also has the new (and very, very cool) Genius playlist feature.<query> what is the best iphone ever made</query> Just a small number of issues, then… No search? the 2G nano had search! Am I missing something? No ability to read the notes for podcasts. On the nano I could press the button to cycle through time / cover art / lyrics or info display, and on the iPhone I get lyrics or the “back” of the album cover. Nothing useful for podcasts. The time slider is way too difficult to control with a finger. On a longer podcast, say over an hour, skipping over a minute or two of the duration is almost impossible. The click wheel definitely wins there. Finally, and most annoyingly: no external skip / pause control. I have to take the phone out of my pocket, potentially unlock the screen, and then skip to the next track.<query> what is the nano</query> Even thoughthe iTunes data itself was migrated off the now-comparatively-weedy 120Gb internal drive a couple of years ago, I’ve continued to struggle for a comfortable amount of available disk space, but I still use the Mac for all of those things and I can’t really think of a viable alternative, despite the cloudification of many of the other services I use and their associated data. Pros and Cons When Lion was announced and the features previewed last year, I really struggled to see anything compelling in the release. It was clear that it was the iOSification of the desktop OS. The early views of Mission Control looked cluttered and bloated (combine Dashboard, Spaces, and Expose? surely a mess?). I wasn’t a fan of the idea of the Launchpad, I didn’t have a multitouch trackpad, I like to be able to switch and recompose app windows on a GUI and not run things full-screen.<query> what is the pros and cons of lion</query> Really not the best idea when travelling on the London Underground (“that’s right folks, I have a 3G iPhone, please mug me at the next station”). OK – time for a confession here. I never unpacked the iPhone headphones until last week. I didn’t realise that they have a mic on the wire with a click switch which gives the forward/back/pause control. Why? Because I’m so used to the poor audio quality of the Apple earbuds thatI switched to Shure ones several months ago and I’ve been using them since. So it seems to me that what is needed is some kind of cable which can fit in between third-party headphones and the iPhone’s headphone socket with an external switch on them. I think the iPhone is an awesome device, but for me, it just isn’t the best iPod I’ve ever had.<query> do iphone headphones have mic</query> Technorati Tags: iPhone, iPod, Apple, nano, touch, headphones, audio → 11 Comments Posted in 24924 Tagged Apple, audio, headphones, iphone, iPod, nano, touch ← Older posts Contact the author Andy Piper social bridgebuilder |photographer | techie | speaker | podcaster | community lead voice: +44 20 3287 1302 email: compose Follow @andypiper Google Profile More about Andy...

Join 4,226 other followers Powered by WordPress.com<query> what is coraline theme</query> My early experience of the Mac App Store wasn’t positive either, with many apps I’d previously purchased having to potentially be repurchased to get the benefits of autoupdate that the App Store could bring. My early 2007 MacBook was just on the cusp of supported hardware for Lion (it scraped in by virtue of the Core 2 Duo processor; I bought a Magic Trackpad a little while ago to take advantage of gestures, although since it’s separate I still haven’t used it a great deal). I already mentioned my continual struggle for space on the hard drive, but knowing that Apple had actually managed to make the OS smaller in previous releases by getting rid of legacy cruft, it seemed like Lion might be worth a shot. I spent the week before the release cleaning things up – removing any remaining Classic apps or PPC apps that relied on the now-defunct Rosetta (very few, mostly old camera drivers which were only included in their respective packages to support older machines at the time they shipped); running OnyX to clean out caches and logs; uninstalling anything I’d not used for a long time; cleaning down Library and Application Support folders associated with software I no longer use.<query> what is the app store for macbook pro</query> Yes, a clean install would have got around this, but on the flipside I would have spent a lot of time putting things back the way they were and reinstalling software. Once I’d done the upgrade I was miffed to discover that the installation package had vanished, but I’m glad thatthe brilliant Don McAllister has found a way to recover it from the Mac App Store for future use! So what do I think? Well, the scrolling thing is interesting. I get the reason that so-called “natural” scrolling has been introduced to unify the touch interfaces across OS X and iOS, and I also realise that while I could switch it off, it’s not going to go away so I may as well get comfortable with the idea. It’s one of those brain-rewiring exercises, similar to the one I’ve been going through learning Unity on Ubuntu, and for the same reason – there’s little point in fighting the future once the decisions are made.<query> why is scrolling on mac</query> Now for two things I didn’t expect to like: Mission Control and full-screen apps. I really, really like them… I’vealways used a large number of Spaces to organise my workspace and I’m finding that Mission Control makes this even more intuitive. I can still quickly zoom out to have an overview and move things around, and if I’m using the Magic Trackpad the swiping to switch apps and spaces is nice too. There are a few apps that need work on their full-screen modes, notably Chrome, but that will come in time. I’m not bothered by iCal or Address Book having strange faux-”natural” new looks, since I’ve migrated almost all of my use of those apps to Google anyway, for maximum interoperability across devices and platforms. On the rest of the visual aspects, I’m not sure I like the “zoom/pop” dialog boxes yet.<query> what apps need to be on full screen</query> The more rectangular buttons do seem more serious and polished than the older Aqua lozenge style, but it’s a shame to see a much more grey overall feeling across the UI. Java is gone, as Apple said it would be, but the procedure to get it back was very smooth and simple, typing “java” in a command window started an Apple Update installation, with within a few moments it was all done. A couple of little niggles with some other apps. I also found myself resetting my Dock (which I’d been running in 2D with various folders docked as Stacks) to its default state by clearing down the associated .plist files and restarting it, to get it back to the way Lion comes out of the box / download. The future I mentioned a tablet and a variety of other lightweight devices, but I can’t see myself abandoning the PC device (in this case a laptop of some kind) just yet.<query> what is the default dock in lion</query> As I mentioned in the discussion of scrolling, I’m firmly of the opinion that we need to adapt to new ways of interacting with technology, and I’ve got a range of devices to play with right now. However, I haven’t yet found a replacement for the keyboard / graphical desktop / pointing device combination that is as effective forcreating content as a PC (be that Mac, Windows or Linux, with keyboard and mouse/trackpad/pointer). I can type quickly on a touchscreen smartphone or tablet now, but it’s still not as comfortable for creating text and laying out images as a graphical computer desktop of some kind. I can perform simple and basic image or video edits on a mobile device, but again for anything more extensive I find myself wanting to see more and have finer control than I get with a fat fingertip on a small touchscreen.<query> what is the difference between a keyboard and a pc</query> So all of that leads me to think ahead to a next device… not that I must have one at the moment, but still. I’ve increasingly fallen out of love with Apple over the past year or two as they have behaved in an increasingly anti-competitive manner over Android, the App Store, madesilly restrictions locking out hardware replacement in new iMacs, etc. – but I can’t see myself escaping the ecosystem completely due to the quality of the software I’ve already mentioned, even though I’m not locking myself in to the entire Apple life end-to-end. The new generation of MacBook Airs hit on Wednesday alongside Lion, and I’m reconsidering whether or not that would make an acceptable replacement for an older 15″ MBP. On paper, at the expense of a diagonal 2″ of screen real-estate, I would still get +1Gb RAM, potentially more storage (256Mb flash storage over 120Gb HDD), a CPU that’s clocked slower (1.7GHz vs 2.33GHz) but probably runs faster due to architectural improvements… it’s tempting… if I could be convinced that I’d get the performance I’d like in iMovie and Lightroom, and if I had the cash, then I might make that jump.<query> what is the new generation of macbook airs</query>"

A microphone icon appears at the right end of the iconic search box. If you have a microphone built-in or attached to your computer, clicking that icon creates a direct audio connection to Google's servers, which will convert your spoken words into text. It has been possible to speak Google search queries using a smart phone for almost three years; since last year, Android handsets have been able to take voice input in any situation where a keyboard would normally be used. ""That was transformational, because people stopped worrying about when they could and couldn't speak to the phone,"" says Vincent Vanhoucke , who leads the voice search engineering team at Google. Over the last 12 months, the number of spoken inputs, search or otherwise, via Android devices has climbed six times, and every day, tens of thousands of hours of audio speech are fed into Google's servers.<query> can you speak google search</query> ""On Android, a large fraction of the use is people dictating e-mail and SMS,"" says Vanhoucke. Vanhoucke's team now wants using voice on the Web to be as easy as it is on Android. ""It's a big bet,"" he says. "" Voice search for desktop is the flagship for this, [but] we want to take speech everywhere."" Voice recognition is more technically challenging on a desktop or laptop computer, says Vanhoucke, because it requires noise suppression algorithms that are not needed for mobile speech recognition. These algorithms filter out sounds such as those of a computer's fan or air conditioners. ""The quality of the audio is paramount for phone manufacturers, and you hold it close to your mouth,"" says Vanhoucke. ""On a PC, the microphone is an afterthought, and you are further away.<query> why is voice recognition difficult on a laptop</query> You don't get the best quality."" Google asked thousands of people to read phrases aloud to their computers to gather data on the conditions its speech recognition technology would have to handle. As people use the service for real, it is trained further, says Vanhoucke, which should increase its popularity. Data from users of mobile voice search shows that people are much more likely to use the feature again when it is accurate for them the first time. A bigger challenge to getting users to embrace voice recognition on the desktop could be the existing tools for entering information, says Keith Vertanen , a lecturer at Princeton University who researches voice-recognition technology. ""On the desktop, you're up against a very fast and efficient means of input in the keyboard,"" he says. ""On a phone, you don't have that available, and you are often in hands- or eyes-free situations where voice input really helps."" Vertanen says people are less tolerant of glitches when using speech recognition on a desktop computer because of the close proximity of a tried-and-true way of entering text.<query> why is voice recognition used on desktop</query> He says users might find voice recognition more compelling on on other Internet-connected devices in the home. ""Nonconventional devices like a DVR, television, or game console don't usually have good text input,"" he points out. Google TV devices can already take voice input spoken into a connected Android phone. Vanhoucke acknowledges that speech recognition fulfills a more immediate need on phones, but argues that users are ready for it on conventional computers, too. ""People will use it in ways that surprise us,"" he says. ""At this point, it's still an experiment."" Situations when people may have their hands full is one example, says Vanhoucke (although it should be noted that desktop voice search today still involves using the mouse to activate the feature). Google isn't performing this experiment alone. The company is pushing the Web standards body W3C to introduce a standard set of HTML markup that allows any website or app to call on voice recognition via the Web browser, and has already enabled a version of this markup in the Chrome browser.<query> what devices can voice recognition work on</query> For now, Google is the only major company with a browser able to use the prototype feature, but Mozilla, Microsoft, and AT&T are all working with the W3C effort. ""It's a collaborative effort that other browser makers are part of,"" says Vanhoucke. ""Any designer can add it to their Web page. It's something anyone can use."" Extensions for the Chrome browser that make use of voice input ( like this one ) have already appeared, and can be used to enter text on any website. However, those extensions reveal that although Google's desktop speech recognition is accurate for search queries, it's not much good for tasks like composing e-mail. Enabling the system to learn the personal quirks of each person's pronunciation, a feature already enabled on Android phones, could address that.<query> what browsers use voice input</query> Vertanen points out that the personalization learned through mobile search could easily be ported over to the desktop for people logged into their Google account. It could also make it possible for the technology to spring up elsewhere. ""The advantage of Google's networked approach is that a [speech] model in the cloud can adapt to your voice in all these different places and follow you around, whether that's in your living room or in your car."" A Browser that Speaks Your Language The latest version of Google's Chrome shows the potential of HTML5.

This is firsthand knowledge of, and practical experience with, the methods of psychological investigation and study. These methods include ways of behaving with the subjects being studied. Students are provided with whatever opportunities they need to reach those levels of competence representative of doctoral standing. Continuing research programs, sponsored by members of the faculty, offer direct opportunities for experience in fields represented by the faculty's many research interests. Each student achieves competence in unique ways and at different rates. Each student and adviser share in planning a program leading to the objectives discussed. The student is expected to spend half of his or her time on research and takes no more than 10 units of course work per quarter. For further information please contact the student services office and the department graduate guide.<query> what is the purpose of continuing research programs</query> TEACHING REQUIREMENT The department views experience in supervised teaching as an integral part of its graduate program. Regardless of the source of financial support, all students serve as teaching assistants for at least five Psychology courses during their graduate study. Of the courses, two must be PSYCH 1, Introduction to Psychology, or PSYCH 10, 252 or 253, Statistical Methods. Students are discouraged from participating in teaching during the first year of graduate study. Students typically progress from closely supervised teaching to more independent work. Some students may be invited to offer a supervised, but essentially independent, seminar during their final year of graduate study. PSYCHOLOGY COLLOQUIUM The Psychology Colloquium meets on most Wednesday afternoons at 3:45 p.m. Speakers from Stanford and other institutions present topics of current interest. Graduate students are expected to attend. Additional announcements may be found athttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/colloquium.<query> what is the stanford psychology teaching requirement</query> Copyright ©2011 Stanford University | Office of the University Registrar | Academic Year 2011-12 | Terms of Use | Copyright Complaints | Report a Problem with this site.<query> what year is stanford university</query> However, an applicant should have research experience as an undergraduate, as well as the equivalent of an undergraduate major in Psychology. The major focus of the doctoral program is on research training, and admission is highly selective. Applicants for admission must submit their scores on the general Graduate Record Examination as part of the application. GRE subject scores are recommended. General University requirements for the Ph.D. are described in the "" Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. In addition to fulfilling Stanford University requirements for the degree, the following departmental requirements are stipulated. First-Year Course Requirements—During the first year of graduate study, the student must take PSYCH 207, Proseminar for First-Year Ph.D. Graduate Students, at least one approved graduate statistics course, and at least two core courses from the following list: PSYCH 202.<query> what is the requirements for a phd degree</query> Neuroscience PSYCH 205. Foundations of Cognition PSYCH 211. Developmental Psychology PSYCH 212. Social Psychology or PSYCH 215. Mind, Culture, and Society PSYCH 213. Affective Science Students in each area may be required to take up to two additional non-core graduate courses in their area of specialization. The student is expected to spend at least half of the time in research from the beginning of the first year of graduate study to the completion of the Ph.D., taking no more than 10 units of course work each quarter. At the end of the first year of graduate study, the student must file with the department a written report of the first-year research activities. Second Year Course Requirements—By the end of the second year of graduate study, the student should complete the core courses listed above and take a second approved graduate course in statistics.<query> what courses are required for phd</query> Third-Year and Beyond—Students are expected to form a research committee, which must include the dissertation reading committee, before the initiation of the dissertation research. The research committee includes the dissertation adviser and consists of at least three faculty members, at least two of whom should have primary appointments in the Psychology department. For University guidelines for the composition of the dissertation reading committee, see the ""Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. The research committee should meet no later than the last day of classes of Spring Quarter of the third year, and determines the timeline for further development of the dissertation research project. Subsequent meetings are triggered by the completion of one of two documents: a dissertation proposal (DP) or a conceptual analysis of the dissertation area (CADA). The timing and sequencing of the DP and CADA are developed by the student in consultation with the committee.<query> what is the purpose of a research committee</query> As a general guide, one of the two preliminary elements (CADA or DP) should be completed by the end of the third Summer Quarter and the second should be completed by the end of the fourth Spring Quarter. Students are free to alter the membership of the committee at any time during the process, subject to consultation with the adviser. The DP should be a description of the proposed research. The CADA provides a framework for the research topic of the dissertation, addresses the central issues within the specialty area, and reviews the pertinent literature. Advanced Course or Minor Requirements—The candidate must complete 12 units of advanced graduate course work or a Ph.D. minor in another department. If a student waives the minor requirement in favor of the 12 advanced units, the student must fulfill the advanced course requirement by taking (a) non-core graduate courses required by a particular area,or (b) graduate-level courses in other departments comparable in quality to Psychology's graduate courses.<query> what is the cada</query> If there is any question about comparability, the student should consult the adviser, student services, and, in some cases, the graduate program committee chair before taking the course. Orals—The candidate must pass the University oral examination, which also serves as a dissertation defense. A committee is formed to review the oral examination, including the dissertation reading committee, an additional faculty member, and one oral examination committee chair from outside the Psychology department. The oral examination consists of a 40-45-minute presentation to the department of the completed dissertation research. Parents and friends are welcome to attend. Following the presentation, the student and the committee convene for a discussion of the dissertation and the presentation. Dissertation Requirements—The candidate must complete a dissertation satisfactory to the dissertation reading committee prior to the oral examination. Minor revisions to formatting may be made after the oral examination.<query> how long is the oral examination</query> Ph.D. candidacy expires five years after admission to candidacy at the end of the second year of study. Reapplication requires department reexamination. STUDENT EVALUATIONS First-Year Evaluation—It is the department's policy to evaluate the progress of each graduate student at the end of the first year of graduate study. As part of the procedure, each student is required to file with the department a report of the first-year research activities. Students should discuss this report and the evaluation procedures with their adviser as early as possible in their first year. If the student fulfills the academic promise displayed upon entrance, he or she is invited to continue working towards the doctorate. The first-year evaluation is primarily based on three factors: quality of research carried out in the first year performance in courses (especially required courses) recommendations of the adviser (including a commitment on the part of that adviser to continue in that role).<query> how long does a phd candidate have to be evaluated</query> Second-Year and Beyond Evaluation—A similar evaluation is conducted at the end of each year of graduate training involving the same criteria as the first year; however, the student is not required to submit a paper. Students who are not making satisfactory progress may be dropped from the program. THE DOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM As indicated by the requirements described above, a student concentrates in any one of several areas within Psychology. Regardless of area, however, the training program places emphasis on the development of research competence, and students are encouraged to develop those skills and attitudes that are appropriate to a career of continuing research productivity. Two kinds of experience are necessary for this purpose. One is the learning of substantial amounts of technical information. A number of courses and seminars are provided to assist in this learning, and a student is expected to work out a program, with his or her adviser, to attain this knowledge in the most stimulating and economical fashion.<query> what is the purpose of a doctoral training program</query>"

Introduction proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end.<query> what is computer programming</query> Just to give you a feel for what programming is like in a high-level language, here's a program that greets us, pretending to know English. print [Hello world!] This is one of the simplest programs that can be written in most high-level languages. PRINT is a command in Logo When it is performed, it takes whatever follows it and displays it. The ""Hello world"" program is famous;checkout its description on Wikipedia by clicking here. In addition to commands, Logo has operators that output some sort of result. Although it's a bit contrived, here is a program that displays the product of a constant number (ten) and a random number in the range of zero through fourteen. print product 10 (random 15) In this code, the PRINT command's input is the output of the PRODUCT operator. PRODUCT multiplies whatever follows it by whatever follows that and outputs the result. So,PRODUCT needs two inputs. RANDOM is an operator that outputs a number that is greater than or equal to zero (0) and less than the number following it. So, PRODUCT gets its second input from the output of RANDOM.<query> what is the print command in logo</query> Confusing? Don't worry, we will get into the details of operators in lesson 8. Finally, here's an advanced snipet of a program written in Logo, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. Here is a procedure definition for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers. to getMax :maxNum :numList if empty? : numList [output :maxNum] if greater? (first :numList) :maxNum [output getMax (first :numList) (butfirst :numList)] output getMax :maxNum (butfirst :numList) end Do not worry if this seems confusing. It will be a while before you will be writing anything like this. But, I want you to see that the words that make up the program's instructions and the instructions themselves are similar to English sentences, e.g., the first line and a half in the procedure are similar to the sentences: If the list of numbers to process is empty then output the maximum number processed.<query> what is the procedure for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers</query> If the first number in the list is greater than the maximum number processed so far then ... So, a high-level programming language is *sort-of* like English, just one step closer to what the language a computer really understands looks like. Now let's move on to what a computer's native language looks like when it is given a symbolic representation. Programming Languages (Assembler Language) One step above a computer's native language is assembler language. In an assembler language, everything is given human-friendly symbolic names. The programmer works with operations that the microprocessor knows how to do, they have symbolic names. The microprocessor's registers and addresses in the computer's memory can also be given meaningful names by the programmer. This is actually a very big step over what a computer understands, but still tedious for writing a large program. Assembler language instructions still have a place for little snipits of software that need to interact directly with the microprocessor and/or those that are executed many, many, many times.<query> what language is used to write a program</query> Table 1.1 is an example of DEC PDP-10 assembler language, a function that returns the largest integer in a group of them, named NUMARY. The group contains NCOUNT elements. Label OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register Comment GETMAX: MOVSI T1 400000 ; init T1 to smallest integer MOVE T2 NCOUNT ; get number of array elements GTMAX2: SOJL T2 [POPJ P,] ; decr idx, if -1 then done CAMG T1 NUMARY (T2) ; skip if T1 > array element JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number MOVE T1 NUMARY (T2) ; T1 gets new max number JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number Table 1.1 I'm showing you this so that you will have a feel for how primitive computer instruction sets are. I'm not going to go into the details of every instruction. If you want to go through it in detail on your own, the PDP-10 Machine Language is detailed here.<query> what is the function of pdp</query> A few points I want to expose you to are the general kinds of things being done. moving objects (numbers) into the computer's registers - very fast temporary storage, decrementing the value in a register, comparing the contents of a register to some value in memory, and transfering control to an instruction that's not in the standard sequential order - down the page. So, as you've seen, higher-level programming languages provide similar functionality and in a form that is closer to the English language. But there is a problem with assembler language - it is unique for every computer architecture. Although most deskside and notebook computers these days use the Intel architecture, this is only recently the case. And... a variety of computer architectures are commonly used in game systems, smart phones, tablets, automobiles, appliances, etc... Ok, we are almost at a point where I can show you machine language, the *native* language of a computer. But for you to understand it, I'm going to have to explain how everything is represented in a computer.<query> what language is used in computers</query> Inside Computers - Bits and Pieces Your computer successfully creates the illusion that it contains photographs, letters, songs, and movies. All it really contains is bits, lots of them, patterned in ways you can't see. Your computer was designed to store just bits - all the files and folders and different kinds of data are illusions created by computer programmers. (Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis, in ""Blown to Bits"") Basically, computer instructions perform operations on groups of bits. A bit is either on or off, like a lightbulb. Figure 1.1_a shows an open switch and a lightbulb that is off - just like a transistor in a computer represents a bit with the value: zero. Figure 1.1_b shows the switch in the closed position and the lightbulb is on, again just like a transistor in a computer representing a bit with the value: one.<query> what is the difference between a bit and a bit</query> Figure 1.1_a Figure 1.1_b A microprocessor, which is the heart of a computer, is very primitive but very fast. It takes groups of bits and moves around their contents, adds pairs of groups of bits together, subtracts one group of bits from another, compares a pair of groups, etc... - that sort of stuff. Inside a microprocessor, at a very low level, everything is simply a bunch of switches, also known as bits - things that are either on or off! Time to expand on how this is done; first let's explore how groups of bits can be used to form numbers. Numeric Representation With Bits There are only 10 different kinds of people in the world: those who know binary and those who don't. - Anonymous Computers are full of zillions of bits that are either on or off. The way we talk about the value of a bit in the electical engineering and computer science communities is first as a logical value (true if on, false if off) and secondly as a binary number (1 if the bit is on and 0 if it's off). Most bits in a computer are manipulated in groups, so we humans need a way to describe groups of bits, things/objects a computer manipulates. Today, bits are most often grouped in quantities of 8, 16, 32, and 64.<query> what is the microprocessor used for</query> Think about how you write down sequential numbers starting with zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc... Our decimal number system has ten symbols. In this sequential series, when we ran out of symbols, we combined them. You learned how to do this so long ago, in grade school, that today you just naturally think in terms of single digit numbers, then tens, hundreds, thousands, etc... The decimal number 1234 is one thousand, two hundreds, three tens, and four units. So, how does the binary number system used inside computers work? Well, with only two symbols, we would write the same sequential numbers as above: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011. The decimal number 1234 in binary is 10011010010. Since even reasonable numbers that we use all the time make for very long binary numbers, the bits are grouped in 3s and 4s which are simple to convert into numbers in the octal and hexadecimal number systems. For octal, we group three bits together. Take the binary equivilent of decimal 1234, 10011010010, and put spaces in between each group of three bits - starting at the right and going left.<query> what is the decimal number for 111</query> 10011010010 = 10 011 010 010 Now use the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (eight symbols, so OCTAL) to replace each group. 10 011 010 010 = 2 3 2 2 = 2322 The octal representations of the binary patterns are certainly easier to read, write, and remember than the binary counterparts. An even more compact representation can be achieved by grouping the bits in chunks of four and converting these to hexNumerals. When you group four bits together and use sixteen symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, A, B, C, D, E, and F) as their abbreviations, you have a hexadecimal representation.<query> what is the symbol for octal</query> 10011010010 = 100 1101 0010 = 4D2 As you continue to explore how computers work, you'll hear more about numbers expressed in octal and hex; these are just more manageable representations of binary information -the digital world. Table 1.2 compares the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems. Decimal Number in Binary in Octal in Hex 1 1 1 1 2 10 2 2 3 11 3 3 4 100 4 4 5 101 5 5 6 110 6 6 7 111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 9 1001 11 9 10 1010 12 A 11 1011 13 B 12 1100 14 C 13 1101 15 D 14 1110 16 E 15 1111 17 F 16 10000 20 10 Table 1.2 So, if the most common groupings of bits in a computer are 8, 16, 32, and 64, what kinds of numbers can these groups represent?<query> what is the hexadecimal number</query> pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something. An example would be to get weather information from the net and display it. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know. But, since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you need to know a little bit about how a computer works. Your job will be to instruct the computer to do things. Basically, writing software (computer programs) is describing how to do something. In its simplest form, it is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something - aprocess, a procedure. The lists of instructions that you will write are computer programs, and the stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, graphics, etc...<query> what is the definition of procedure</query> A group of eight bits has binary values 00000000 through 11111111, or expressed in decimal 0 through 255. A group of sixteen bits has binary values 0000000000000000 through 1111111111111111, or decimal 0 through 65535. I'm not going to type in binary representations for groups of 32 and 64 bits. The range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits is 0 through 4,294,967,295. The range of decimal values for a group of 64 bits is 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -or almost eighteen and a half quintillion. But wait... these numbers are all positive (Whole Numbers). If we are going to allow for subtraction operations on numbers, which can result in negative numbers, we need Integers. Modern computers use one bit in each of the groups to represent the sign (positive or negative) when the groups are used to represent integers. Table 1.3 shows the range of numbers that can be represented with groups of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits.<query> what is the range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits</query> Number of Bits Unsigned Maximum Value Signed Minimum Value Signed Maximum Value 8 255 -128 127 16 65535 -32768 32767 32 4,294,967,295 -2,147,483,648 2,147,483,647 64 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Table 1.3 That's about as deep as I want to get into the representation of numbers in computers and the binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems. Yes, computers have division operators but I am not going to cover numbers that include fractional parts, i.e., the""rational"" and ""irrational"" numbers due to the complexity of their implementations. If you want to read more, I googled and found what looks like a good place for you to read more. Start atAll About Circuits - Systems of numeration and read through it and continue on for a few more web pages in the series.<query> what is the number of bits in a hexadecimal number</query> Symbols as Bits - ASCII Characters Ok, so numbers are simply groups of bits. What other objects will the computer's instructions manipulate? How about the symbols that make up an alphabet? It should come as no surprise that symbols that make up alphabets are just numbers, groups of bits, too. But how do we know which numbers are used to represent which symbols, or characters as I'm going to call them from this point on? It's all about standards. In these lessons, we will use the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) standard. It is so ubiquious that it even has its own web page,www.asciitable.com. Let's walk through a couple of examples, entries in the table. Here are some characters, their decimal value and their binary value which is then transformed into an octal number.<query> what is the ascii symbol</query> Uppercase 'A' = decimal 65 = binary 01000001 = 01 000 001 = octal 101 Uppercase 'Z' = decimal 90 = binary 01011010 = 01 011 010 = octal 132 The digit '1' = decimal 49 = binary 00110001 = 00 110 001 = octal 061 Table 1.4 is a small slice from the full ASCII character set, just enough to give you a flavor of its organization.

You can convert uppercase to lowercase by turning on a single bit. Or clearing the bit converts lowercase to uppercase. Clearing two bits will convert an ASCII digit to its numeric value. Setting the same bits converts a number in the range 0...9 into its ASCII character representation. Check Your Understanding So Far Take a moment to see if you understand the explanation of binary numbers. HERE is a jlogo program that converts an 8-bit byte into numbers and ASCII characters. Try it out! . Pixels The image on your computer's display consists of a bunch of colored points called pixels. A pixel is an object. It has a color and a position (its coordinates) which consists of the row and column it is at. Figure 1.1 shows an artist's rendition, a magnification of a display with a circle drawn in yellow.<query> convert numbers to ascii</query> The tiny black dots are the pixels and the big yellow dots are the pixels that have been colored. Figure 1.1 As an example, to display a thin vertical line, the color values of a column of pixels are set to the desired color of the line. If you want a thicker vertical line, you set the color values of the pixels of a group of consecutive columns to the desired color. Figure 1.2 shows a red line that's a single pixel wide and an orange line that's three pixels wide. The orange line is actually a very thin rectangle. Figure 1.2 So, the location of each pixel is obviously specified by a pair of numbers; what about the pixel's color? Well... a pixel's color is also specified as numbers, three of them, called RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. Play with the following Java applet which lets you see what number values generate which colors. What color do you get if you set red to 170, green to 85, and blue to 255? What's the RGB value for your favorite color?<query> what is the color of a pixel</query> alt=""Your browser understands the <APPLET> tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."" Your browser is completely ignoring the <APPLET> tag! Color Numbers Applet So, just as groups of bits represent numbers and symbols, they are used to form pixels. Ok... I've exposed you to a variety of objects that you commonly see when you are using a computer, things that can be manipulated with instructions in a computer programming language. Now let's move on to the computer's instructions, one more thing that is just a bunch of bits! Programming Languages (The Microprocessor's Language) So, all a computer has in it is bits. You've seen how they are used to represent stuff, pixels, numbers and characters. I've mentioned that computers perform operations on the bits, like move them around, add pairs of them together, etc... One final obvious question is: how are instructions that a computer performs represented?<query> what is the computer program used for</query> Well, if you instructed a computer in its native language (machine language), you would have to write instructions in the form of (yes, once again) binary numbers. This is very, VERY hard to do. Although the pioneers of computer science did this, no one does this these days. Just to give you something to look at, just to compare, Table 1.5 shows what the assembler language program in Table 1.1 could look like assuming that the machine instructions are loaded into memory at addresses 100 through 107. Also, the group of numbers starts at memory address 111 and the size of the group is in memory address 110. Address OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register 100 205 1 400000 101 200 2 110 102 361 2 107 103 317 1 111 2 104 254 102 105 200 1 111 2 106 254 102 107 263 17 Address Value 110 67 111 47316 . . . 177 2751 Table 1.5 A detailed explanation of any computer's instruction set is beyond what can be presented here. I just wanted you to see how the symbolic information in assembler language programs needs to be converted to numbers (bits) before a computer can perform it. If you really want more details now, here is a side lesson from one of my favorite introductory computer science books: The Computer Continuum.<query> what is the memory address of assembler language</query> The lesson walks you through programming a very simple robot computer. And, I wrote a simulator for the Robot Computer in jLogo that you can play with HERE. Summary Computer programming is composing/authoring of a process/procedure for doing something, in great detail. proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end. pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Since computers do not understand English and it would be impossible for a human to write a large program as a series of binary numbers that the computer can understand, we need something in between. High-level programming languages currently fit in this category. Given a programming language that you have chosen, you then follow its rules for composing statements (or expressions) that get the computer to do what you want.<query> what is computer programming</query> Because a computer is simply a very fast manipulator of bits (ones and zeros), through the the power of abstraction, computer scientists have layered levels of object representation and functionality, one on top of another. We have now been working on refining and extending these layers for over half of a century. Table 1.6 should give you a feel for where we stand with computer programming languages today. In the next lesson you'll start to write programs in Logo! Application-Specific Language(4GL) Examples: Mathematica, SQL High-Level Language Examples: Logo, Python Low-Level Language Example: C Assembler Language Example: Intel X86 Machine Language Example: Intel X86 Table 1.6 Exercise Cisco's Learning Network provides a game where you can test your ability to do binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions.<query> what language is logo</query> So, writing a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff. It has been argued that in its current state it is anart, not engineering. An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it. One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb but obedient. It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted. Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression. A deep understanding of programming, in particular the notions of successive decomposition as a mode of analysis and debugging of trial solutions, results in significant educational benefits in many domains of discourse, including those unrelated to computers and information technology per se.<query> why do you need to learn to program a computer</query> Click here to go to the website to test your ability.

Actually a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to a computer, i.e., express it as an algorithm."" (Donald Knuth, in ""American Mathematical Monthly,"" 81) Computers have proven immensely effective as aids to clear thinking. Muddled and half-baked ideas have sometimes survived for centuries because luminaries have deluded themselves as much as their followers or because lesser lights, fearing ridicule, couldn't summon up the nerve to admit that they didn't know what the Master was talking about. A test as near foolproof as one could get of whether you understand something as well as you think is to express it as a computer program and then see if the program does what it is supposed to.<query> how to understand something</query> Computers are not sycophants and won't make enthusiastic noises to ensure their promotion or camouflage what they don't know. What you get is what you said. (James P. Hogan in ""Mind Matters"") But, most of all, it can be lots of fun! An associate once said to me ""I can't believe I'm paid so well for something I love to do."" Just what do instructions a computer understands look like? And, what kinds of objects do the instructions manipulate? By the end of this lesson you will be able to answer these questions. But first let's try to write a program in the English language. Programming Using the English Language Remember what I said in the Introduction to this lesson? Writing software, computer programs, is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something.<query> what do computer instructions look like</query> Before we see what a computer programming language looks like, let's use the English language to describe how to do something as a series of steps. A common exercise that really gets you thinking about what computer programming can be like is to describe a process you are familiar with. Describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Rather than write my own version of this exercise, I searched the Internet for the words ""computer programming sandwich"" usingGoogle. One of the hits returned was http://teachers.net/lessons/posts/2166.html. At the link, Deb Sweeney (Tamaqua Area Middle School, Tamaqua, PA) described the problem as: Objective: Students will write specific and sequential steps on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Procedure: Students will write a very detailed and step-by-step paragraph on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for homework.<query> what is the computer programming language</query> The next day, the students will then input (read) their instructions to the computer (teacher). The teacher will then ""make"" the programs, being sure to do exactly what the students said... When this exercise is directed by an experienced teacher or mentor it is excellent for demonstrating how careful you need to be, how detailed you need to be, when writing a computer program. Here is teacher/mentor support material. Programming in a natural language, say the full scope of the English language, seems like a very difficult task. But, before moving on to languages we can write programs in today, I want to leave on a high note. Click here to read about how Stephen Wolfram sees programming in a natural language happening. Programming Languages (High-Level Languages) Almost all of the computer programming these days is done with high-level programming languages. There are lots of them and some are quite old. COBOL, FORTRAN, and Lisp were devised in the 1950s!!! As you will see, high-level languages make it easier to describe the pieces of the program you are creating. They help by letting you concentrate on what you are trying to do rather than that and how you fit it into a computer architecture. Theyabstract away the specifics of the microprocessor in your computer. And, all come with large sets of common stuff you need to do, called libraries.<query> what language do you use to write a program</query> In this introduction to programming, you will work with two computer languages: Logo and Java. Logo comes from Bolt, Beranek & Newman (BBN) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Seymour Papert, a scientist at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, championed this computer programming language in the 70s. More research of its use in educational settings exists than for any other programming language. In fact, the fairly newScratch Programming Language (also from MIT) consists of a modern graphical environment on top of Logo-like functionality. Java is a fairly recent programming language. It appeared in 1995 just as the Internet was starting to get lots of attention. Java was invented by James Gosling, working at Sun Microsystems. It's sort-of a medium-level language. One of the big advantages of learning Java is that there is a lot of software already written ( see: Java Class Library) which will help you write graphical programs that run on the Internet. You get to take advantage of software that thousands of programmers have already written. Java is used in a variety of applications, from mobile phones to massive Internet data manipulation. You get to work with window objects, Internet connection objects, database access objects and thousands of others. Java is the language used to write Android apps.<query> what is the difference between java and logo</query> So, why do these lessons start with the Logo programming language? I like the Logo language to teach introductory programming with because it is very easy to learn. The faster you get to write interesting computer programs the more fun you will have. And... having fun is important! But do not let Logo's simplicity fool you into thinking it is just a toy programming language. Logo is a derivative of the Lisp programming language, a very powerful language still used today to tackle some of the most advanced research being performed. Brian Harvey shows the power of Logo in hisComputer Science Logo Style series of books. Volume 3: Beyond Programming covers six college-level computer science topics with Logo. Both Logo and Java have the same sort of stuff needed to write computer programs. . They have the ability to manipulate objects including lots of arithmetic functions, you can compare objects and do different things depending on the outcome of the comparison, and they provide ways to control the order in which instructions get performed. And... that's what programming is really all about... as you will see.<query> what is logo programming language</query>"

Given the option, would you choose a gooey hot fudge sundae or a granola bar? A double cheeseburger or a double helping of green veggies? For many of us, eating healthy is harder than it sounds, especially when temptations abound. But thanks to the January 15, 2010 release of the Ministry of Education’s new School Food and Beverage Policy (PPM 150) making responsible food choices is about to get a lot easier for students across Ontario.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> Provincial funding operates within a broader scope of contributors to deliver the program, including parents or caregivers, corporate sponsors, farmers, local charities, community organizations and municipalities. The SNP Nutrition Guidelines follow Canada’s Food Guide and apply to foods served in programs. Guiding principals for the nutrition guidelines include: promote healthy eating, prepare healthy food, respect diversity and individual needs, contribute to social development, choose Ontario food first, be environmentally conscious and practice safe food handling and storage. To learn more about SNP or to download a copy of the SNP Nutrition Guidelines please visit the MCYS website at:www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/schoolsnacks/index.aspx Another piece of the ‘Healthy School’ puzzle is falling into place...

And while the planning of new menus and food options is sure to be a big job, requiring the support of the entire school community, it is clearly a change that is worth making. Not only is the availability of healthy foods in schools bound to result in better eating habits and increased concentration levels for students but, perhaps most importantly, by reinforcing the knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding healthy living that are being taught through the revised Ontario Health and Physical Education Curriculum and encouraged by initiatives such as Foundations for a Healthy School, it is sure to send a strong message to students: Healthy eating habits are important... so important, in fact, that we are willing to work hard to ensure that our school environments support us all in making healthier choices.<query> why is healthy eating important in schools</query> View All Articles Post new comment Subject: Comment: * CAPTCHA This question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.

What this means is that choosing nutritious foods more often won’t only be encouraged, it will become an integral part of every school’s culture—something that we at Ophea could not be happier about. “Ophea shares the government’s commitment to healthy schools and healthy communities and believes that Ontario’s new School Food and Beverage Policy is a critical step that will reinforce the philosophy and expectations of the revised H&PE curriculum,” comments Chris Markham, Ophea’s executive director and CEO.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> “It will foster a healthier learning environment and help students reach their full potential.” Good nutrition leads to better health and better learning... It’s simple enough to do the math. With 195 days in a typical school year, Ontario students are eating most of their lunches at school. Whether these lunches are purchased in cafeterias or brought from home and supplemented with snacks from school vending machines, they often include high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium, low nutrient foods such as fries, candy bars and sugary drinks. ""When our school board introduced nutrition standards in 2007, it was because we knew that a healthy diet would lead to more active and engaged students. The results have been outstanding,"" says Roger Lawler, Director of Education at the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. As the link between improved health and improved learning outcomes has been proven time and time again, and the connections between poor nutrition and chronic disease have been well documented, it’s become increasingly clear: poor nutrition is a problem that we, as a society, can no longer afford to ignore, and one that we all have a responsibility not to perpetuate.<query> why is nutrition important in school</query> Furthermore, the need to set a strong example for students by ‘practicing what we preach’ in schools cannot be understated. Through the implementation of Daily Physical Activity (DPA), the forging of community partnerships and the adoption of the Ministry of Education’s Foundations for a Healthy School framework, schools have already begun to take a more comprehensive approach to improving student health. But while positive health messages are taught and physical activity has been made a priority, the foods currently sold in schools often fail to support and reinforce what students are learning about healthy living. It’s time to make a change, and there’s never been a better time to get started! As schools begin to adopt the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum (Grades 1-8)—which not only provides information about health education but also builds students’ capacity to make healthy choices—the new policy will help to ensure greater alignment between what students are being taught and the food choices that are available, helping them to apply what they’re learning while fostering healthy habits that can last a lifetime.<query> why is physical education important in schools</query> The policy applies to all foods sold in schools... The new policy applies to foods and beverages sold on school premises for school purposes including all venues, such as cafeterias, vending machines and tuck shops. It also applies to all programs (for example, catered lunch programs) and must be enforced at all events, including bake sales and sports competitions. Exceptions to the policy will include foods and beverages that are: offered in schools at no cost; brought from home or purchased off school premises; available for purchase during field trips off school premises; sold in schools for non-school purposes (e.g., sold by an outside organization using the school gym after school hours and for non school-related events); sold for fundraising activities that occur off school premises; and sold in staff rooms. Under the policy, school principals may also elect to designate up to 10 days (or fewer as determined by the school board) during the school year as “special-event days” on which foods and beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards may be sold.<query> what is the policy for food sold in schools</query> The healthiest foods have the highest nutritional values... The policy groups foods and beverages into three categories: “The Sell Most Category” must make up at least 80% of choices offered. These foods and beverages generally have higher levels of essential nutrients and lower levels of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples may include fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits and vegetables; and whole grain breads. “The Sell Less Category” must make up no more than 20% of choices offered. These foods have slightly higher amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium than the ‘Sell Most Category.’ Examples may include deli meats, frozen pizza and hotdogs. Foods that are in the “Not Permitted for Sale Category” are generally those that contain few or no essential nutrients and high amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium.<query> what is the sell most category for food</query> Examples include deep fried foods, energy bars and candy. More information about the criteria for determining a food’s suitability can be found inThe School Food & Beverage Policy itself. When it comes to implementation, help is readily available... Throughout the winter of 2010, school board teams and principals will receive training from the Ministry of Education in how to implement the new policy, and further information about implementation support can be found at www.ontario.ca/healthyschools. As with any new policy or initiative, getting started is the hardest part. School boards are encouraged to reach out to students, staff, parents, community partners and food service providers in order to gain their support. School boards should also seek support from their local board of health, as they have been mandated under the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2008 to work with school boards and/or staff in elementary, secondary and post-secondary educational settings, using a comprehensive health promotion approach.<query> what is the ontario school food policy</query> The goal of this collaboration is to influence the development and implementation of healthy policies, and the creation or enhancement of supportive environments to address healthy eating and other key health issues (including physical activity, alcohol use and tobacco control). For more information on working with your local board of health, see www.ophea.net/healthy-schools-communities/making-it-happen/step-3. Schools and communities can also access the following sources for further information and for support for healthy eating: Eat Right Ontario – This is an initiative of the Ministry of Health Promotion. Through this program, schools (or other interested parties) can access a registered dietician by phone or by email to answer any questions they have about healthy eating. Their website, www.eatrightontario.ca, also contains a wealth of information about diabetes prevention, menu planning, and health and nutrition, as well as a listing of healthy recipes.<query> what is the health promotion program for schools</query> Menu of Choices – This online resource, published by Ophea, provides the latest quality information and supports to help school communities understand, plan and address healthy eating. The website, www.menuofchoices.ca, which encourages entire school communities to take a proactive approach to addressing the eating behaviours of children and youth (Grades K-12), can be accessed by all educators and community partners who want to help students develop a personal commitment to healthy eating. Student Nutrition Program (SNP) – This Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) program supports communities to provide nutritious food to children and youth. The program supports the healthy growth and development of children and youth by providing universal access to nutritious meals and snacks at each site so students are ready to learn. SNP is a community-driven initiative.

Source: esha Research, Food Processor for Windows, Version 7.8M Whole Grains and Fish Highly Protective against Childhood Asthma<query> how much fiber in a cup of oatmeal</query> While no association between asthma and intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was found (a result at odds with other studies that have supported a link between antioxidant intake, particularly vitamins C and E, and asthma), the children's intake of both whole grains and fish was significantly linked to incidence of wheezing and current asthma. In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed. Phenolics, powerful antioxidants that work in multiple ways to prevent disease, are one major class of phytonutrients that have been widely studied. Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods.

Store quinoa in an airtight container. It will keep for a longer period of time, approximately three to six months, if stored in the refrigerator. Tips for Preparing and Cooking Tips for Preparing Quinoa While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands. To ensure that the saponins have been completely removed, taste a few seeds. If they still have a bitter taste, continue the rinsing process.<query> how long can you keep quinoa in the refrigerator</query> This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Quinoa provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System.

In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients. Because quinoa is a very good source of manganese as well as a good source of magnesium, folate, and phosphorus, this ""grain"" may be especially valuable for persons with migraine headaches, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Help for Migraine Headaches If you are prone to migraines, try adding quinoa to your diet. Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years. Arch Intern Med. 2007 Mar 12;167(5):490-6.; Eur Heart J. 2006 Mar;27(6):641-3. Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5.

Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women. (Cade JE, Burley VJ, et al. ,International Journal of Epidemiology).<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Pre-menopausal women eating the most fiber (>30 grams daily) more than halved their risk of developing breast cancer, enjoying a 52% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women whose diets supplied the least fiber (<20 grams/day). Fiber supplied by whole grains offered the most protection. Pre-menopausal women eating the most whole grain fiber (at least 13 g/day) had a 41% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest whole grain fiber intake (4 g or less per day). Fiber from fruit was also protective. Pre-menopausal women whose diets supplied the most fiber from fruit (at least 6 g/day) had a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest fruit fiber intake (2 g or less per day).<query> what is the best fiber for premenopausal women</query>"
clueweb12-0807wb-18-17189,9,2,"Why Windows Wins | Linux Magazine Distros SysAdmin Mobile Software Datacenter HPC Development LMTV Why Windows Wins Windows Vista: The kinda boring, soon to be globally dominant operating system. By Bryan Richard Thursday, February 1st, 2007 General availability for Microsoft Windows Vista went live this week to reserved applause. The reviews seem to think it’s a decent upgrade to the OS but not something you need to camp out overnight at Best Buy for. What fascinates me most about the Vista launch is the limited number of computers in the world that are capable of running the software today. How many companies can spend $6 billion on a product that can only be deployed on an estimated 15% of the world’s computers?<query> why does windows win</query> It’s like building one billion cars and there being only 5 roads to drive them on. It’s seems a bit reckless in one sense. But it’s also rather brilliant. Windows Vista isn’t so much a new operating system as it is demand generation for new hardware. It’s a strategy that ultimately will prove successful because it enlists the support ofeveryone selling hardware. No Room for Change Microsoft is in bit of an awkward position for a software company. They can’t really produce a revolutionary computing experience that deviates too far from the Windows of previous releases. It’s not for lack of talent or manpower but because with such a large install base, introducing anything that’s too foreign, regardless if it’s better or not, would throw users into a tailspin. Look at it this way, if everyone that was running Windows suddenly switched, at the same time, to the Mac you’d have 90% of the world’s computer users spending the next 30 days just trying to find their files.<query> why is windows vista a good operating system</query> Anyone that’s had to answer the question, “Linux… that can get eBay, right?” will know this to be true. That’s not a comment on the intelligence of your average computer user but an observation that most users can only tolerate change in very small doses. And it’s this wave computing inertia that Microsoft is able to ride and Desktop Linux struggles to stay afloat in. So, if you’re Microsoft and you can’t create something so new that in and of itself it’s inherently compelling, what are your options? Oddly enough the best option seems to be to create something that most people can’t use. Built for the Computers of 2009! Let’s quickly compare the hardware requirements of Windows Vista and the most recent commercial desktop available, Novell SUSE Enterprise Linux Desktop 10. Figures pulled from the respective vendor’s websites: Windows Vista Premium Ready SLED 10 Processor 1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor Intel Pentium III 500 MHz or higher processor System Memory 1 GB 512 MB GPU Windows Aero Capable DirectX 9-class GPU that supports: A WDDM Driver Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware 32 bits per pixel Adequate graphics memory n/a Graphics Memory 128 MB n/a HDD 40 GB n/a HDD Free Space >15 GB 2.5 GB Optical Drive DVD-ROM Drive n/a Truth be told, I’ve got an ancient IBM ThinkPad 600 lying around here somewhere that would probably run SLED 10 well enough — that’s the great thing about Linux, it’s light enough to run on just about anything.<query> what is the minimum hardware requirements for linux desktop</query> But if you are a hardware manufacturer, which column above you get more excited? Windows Vista will help PC vendors sell more desktops than Linux will. Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer told Reuters, “We will see an uptick (in PC sales). Sales will be stronger than they otherwise would have been.” If you’re cost-conscious or your department has a tight IT budget, you might disagree, but Ballmer is correct. And not only that, but PC vendors will drive the majority of new Vista sales. While Microsoft won’t spin down the marketing engine anytime soon, in a sense, their work was over once they released Vista because it created so much incentive for hardware vendors to sell Vista for them. People Like to Buy Stuff Regardless if it’s a home user or a enterprise department of 1,000, people like to buy things.<query> what is the microsoft ceo saying about vista</query> The only thing they perhaps like more than buying things is the justification to make a purchase. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading a computer, Vista just gave you, without a doubt, the answer to every question related to “Why do we need to buy a new PC?” For someone like myself that has purchased exactly three computers in the last 10 years, it seems a little foolish, but it’s how the majority of the PC buying patterns work. On top of buying habits, Microsoft will add some additional incentive in the form of discontinuing free support for XP in 2008 to draw in the hold-outs, but in general, the trend will follow that if you’re running the previous OS from Microsoft, you’ll soon be running the latest. I can see no reason why this should suddenly change. Linux on the Desktop Linux on the desktop needs strong support from groups outside the Linux community and I’m not sure that exists yet.<query> why do we need to buy a new computer</query> Those who have already sampled the Kool-Aid have drank deeply. I think the biggest question is whether the commercial Linux distributions can prove to the PC vendors that it is in their best interest to support Linux on the desktop. I for one used the same Linux laptop for five years before switching to the Mac. No PC vendor wants to hear that. Then again, no Linux user wants to hear that their favorite distro is a suddenly a giant piece of bloat-ware. It’s a fine line but one that needs to be walked. Otherwise Linux on the desktop will continue to sit somewhere South of Apple’s 4-5% market share. That’s Apple Inc., mind you, who recently changed their name from Apple Computer having realized that in most cases the world beats a path to your door when you build a better mousetrap.<query> what is the market share of linux on desktop</query> But maybe not for a better desktop.

clueweb12-0003wb-78-25177,9,2,"How to Give Linux Away LG #125 ...making Linux just a little more fun! <-- prev | next --> How to Give Linux Away By Scott Ruecker As a community, we would like to see large computer manufacturers sell PCs with Linux already on them. Is this the only option worth considering? I work as a sales representative for one of the large PC manufacturers, at many different technology retail stores. Three years ago, I heard about Open Source and Linux. My first exposure came in the form of the Firefox browser. When I speak with customers, I talk about my experiences using Linux. I ask them if their computer is running slow, and the answer is always ""Yes"". They tell me how it is running really slow no matter what they do, or how they can't seem to create any free room on their hard drive.<query> what is linux given away</query> If I do it right, they do not even feel their own shift in opinion or preference. I could expand on this some more, and I will, but I thought that giving you the basics of what I do might help others in getting past theFUD without alienating the person you are talking to. Changing someone's opinion or stance without making them feel stupid takes practice - and I get a lot of practice. Talkback: Discuss this article with The Answer Gang Scott Ruecker a.k.a. ""sharkscott"" lives in Phoenix, Arizona; he is a Special Education Major at Arizona State University and claims to have taken way too many History Classes. He works as a sales rep for a large OEM, tries to pronounce ""Linux"" correctly and plays Drums in a rock-n-roll band every Saturday night.<query> who is gang scott</query> First exposed to OSS when he heard about ""This Linux Thing"" in 2002. Got his start on the Fedora Cores, Ku-Ubuntu and then to SuSE. Has used SuSE since 9.1 and thinks he likes it. Copyright © 2006, Scott Ruecker.

Published in Issue 125 of Linux Gazette, April 2006 <-- prev | next --> Home FAQ Site Map Mirrors Translations Search Archives Authors Contact Us Home > April 2006 (#125) > Article<query> when was linux gazette published</query> People often ask me if MS-Office comes with the computer, and I say ""No, but have you ever heard ofOpenOffice.org?"" I tell them how it can read and save the MS formats, and how I have been using it at college even though MS-Office dominates on campus. I tell them what it can do and that it doesn't cost a dime. That usually gets their attention. I also will often hear the customer say, ""As soon as I get home I am going to throw the old computer away"". What I say at that point - and what I think we should all be saying - is ""You know that old computer that can't run Windows the way you need it to anymore? Give it to me, and I'll fix it up and give it to someone or some family that does not have a computer."" I have had several conversations with customers that have led to them giving me their old computers when buying a new one.<query> what is the name of the program that reads ms files</query> I fixed one up and gave it to a friend of mine who lives on a ranch in Colorado, and because of it he has been able to stay in contact with friends and family here in Phoenix. What if we all did that? All of us? What if everyone who used Linux fixed up an old computer, configured it for common uses, and gave it to someone or some family who did not have one? Think about it. We would not only double the number of people who use Linux, but have a very positive effect on society. We all know that having a computer in the home makes everyone who uses it read better. It is my belief that that the ability to read well does as much or more for that person as going to school. Someone who knows how to read can find what they need to learn the skills and teach themselves anything they want.<query> what if everyone who used linux fixed up an old computer and configured it for common uses If a child can be positively affected by having a computer, so can an entire family. I am not trying to proclaim some kind of ""call to arms"" to join me in some crusade - not at all. I just want to share some of the things I say, and some of the questions I ask, that have introduced Open Source Software to new people in a positive way. As the saying goes, ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression"". I hope that what I say in this article will help you make that first impression a good one. Over the last two years, I have gone from not knowing how to pronounce ""Linux"" correctly to... well, still not knowing how to pronounce SuSE correctly. You gotta admit, though - fixing up and giving away computers is at least good karma (I hope).<query> how to pronounce sue correctly</query> Part 2 - Changing Opinions If someone has already made up their mind not to give something new a try, then there is no sense in wasting your time trying make them re-think their decision. However, there are plenty of other people around - and some of them are only held back by excuses. Among those who give such excuses, there are those who are just repeating what they have heard or read and really do not have any of their own information or experience to draw from. They are easy to pick out - once you have heard hundreds of different people say almost the exact same thing like I have. It's not that hard; all you have to do is ask a few questions and you can easily determine if they are just repeating what they have heard or actually have their own reasons for not wanting to give Linux a try.<query> why do people say they won't give linux a try</query> Here is what I do: Ask them if they use IE, WMP (Windows Media Player), Quicktime, iTunes, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access... and always ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they are using. Make sure that you always end with the Anti-Viruses - trust me, I'll tell you why in a moment. You will find that roughly 99% of the people you talk to do not even use all of those programs I listed - and very, very few use any programs that are not on that list. Most people only use IE, Word, WMP, and maybe Quicktime a little - and whatever Anti-Virus software they have installed. Ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they use. After you ask, most people will repeat it back to you saying, ""How many types of Anti-Virus programs do I use?"" ""Do you have more than one Anti-Virus program on your computer?"" Some people do not - but many do use more than one.<query> what programs do people use on computers</query> This is where I tell them, ""When I ran Windows, I used Ad-Aware, Zone Alarm, AVG, McAfee (the free version), Spybot, Spywareblaster, Spyware-Doctor, Webroot, and Registry Mechanic."" Which is true: I had all of them on my computer at the same time and between them I could keep my system fairly safe. Fairly. Ask them if they have ever heard of Firefox. Some will ask, ""What is Firefox?"" - ""Firefox is a browser."" ""What is a browser?"" - ""It is a program that you use to surf the Internet."" ""You mean like IE?"" - ""Exactly, only it is a lot safer than IE."" This is where I go into the features, how it imports favorites and why it is safer than IE.<query> what is the difference between ie and firefox</query> Something like: ""Because it is not a part of the operating system, it is a lot harder for spyware to damage your system when using Firefox."" Again, technically true. Ask them if they have ever heard of OpenOffice.org. Then say to them, ""OpenOffice allows you to view, modify, save, and send the changed document in MS format and it does not cost $500... actually, it does not cost a dime."" I will tell you that a lot of people are not happy when they buy a new computer and then are told by the store employee that it does not come with Word or Office - and that if they want it, it will cost hundreds of dollars. If you can get people to listen to you about OpenOffice's compatibility features and price, of lack thereof, many will not leave until they get the web address from you.<query> does openoffice cost a dime</query> If I can get most of the way through these steps, then I know I can re-visit the Linux question and stand a chance of success. I can show them that it just might be something that could work for them. When I explain the Root and User separation built into Linux - how it makes the computer safer and that they will not need multiple Anti-Virus programs or have to re-format their hard drive every six months because Windows does not actually delete anything - they start to actually look at the retail Linux box I have already handed them. Is this system perfect? No. You may talk about one thing before another or skip over something or do it in reverse - every conversation is unique. I want to inform them of choices they may not have known of, open them up to new ways of doing something and not make them feel like they were wrong or stupid.<query> why is linux used</query>"

Published On :26 July,2010 If you will talk about developing a website with anyone, apart from gathering information about the type of website you need, an important (mandatory) question will come – “do you have any preference for the technology to be used for deploying this website?” Most of the time answer is a question back “What do you suggest?”, reason being clients are not tech savvy so they really do not understand this question.<query> what platform is linux</query> And it’s logical too, if I am associated with implementing the technology I can better understand this question and directly say .NET or PHP as the answer, but if I am a cloth merchant looking for a website this question will sound like Greek to me. Now here the service provider takes the advantage that they suggest the technology in which they expertise, rather it should be decided depending upon the nature of the application to be deployed, scope of the future enhancements and to an extent the budget the client has allotted for the same. While talking about deploying web based applications Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms. Now depending upon the platform of the server on which the site is to be hosted defines the options of the scripting languages and the database servers that can be used for developing the application. If we talk about Linux as the platform the most commonly used scripting languages includes – PHP, CGI, Perl, Python etc.<query> what is the most popular scripting language</query> For Windows platform the scripting languages used are ASP, ASP.NET, C#, Cold Fusion etc. For the database servers Linux offers support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase etc and MS SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle are the database servers of choice for Windows platform. Its not mandatory that these are the categorizations for the scripting languages and database servers for the said platforms, the scripting languages for Linux also come for as Windows binary and visa versa. Though there are certain differences among these two as listed below, but both of them are platforms of choice for deploying functionality rich web based applications: - - Linux is an open source freeware whereas Windows is a Microsoft brand. - Additional components for Linux are generally free whereas the components for Windows need to be purchased. - Linux is considered to be more virus proof then Windows - Web space for Linux being freeware is less costly then Windows - The cost of Linux web space includes the cost for database server whereas for windows if MS SQL server is opted it costs additional.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux</query> For the purposes of listing factors to choose which platform, we can say: - - The budget the client has for hosting. - If the specific requirement requires a specific component then identifying weather it is available with Windows or Linux - If the size of database is going to be huge MS SQL sever is preferred because of the additional features it offers for the data management. - Both Linux and Windows are equally reliable and robust, but yes on Windows special software are required for providing safety from hackers and non-authentic access. - Is the client specific about brand then Windows is the only choice. Thus to conclude, both these platform are platforms of choice for deploying feature rich websites and offer flexibilities of deploying interactive and data rich websites.

The really top institutions cannot be bought that way; for example Harvard's endowment is valued at $32 billion. It does help to have a parent who went to that college, especially if they are either unusually successful or consistently active in the alumni association. For everyone else the matter is straightforward: make certain there is no weak spot in your application (grades all B and above, etc.) and have something in your favor that 10,000 valedictorians don't have.

College applications are kind of an exercise in BS-ology. You have to groom this phony image of being well-rounded, interested in everything, nice enough to volunteer for ""good"" causes, etc. It's all BS. Fortunately, once you get to grad school, at least in science and engineering, all that fluff becomes irrelevant. In some European countries, the way you make it into the most prestigious universities is by taking an entrance exam. Everyone gets a grade and a rank based on it (no names show). Then they go down the list until all spots are filled.

FaceBook Twitter Email Share 27 Comments RSS 0 Like comment by Dave 486 days ago The US bishops seem to have been happy with the idea of a US universal health care system. I would think, not so much to extend coverage, which is clearly fairly good, but to make doing so less expensive, or probably more accurately justly sharing the burden. The more the US bishops and their associated hospitals can collect in excess money, the more we extend health coverage to other countries, just as we do now. It would be nice if they could set up medical schools in Africa, for instance, this would be a just remittance for their offering so many quality physicians to the US.<query> why is universal health care good</query> I personally, do not the the Federal government as the best venue (subsidiarity) for where to make this decision, but many states are demoralized and seem to rely on the fed for everything, rather than figuring their own stuff out. One thing to remember about the US health care system is that the rapidly rising health care costs are destabilizing the economy to some extent, but this seems to be based in the mass collection of wealth by the top 1%. Sad, but true, while my conservative use of government nature indicates that messing unnecessarily is bad, something about the current pay scale seems incredibly bad for mankind, really, the whole world is now subject to our ruling class. What exactly is basic health care is complicated in wealthy countries (which hip replacement? Which prosthesis?), but much less so in poorer countries.<query> why is the health care system bad</query> It is not that the US doesn't have hard decisions to make. What do we do? We have to leave stuff to the professionals, as the bishops would prefer, but we can't ignore death in the current plan, otherwise, aside from lying about it nature in other ways, it might be just fine. It's obviously true that increasing basic stuff in the West like cancer screenings (mammograms) are going to raise overall costs. If the US people got raising in line with company and economic growth in the country, it is unlikely that the increases in medical costs would be problem. People have the obligation to use the government for some things, level dependent on specific needs (venue size).

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world.<query> what is the benefit of telecommunications technology</query> As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.

If you are new here, you might want tosubscribe to the RSS feed for updates on this topic. “Oh no” I can hear you say, an article about education. Boring. Yet it should be one of the most exciting things you can read about. It is the education industry and their heritage that have made it boring. And if it is boring for us then just imagine how boring it must be for the victims of our current system.<query> why are classrooms obsolete</query> What seems more apt is that what schools do the most is provide the kind of parenting and socialization that games cannot provide. Most learning is socially constructed, distributed, and mediated. Where will they play these games and who will be their mentors then? #4 Robin on 03.31.09 at 2:56 pm I agree with Brock’s point that there still needs to be a face-to-face social element to child development, which technology can assist but not replace. I don’t agree that traditional school systems fulfil this role very effectively at all. There are too many arbitrary, outdated rules governing social interaction, organisation and time management. The adult environment that schools most closely resemble is prison, which should be a cause for concern. #5 Deirdre on 03.31.09 at 9:38 pm I homeschooled my daughter using a lot of educational games and she learned to be independent and problem focused.<query> what is the role of the school system in child development</query> Traditional high school was a terrible step backward for her, even the social aspect frustrated her because of the avoidance of learning even among the “best” students. So as a teacher, it is difficult for me to argue that the present method of schooling should continue. #6 Stone Bytes on 04.04.09 at 10:58 pm One teacher for a group of around five students top is what I call real, efficient and social education. Considering the crap taught in schools and how the educational systems in many countries are being destroyed year after year, I would not be surprised to hear about a rise of such educational methods. That internet based learning system is not good enough. There needs to be a true human contact. #7 Marshal Anderson on 04.14.09 at 7:40 pm I guess the problem I have with this is that it sets out games as /the solution/ to education, but that it doesn’t actually say what it takes education to be.<query> why is social education necessary</query> I don’t think anyone would disagree that education in the west is currently floundering and lacking any kind of coherent approach, and I personally am not against the possibility that the only solution is to tear it all down and start again – but to suggest that the answer lies in a particular medium without any idea of what the message might be doesn’t really take us anywhere. It seems very much based on a behaviourist approach which assumes that some form of immediate reward reinforces learning. While there’s evidence this works in the learning of some skills and the memorisation of knowledge, there’s a whole bunch more stuff to education than long division and lists of kings and queens (or presidents). I’m really keen to see games technologies contribute to education, but for that to happen we need to avoid polarisation – the more I read about this issue the more I find it’s split between extremes of opinion like the above; give us ideas for how busy teachers today can benefit their students with this technology, within the constraints of society’s conflicting demands on education, so that we have more than a handful of gifted enthusiasts with projects that most schools simply can’t aspire to.<query> what is the role of games in education</query> Huggs :O) Marshal #8 Michael J on 10.27.09 at 12:15 pm Brilliant!

We are massive consumers of education. We start in formal education as toddlers and emerge in our 20s. Often none the wiser. And we learn far more out of school than we do in school. Then we have vocational training, usually continuously in our fast changing world. Plus our hobbies and interests that can often involve absorbing more knowledge than a degree course. Which all means that education is a massive industry. Far bigger than the recreational game industry is going to be for the foreseeable future. Which is very nice for us because gaming is perfectly suited to education. Far more so than the current classroom/teacher system. Our one on one, challenge-reward mechanism is the most perfect way yet of imparting knowledge.<query> what is the difference between education and gaming</query> I have watched our industry try to get into education for thirty years. And failing, continually. Because we try to do learning using games. We try and fit in with the old, inefficient teacher led systems. But we have had successes when we don’t try to fit in. Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training, for instance. And these successes come when there isn’t a teacher in sight, because they are true game based learning. And teachers and true game based education are incompatible. You cannot have them both at the same time. Teachers, at best, think that games are chocolate coated broccoli. A way of dressing up knowledge to make it palatable. They are wrong. Gaming is the optimum delivery system for giving the human mind knowledge. Because it is one on one interactive, because it creates exactly the right challenges at exactly the right time, because it can readily mix text with sound with pictures with videos, because it rewards the student properly at exactly the right time, because it is connected to the sum of all human knowledge, because it is non linear thus presenting knowledge in a more natural way, because it progresses the student at exactly the right pace and because it is connected to countless other people.<query> why is gaming an optimum delivery system</query> With proper game based learning it is very simple to keep a track of every student’s progress. But more than that it is very easy to see their strengths and weaknesses in all their complexity. The aptitudes of every single student will be plain to see. Which would lead to everyone having the optimum further education and making the right career choices for their abilities. Which would be a massive improvement on the current hit and miss methodology. So students wouldn’t just learn more, with better understanding and more quickly. They would also be learning the right things for them and for their life ahead. It isn’t just goodbye to classrooms and teachers. It is also goodbye to exams and school inspectors. Because any student’s knowledge and capabilities would be there to see in real time on the system. In fact exams are a very bad thing as they hold the majority of students back until everyone has mastered the syllabus to a given point.<query> why is game based learning important</query> With game based learning you are going to have a lot of people educated past degree level by the time they are 18. But the people who stand to gain most are those with “learning difficulties” who just cannot get all the attention they need with current learning methods. With game based learning they will have one on one learning that will push their aptitudes and capabilities to the limit resulting in much more fulfilling lives. So what are we going to do with all the teachers? Teach them to stack shelves in Tescos? Nope, there is something far more important for them to do and that is to prepare children for their futures in the real world. Not by teaching, but by mentoring. By guiding every single student, one on one, so each one can get the best out of our society and our society can get the best out of each student.<query> what is game based learning</query> Some educationalists who have a grasp of this seem to think that you still need a physical school. That each student has their own workstation. They call it “podularisation”. And they are wrong. All a student needs is a device connected to the interweb. A home computer,a netbook or even a smartphone . Yes, that’s right, smartphones replacing teachers. AndOnLive technology, or something similar, could be harnessed beautifully to deliver it all. The next thing that is going to shock is that much education will end up being free. Once it is all written and on a server the incremental cost for each extra student is zero. And as we have seen with so many things on the interweb there is an inevitable constant downwards price pressure till zero is reached. This will open up and democratise learning like never before.<query> what is the next step in education</query> It will be more influential than the invention of the printing press. Anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to consume whatever education they want any time they want, delivered to them in the optimum manner for them to absorb. This will massively advance the whole of humanity. I would like to thank Nolan Bushnell and all the other speakers at the Game Based Learning 2009 conference for stimulating my thoughts on this subject.

With this simple but explosive beginning, one of America’s most well respected professors of education looks seriously at the good that can come from playing video games. Gee is interested in the cognitive development that can occur when someone is trying to escape a maze, find a hidden treasure and, even, blasting away an enemy with a high powered rifle. Talking about his own video gaming experience learning and using games as diverse as Lara Croft and Arcanum, Gee looks at major specific cognitive activities: How individuals develop a sense of identity How one grasps meaning How one evaluates and follows a command How one picks a role model How one perceives the world This is a ground breaking book that takes up a new electronic method of education and shows the positive upside it has for learning.<query> who is paul gee</query> #2 Judy Valentine on 03.30.09 at 5:02 pm I’m not sure its the end of collective learning.

I have been studying games and learning and have found that most games, especially serious games have no valid or reliable system of measuring learning or transfer. Also, it seems fairly simplistic to assume that all kids like games, as I have found they do not; and more to the point, that all kids will like the same game.<query> what is the project called that uses mobile technology to teach</query>"

clueweb12-1805wb-56-19245,92,2,"And again, one season may call for a slight modification of the work done the previous year. Thus you can easily see that it is impossible for anyone to lay down a fixed set of rules and follow them, in reference to each particular case. All well regulated cemeteries should have their own nursery so you could plant just whenever you have a favorable day. I have planted trees from our own nursery row as late as the third week in May, out in full leaf and without a single loss. This, of course, would be impossible if you had to buy your trees at some distance from home; hence the double advantage. It is common to note how little attention most people pay to the trees after they are once planted. Is it any wonder one sees so few really beautiful specimens? This is apparently due to the fact that they do not require his constant care, and usually seem to thrive without his aid; yet what a vast difference between a well trained, properly cared for tree and the one that has to take care of itself.<query> when to plant trees in a cemetery</query> Perhaps you have noticed in the early spring that a tree of a certain kind may come into flower earlier than another tree of the same variety. That which comes into flower earlier is the male, to be ready for its mate. In all of these elemental facts the tree is just as much alive as man himself and it presents an exceedingly interesting thing for one who is willing to think, to observe, to learn. I wish that it might be possible for people generally to see more into the great world of living things all about us. So often it happens that people go through the world and see almost nothing of the world in which they live. I think perhaps the most beautiful tribute to a tree that I ever heard was told by the President of the Elyria Ohio Rotary Club when I went down there several years ago to give this little talk on trees.<query> what is the meaning of tree</query> In introducing me he related this experience from his own life. He said, ""I have the most wonderful tree in the world at my house. Some fifteen years ago I had a little boy who was then three years of age. In the early fall he would go out to gather up the buckeyes, sometimes by pockets full and sometimes by baskets full, and bring them in and play with them. One day he took sick; the next day he was better. He went out as usual. This time he brought in just one large fine buckeye and played with it, and the next day he died. ""I took that large fine buckeye and carried it with me all the long winter. I would take it out every little while and look at it and was reminded of him. Then, when the spring came, I went out and planted it down under his sand pile.<query> when did buckeyes die</query> Later the sand pile was taken away, the buckeye sprouted and came up a healthy little plant. I built a fence around it and told the boys of the neighborhood that they might break anything, anything I had, the windows of my house or anything but please not to break this tree. They have respected my request and it stands there today, fifteen years old, the most wonderful tree in the world."" I thought as I listened to that story, that there was in this little tree not alone a monument to a little boy who died, but also a monument to a father's love. I wish that it might be possible for people to see something more in trees than just an accident, because as a matter of fact God Almighty put the trees here to help adorn the world. I have sometimes wondered what this world would be if we could remove from it all of the really fine things, if we could remove music, literature, art and religion and the beauty of the great outdoors—that great unmatched beauty of the world of living things.<query> why are trees important to the world</query> I have wondered what this world of ours would be. Have you ever thought of the immense importance of foliage? To the beauty of the world; to its livableness? Just remember, after the leaves have gone, this fall, when there is no blanket of white snow to cover the earth—then again in the early spring when the snow has gone, or is dirty. Look out across the landscape and see how ugly and barren it is. Then notice as the leaves come out and the grass comes forth, what a wonderful change there is with this color of green, this blanket of green that God put here to cover up the ugliness of a naked world. That is why it seems to me that we are likely to under estimate or perhaps neglect to think about the importance of trees to the world way beyond the question of their practical utility.<query> why are trees important</query> It seems to me that God must have known his business when he caused trees to grow upon this earth. You know there is one thing that does arouse me tremendously and that is to see the terrible butchery of trees. Almost everywhere I go I see this slaughter, very largely by the telephone and electric light companies—sometimes by, well, I will call them ""tree-quacks"", sometimes by well-meaning but ignorant tree owners who permit it. God intended that the tops should be on the trees. I am not saying that there is never a time when trees should not be cut back because sometimes it is necessary, if it is done right, but as a general proposition I think it is the most inexcusable thing that any man can be guilty of, to slaughter the trees as they grow. This is what happens: you cut the top of a tree off and you immediately destroy its circulation, and then naturally in her desperation she forces out the latent buds along the side of the stump, and presently you have a new and rather vigorous growth of new shoots, and that is what deceives a lot or people.<query> why do trees need to be cut back</query> They overlook the fact that the stump sticking up there is a constant invitation to disease. Science has demonstrated diseases in trees as it has in other forms of life. In trees it is called fungi, a parasite by nature; it lives by tearing down some other form of life. Now, wherever you see a decaying tree there is disease working and in a certain time of the year it throws out to the surface of the bark what they call fruiting bodies. You have seen them on the outside of trees; they look more or less like toadstools. Those fruiting bodies give off a myriad of microscopic spores that float through the air and most of them fall to the ground harmless, but some of those spores find lodgment in an open wound. It doesn't make any difference what causes the wound, it may be lightening or it may be a lawnmower in the hands of some careless man, anything that breaks the bark causes a wound and in to that wound some of these spores find their way and they start to grow, to send out their little threadlike tentacles, very much like cancer, and they travel up and down from one cell to another, eating, or consuming the cells.<query> what is the disease in trees called</query> That is what they live on, and finally you have internal decay. What we call decay is merely the result of this active disease that is working on the inside. You cannot have anything worse than a horizontal wound in a tree. You look at that wound under a microscope and it is very much like a sponge because the cells are hollow and you cut right across them and there you have your sponge-like effect, a constant invitation for the spores of the fungi to find lodgment there and start to grow and just as sure as the sun rises and sets there will be a decay because there is no life in that stump, there cannot be any life without leaves, so, down to the point where the new growth starts the decay proceeds and goes constantly on and on into the wood of the tree and after a while you have nothing but a mere shell, and so this thing that deceives people, this vigorous new growth in the little branches that are forced out from the latent buds is a screen to hide the ravages of disease in the wound.<query> what is the result of decay</query> But even if it didn't cause the destruction of the trees through disease and decay I cannot imagine why anybody can see beauty in a tree that is beheaded. I wonder sometimes what has become of men's sense of beauty. I heard a story from a member of Congress that interested me very much. I want to tell it to you now because I think it is more or less apropos to this band of tree butchers that we find in America. I had related in one of my talks in the House this little story about the buckeye tree, and after I sat down a member of the House from Florida came over and sat down beside me and told me that he wanted to relate an experience that he had the preceding summer. Now this gentleman was an old, white haired man, one of the most portly gentlemen that I have ever met, a man perhaps in the late sixties with wonderful poise and self control.<query> why was the buckeye tree beheaded</query> I have never seen him excited, and I have never seen him over enthuse. He related his little story somewhat like this, he said: ""When I was young and our first and only son was born my mother proposed that we plant a magnolia tree in the front yard in his honor. Being young and more or less irresponsible I laughed at the idea, but she persisted, so we planted a magnolia tree. ""The first time it bloomed was when he was graduated from high school; the next time it bloomed was when his sister was graduated. Then several years passed. The boy went away to war. In the war he contracted an incurable disease. He came back and lingered for a while, and finally passed away. ""Last summer they were going to widen the street in front of my house, and probably cut down that magnolia tree, so I went to see the city engineer.<query> when did the magnolia tree bloom</query> I said to him, Sir, I understand that you are going to widen the street in front of my house. He said, 'yes, that is the plan.' I said, 'Sir, I understand you plan to cut down the magnolia tree in my front yard.' He said, 'Well I am afraid we will have to.' ' Well, Sir, I came to tell you I shall shoot the man who cuts that tree.' He said, 'Do you mean it?' I said, 'Sir, I mean it. ' The man who cuts that tree I shall shoot and kill him.' ' Well,' he said, 'it won't be cut. "" Sometimes I think that is about the kind of treatment that is necessary to stop this unending slaughter of America's trees.<query> who cut down the magnolia tree</query> A tree demands very little care and attention if it be done annually, but that it must have to develop properly. How to save our trees? That is the problem; to prevent them from dying; to keep them in good health, strong and beautiful; to keep them with us. Surely these are admirable endeavors and worthy of much thought and attention. I cannot emphasize enough the necessity of removing the old bark of the trees once every two years just before spring opens. This should be gathered carefully and burned. It is not only of the greatest benefit to the growth and appearance of the tree, but it also destroys thousands of insects, larva and pupa in them, which have their winter quarters under the loose pieces of bark, just getting ready for their destructive work as soon as spring opens.<query> how often should you cut down trees</query> I see it everywhere I go, tens of thousands of them absolutely slaughtered and ruined. So far as telephone and electric light men are concerned I will make the statement that not more than 15% or 20% of the cutting is necessary that is usually done to get all of the wire clearance that is reasonably necessary for those wires to go through. I know because we have done a reasonable amount of it and have secured clearance, ample clearance with only a moderate amount of cutting. We cleared the trees in my home town for the telephone company there and didn't cut a single limb bigger than your thumb and gave them ample clearance. I think it is the most damnable slaughter, the most useless sacrifice of beauty that I know of in America, and sometimes I think the only kind of treatment that will answer is the kind of treatment that the tree butchers mete out to trees.<query> how much cutting is necessary for a telephone</query> That may sound a little harsh and yet I want to say, gentlemen that these men who slaughter the trees of America in this way defy all the laws of our country and all the laws of decency. They know no law and no restraint, only the law of force. I had an experience down in my home town—the telephone company was proposing to stretch a new line along the main street where I live and it is a beautiful street—I didn't make it so—the main street, where I live, the foresight of men fifty or seventy-five years ago made my street beautiful, and I was afraid of what would happen, so I called up the manager of the telephone company and asked him what their program was. He said, ""Well, we will have to put the wires through."" I said, '''Does that mean cutting?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""No more than is necessary."" Well, I said, ""Now listen, don't you cut any of those trees on the street where I live."" He said, ""what do you mean'?"" I said, ""I want to be perfectly frank with you, I have got a gun in the house, and the first fellow who undertakes to cut those trees I am going to use the gun on him, I know how to use it and it is in first class condition."" He said, ""What<query> do you cut trees</query> do you mean?"" I said, ""I mean business."" Well, as a matter of fact the trees weren't cut. I know of a case down in Poland, Ohio where one determined man in that community by his own force kept the electric light company from despoiling the trees that were a century old and were the pride and the glory of that community, the trees that made the town worth living in. It seems to me that what we need is just a little more of the fighting spirit out of which America was born in order to protect the rights of the public. Speaking along that line makes me think of the story about the minister who was lecturing his congregation on the subject of heaven and hell—an old fashioned subject. They used to talk a good deal about it, some of our modern ministers lecture on sociology, and books and theatres, and so forth, it used to be that they talked about heaven and hell.<query> why was the fighting spirit of america born</query> Anyway this must have been an old fashioned sort of minister because he proceeded at some length to plead with his congregation about this subject of great importance. Finally after he had finished he said to them, ""Any of you who want to go to heaven, stand up."" They all stood up except one old fellow who was asleep. They sat down and he said, ""Any of you who want to go to hell, stand up."" The old fellow woke up just in time to hear the last part of it and he stood up and looked the minister straight in the eye. The minister looked at him and said, ""My good man do you know what you are standing up for?"" He said, ""I do not, but you and I seem to be the only ones for it."" Now, with your permission I would like to talk for just a little while about another subject which seems to me of great and far-reaching importance and that is the question of forest devastation.<query> who said stand up for me</query> I am interested in it tremendously because it seems to me that this question of forest is one of the things that project themselves farther into the future of our country than most of the things that we ordinarily concern ourselves with. I call you to witness that we have lived through every tariff law that was ever enacted whether it be a high tariff, or a low tariff, and we have lived through every tax bill, high or low, somehow we have lived through it, and we have lived through a lot of other laws, good and bad, but there are some things that no nation can live through and remain great and strong and one of those is the destruction of the great natural wealth that only God can make. I have reference particularly to the destruction of America's forest wealth. A hundred and fifty years ago America became a new nation and this land was endowed by the creator with a greater quantity probably of natural wealth than any nation in the history of the world, and we started in with a prodigal hand to spend it as fast as we could go.<query> what is the destruction of the forest</query> Those of our forefathers who landed in Virginia under Captain John Smith sent back word to the mother country that they had discovered a land of inexhaustible fertility, and so it seemed, but you can go into Virginia today and buy thousands of acres almost for a song because it has been robbed of its fertility, it lacks the power of producing things in sufficient quantity to pay for cultivation. As a matter of fact I see an increasing number of abandoned farms from the Atlantic Seaboard west. In my own county there are 400 abandoned farms and this section was settled less than 200 years ago. Those of our forefathers who landed on the coast of New England carne face to face with a wonderful covering of trees, trees everywhere and yet today the New England states have exhausted four fifths of their original lumber supply; half of their remaining supply is in the State of Maine that is largely pulp wood varieties.<query> where are abandoned farms</query> They already import 30% of their own consumption and will import more and more as time goes on. Even the great Empire State of New York that once was the greatest producer of lumber in the Union today produces only 10% of its own consumption. They produce 30 board feet per capita every year and use 300. Penn's Woods, Pennsylvania, named because of its wonderful covering of trees has so far exhausted its supply of timber that they produced today less than enough for the Pittsburgh district alone, about 20% of their own consumption. The great lake states where there was a wonderful supply of magnificent white pine—that is almost gone. The original supply was estimated to have been 350 billion board feet, and it is now reduced to 8 billion, and it will be all gone in perhaps ten or fifteen years.<query> what is the largest producer of lumber in the united states</query> The wonderful supply of yellow pine in the south Atlantic and Gulf States is four-fifths gone. So I might go on and tell you the story, step by step, but the last report of the United States Forest Service tells us that the entire eastern half of the United States will be stripped bare of its timber from a commercial standpoint within twenty-five years. Of course there will be many individual trees, but speaking commercially the eastern half of the United States faces a lumber shortage, or exhaustion. And also that same report says that the apparently inexhaustible supply in the far west will be all gone in thirty-five or forty years, according to the present rate of consumption because as each section is stripped of its timber it lays a heavier and heavier demand on the remaining sections. One of the men with our company—that is the Davey Tree Expert Company (incidentally I have to stay in business to make the money I spend in politics) one of the men with our company was working in Mississippi last winter.<query> when will the eastern half of the us be stripped of timber</query> He knew I was interested in this subject of conservation and he wrote to me about the conditions he found in the little town down there. He said the town had been built around the lumber industry and the whole supply was exhausted so the company had been bringing logs from the Pacific Coast by way of the Panama Canal, up through the Gulf of Mexico by rail so this little town in Mississippi could keep alive. That is not an isolated case; there are many many communities that have almost ceased to exist because of the exhaustion of the lumber supply. I was told last summer by a representative of the United States Forest Service that one-fifth of the timberland in the state of Michigan had gone back to the state for nonpayment of taxes. It is land good for nothing else except growing trees and the trees have been so entirely cut away, the land has no more value, and nobody wants it, so they dumped it back on the state for the rest of the people to carry the load.<query> why did the lumber industry stop</query> However, the question of lumber supply is only one phase of this far-reaching proposition. I sometimes wonder how we would carry on in our scheme of civilization if we ran out of lumber. Stop to think of all the things into which lumber enters and ask yourselves how we would maintain our scheme of civilization, our standard of living and progress, without lumber, and you have some idea of the magnitude of the problem. But that isn't all. I have in mind the terrible tragedy that we were reading about so much in the papers this Last spring when the flood waters were sweeping down through the Mississippi Valley. I am thoroughly convinced that the more serious aspects of that flood were due to the destruction of the trees around the headwaters of the streams that makeup the Mississippi. It wasn't the water that fell down into the Mississippi Valley, it was the water that fell in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Indiana and Kentucky and Illinois, Wisconsin, Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa—all that great section where the trees have been cut away and the water sweeps quickly into the little streams and it pours rapidly into the larger streams and finally into the Father of Waters.<query> why did the mississippi flood happen</query> ""One ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure"" and the removal of the old bark is just such an ounce of prevention against the ravages of caterpillars and scale in summer. PRUNING I was taught some years ago by our local nurserymen, to do all tree pruning when the trees were dormant, or when the sap was down; but from my own experience, and observation of late years, I do all my pruning when the sap is up and I recommend same to all my friends. In our own locality, the center of Ohio, I find the month of June and usually the first two weeks of July (if the weather conditions are right) is the best season of year to do this work. One should always use a sharp, fine-tooth saw, and as soon as the trees are pruned paint the cuts with one coat of thin paint.<query> when to prune trees in ohio</query> And so the channel was just too small, it couldn't hold it, and we had a flood, and we will have more and more floods as the destruction continues because nature made the trees, the forest trees as a reservoir to hold the water back and let it seep out gradually. Go out sometime into the woods and see the condition that the creator made. Look down at the wonderful soil, loose, porous, soil it is and take up a handful of it and see the provision that was made to absorb the moisture and then watch the water in imagination as it comes down from the heavens through the leaves and settles into this loose porous soil and follow it further, in imagination as it travels by underground channels to the little springs, and see how those springs feed the little streams, and they in turn feed the rivers, and thus you have a continuity of water supply.<query> why did nature make the trees</query> But when man comes along in his breathless haste to get rich quick, or for some other reason and he cuts the trees away, allows the land to be burned over. When the rain descends from the heavens it sweeps across the surface of the land and takes with it the precious topsoil, precious top soil. It is said by scientists that it takes nature ten thousand years to make one inch of fertile top soil by the process of decaying vegetation, piling one little particle upon another—ten thousand years, and oh so little time to wash it away. I stood by the Potomac River in Washington some two or three years ago when that stream was on the rampage and like all flood waters that stream was also muddy, and I thought to myself: what part of my country is making this terrible contribution to the sea?<query> how long does it take for topsoil to form</query> And then after the flood waters had subsided I went into Potomac Park again and there on the grass I saw an inch or two of precious top soil deposited there by the mad rushing waters, but only a little fraction of the enormous quantity that had been carried down to the ocean. Reading in one of the News Weekly Magazines this last spring about the flood in the Mississippi I came across one paragraph that struck me with great force. It told how fishermen were coming back from the Gulf of Mexico and describing the condition of the water. It said that the Gulf Stream was actually becoming discolored by the prodigious quantity of soil carried down by this flood. It also told how great schools of fishes were coming far out into the Gulf in order to escape suffocation. This question of the washing away of the precious topsoil it seems to me is one of the very serious aspects of our forest devastation policy, but that is only one side of it.<query> what was the effect of the gulf stream flood</query> There is also the question of adequate water supply. Our capital city, Columbus, Ohio several years ago was face to face with a water famine, the situation was so bad that they held prayer meetings calling upon God Almighty to save them from the threatened catastrophe—that is our human system, we do everything wrong then when we get into trouble we call upon God to pull us out of the hole. Anyway they had their prayer meetings and whether God answered their prayers we don't know, but a providential rain did come and averted this terrible catastrophe. Can you imagine anything more serious than a city of 300,000 people without water? Columbus secures its municipal supply from the Sciota River and that stream is all but dried up all because the trees and the vegetation had been cut away from its head waters, and so sometimes you have too much water and that causes a flood and then you have too little water at other times, and that causes a drought.<query> why is columbus ohio without water</query> That is a part of the penalty that man must pay for his folly and for his destruction. There is another aspect to it that is both interesting and important. Scientists tell us that one tree in an average growing season throws into the air about five hundred barrels of water through its leaves by the process called transpiration. Just as our breath is laden with moisture so there is thrown out through the leaves great quantities of moisture in vapor form to remain in the air to be condensed and come back as rainfall. Then it is taken up again by vegetation and again it is thrown out in vapor form to be condensed once more and thrown out as rainfall. So you have the constant supply of water for all forms of life. . You probably have heard the old saying about the sun drawing water, referring to evaporation.<query> how much water is thrown out of trees</query> Science tells us there is infinitely more water thrown into the air through the leaves of vegetation than from all the evaporation and all the rivers and lakes in the ocean. It is a constant supply of moisture into the air by the process of transpiration through the leaves. Speaking about conservation—I heard a story about a Scotchman that may interest you. I have a suspicion that maybe there are some Scotchmen here. Well, you know they have a reputation for being rather thrifty. I don't know whether it is true or not. Anyway this particular Scotchman was sitting in a hotel lobby feeling pretty blue and looking as though he were beyond the power of consolation. A stranger came by and asked him what the trouble was and Sandy said, ""I am on my Honeymoon and I couldn’t afford to bring my wife."" Now I want to refer, in closing, to two other things, first to the tragic example of China because we have in the example of China ample evidence of' what may happen to America and a proper indication of what we ought to do.<query> why is it important to conserve water</query> China once had a wonderful covering of trees, very much like our own, perhaps not as fine and still a very wonderful covering and China did with her trees just exactly as we are doing with ours. She cut them away, allowed her land to be burned over and then the floods came and swept away her precious topsoil. China has become a land of perpetual famine. They only have one crop in seven years. In the other years of that period they must look to the world for food. One of my brothers took a trip around the world some three or four years ago and he was interested in the subject just the same as I and when he returned he told me of his observations. He described how when they came up through the Yellow Sea he was impressed by the increasing chocolate color of the water and he wondered what its significance was.<query> why is china a land of perpetual famine</query> Then when they went out across the land and saw those miles and miles of barren land, he began to understand. He told me that he saw men and women and children out gathering weed stalks by the roadside with which to cook their rice, they had no wood for fuel, not even bushes, just weeds. There are millions of acres of land in China where nothing grows at all, not even weeds, then there are other millions and millions of acres where nothing much more than weeds can grow, and so they have a land stripped of its fertility in large part with an enormous population, and I am afraid that the case of China is hopeless. I wish that my country might profit by that example because no land in the history of the world ever survived the destruction of its great natural wealth.<query> where does weed grow in china</query> That land where Christ was born today supports only 10% of the population that it did 1900 years ago, because the land has been robbed of its fertility and fewer and fewer people can live there. Meanwhile the population of the world is increasing. This question of preserving the fertility of the soil so that it may grow food for man and animals and all forms of life I think is one of the great problems of this and future generations. I am interested in this question because it affects my country. Possibly you and I may not see the severe consequences of our national folly, we may be dead and gone before its worst phases appear, but even so we have a very great responsibility for the safekeeping of this great heritage. Our America—we sing of it in song, we glorify it in our literature, but what is America?<query> why is the soil important to the survival of life</query> Is it land? Is it rivers and lakes or mountains? No. That isn't America, because this land was here many years ago and the same mighty rivers were flowing to the sea, long before civilization began and the same majestic mountains lifted their lofty summits to the skies before man was, and even the same stars twinkled in the nighttime before there was any life upon this globe. No—America is a great human thing, a great new system, and philosophy of government. America is people and those things which affect people are the things of supreme and lasting importance. Nothing is of greater significance than the destruction of the basic wealth upon which people exist. I am tempted to relate to you the little story of my good old father, because it was from him that I received my first inspiration in the cause of conservation, from his lips years ago I heard the story.<query> what is the difference between america and the world</query> Never leave any stubs when pruning, but cut always just as close as possible to the trunk of the tree, so that the cambium gets a chance to close the wound, and the sap must be up in the tree in order to promote this growth. Cambium is the white and softer part of wood between the inner bark and the wood. It is popularly called the sap-wood. This is annually acquiring firmness and thus becoming hard wood. If a limb is cut when the sap is down, and has to stand several months, before the sap rises up again this cut becomes hard and dry, and in most cases the cambium never starts to grow and in a few years the cut is rotten and makes a home for insects and we all know that where we have insects we cannot have a healthy tree.<query> what is the cambium</query> He was born in, England at a time when there were no public schools, and he was twenty-one before he knew his ABC’s. That is almost inconceivable to us in this country where education is free, but it was the general rule then in England because only the children of the aristocracy had the advantages of education. So he started in as a full grown young man to learn to read by the slow painful process of self-education. He began with a little copy of the New Testament and a little dictionary, picking out one word at a time until he finally acquired a grammar so that he might learn to put the words together properly. He showed me one time not very long before he passed away the old faded copy of the New Testament from which he learned to read and on it there was a brown spot where a drop of milk had fallen as he studied while he milked in the long ago.<query> when was edgar robertson born</query> Then, like millions of other sturdy sons of Europe he heard the call of America, this great land of freedom and opportunity, and he came here to work out his destiny. He pursued his education still further studying by night and working by day until he finally acquired an education that would have done credit to the average college graduate, and I sometimes think a more profound education. But one of the things that impressed me most about him was the fad that he became one of the really fine Americans that it has been my privilege to know. He learned every word of our Constitution, every word of it. He learned every word of every verse of America and every word of the Star Spangled Banner, and until old age laid its heavy hand upon him he could sing those songs with a zeal and a fervor that were good to see.<query> what was the most important thing that john f. kennedy learned about He became a full citizen under our law at the first opportunity, and he told me of that sacred day when he raised his right hand and foreswore allegiance to the British Crown and swore allegiance to the flag of America, and his eyes filled with tears as he described that most sacred day of his life. I saw him from the time I was a little fellow, and long before I could comprehend the significance of it, every time he passed by Old Glory he tipped his hat in veneration. I think perhaps there is something in that story for you and for me, for those of us who were born here, those of us who were privileged to come here by choice to make this a home because this great wonderful America, this new nation is a rich heritage, America is only a hundred and fifty years old, that is only two normal life times.<query> who tipped his hat in veneration</query> It seems quite a while to talk about a hundred and fifty years, but just a little while ago we were reading about King Tut who reigned in Egypt thirty-five hundred years ago, and as we look back across the long span of time we begin to realize how very young America is, because in that period of thirty-five hundred years we can see countless nations rise and fall, kingdoms and principalities and powers almost without number come and go and then we realize how very young America is and when we take an inventory of our situation we realize how far we have gone on the road of destruction. We have spent the principal of our inheritance faster than any people that ever lived, and some day we shall pay a tragic price. America is ours only for safekeeping, we do not own it.<query> how long has america been in power</query> Oh I know the land stands in our names at the court houses, if we own it, but we only have it so long as we may live, and then according to the laws of nature we must pass it on to other generations that are yet to come. This country, great and wonderful as it .is came into our keeping as stewards to use and to enjoy for a little while, and then we must pass it on and when we received our America with all of its matchless and manifold blessings we received also a great and everlasting responsibility to keep our America as great and as wonderful and as worthwhile as it was when we received it.

The sunlight and air should reach every part of the tree. Do not prune simply because you see your neighbor pruning, but start about your work with the aim of accomplishing a certain fixed purpose, and never cut a branch from your tree unless you have a reason for so doing. The tree may be spread, or it may be contracted, by cutting to a bud that point outward for the former or to a bud that inclines inward for the later. If this be done intelligently it will prove of great value in the training of your trees. As a rule, the weaker the growth the harder it should be pruned back.<query> when to prune a tree</query> This will encourage a heavier wood growth the following season. By this article it can be seen that growing fine trees is not a sinecure, but still it is a glorious work, demanding a man's whole energy and unfailing love for Nature, and one of her most beautiful creations--the tree.

C. Simonds Graceland Cemetery, Chicago, IIlinois Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 39th Annual Convention Of all the characteristics of a cemetery, which is the most desirable? A cemetery should first of all be comforting. This means that it must be beautiful, restful, secluded. To attain these characteristics it must include within its boundary much of nature. What is nature? In its broadest significance it includes almost the universe. Some persons use this term as if it were synonymous with the Deity, saying, Nature does this, nature does that, nature's laws are the laws of God.<query> what is the characteristic of a cemetery</query> Although we sometimes speak of inanimate nature, it is often personified. Often we hear the expression ""Mother Earth"", perhaps less frequently nature is referred to as ""mother"". Mother most endearing of all words. The poet says: “Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind."" She is represented as soothing and comforting and especially as healing the mind, the part that is in greatest need of healing when a dear friend is left to the permanent care of a cemetery. Nature, therefore, is the most important feature to have in mind in designing a cemetery. For the purpose of this paper, nature will be considered as that manifestation of the out of doors that is independent of man. We find it in its most attractive and familiar shape in the woods, the borders of lakes and rivers, the hills and valleys, ravines and sky and in the clouds.<query> what is nature's meaning</query> Nature has infinite variety. When we detect the work of man, as in an orchard, a field of corn; or a row of trees along an avenue, we cease to think of what we see as the work of nature, out rather look at it as man's creation. We see nature when we look at the wooded margin of an open field with its skyline of oaks, its thicket of wild crab apples blooming in the full sun, its viburnums and elderberries. We see her along the rights of way of railroads as we journey from one place to another. In spring or early summer, when we look from a car window, we are greeted with large beds of iris, lupines, shooting stars, spiderworts, butterfly weeds, black-eyed susans, ferns, or a little later, with the flowers or Joe Pye Wood, wild roses, lilies, cardinal flowers, goldenrod, asters and hundreds of others of nature's planting.<query> what is nature's work</query> If the train passes through woods, we may see here and there, as we look from the car window, masses of sassafras, filled with yellow flowers in spring, rich with foliage throughout the summer and gloriously colored with yellows and reds in autumn. We may also see oaks, maples, hawthorns, dogwoods, elderberries, prairie roses, wild grapes clematis, bittersweet and a host of other woody plants all beautiful and all helping to give what we call ""the charm of nature."" What is this charm which we feel when we go to the woods, when we go to pine forests, when we so to uncultivated prairies which glow with wild sunflowers, asters and goldenrod and when we wander along the wooded banks of lakes and rivers and through wooded ravines? It is difficult to analyze and define, hut it is due to nature's perfect freedom, to beauty of outline and color, to deep shadows and bright lights, to many things being hidden by foliage or inequalities of ground, to the air of mystery that pervades things in which man has no hand.<query> what is the charm of nature</query> It is this charm of nature which we should try to introduce into cemeteries. It is this that makes her ""consoling and kind"". Many cemeteries do not have this charm. Often one sees from the train cemeteries fully exposed to view on all sides and containing only monuments, headstones and a few forlorn trees. Even some pretentious cemeteries with very costly monuments and perfectly kept lawns lack this charm which soothes and comforts. Are there any cemeteries in which this comforting characteristic can be found? Mr. Strauch introduced it into Spring Grove Cemetery in the naturalistic /borders of the lakes and in the preservation of the wooded ravines. Recently a cemetery has been established on Long Island which bids fair to contain the charm of which I speak. This cemetery, designed by the Olmsteds, is to have no stonework above the ground.<query> what is the charm of a cemetery</query> A family name may appear on a stone tablet set even with the turf. There is a plentiful supply of shrubbery to separate one lot from another. When nature has had time to correct the inevitable imperfections and rawness of new plantings, this may become one of her most charming retreats. Many cemeteries contain touches of the charm of nature, but I know of none really perfect. It is true that people's tastes differ and we have different points of view. One telephone man said that to his eye a line of straight telephone poles on each side of a road with arms carrying a plentiful supply of wires was the most beautiful decoration a thoroughfare could have, but I think even he would have hesitated about putting such a decoration in a cemetery. These opinions, however, are evidently somewhat biased. A lover of nature has nothing to sell, no ax to grind.<query> what is the most beautiful decoration in a cemetery</query> He is merely anxious to have people enjoy with him the beauty that he sees. The appreciation of this beauty is something that must be cultivated in order to be fully enjoyed. Some do not even see a sunset until their attention is called to it. Some see no beauty in winter, while others experience great enjoyment at that season in the branching of trees, the twiggery of shrubs, the snow and the glistening ice-covered branches. There are two or three things which seem desirable in order to secure that beauty of nature which is so comforting. The first is to reduce the amount of stonework either by planting out most of the monuments and headstones, or by reducing them to inconspicuous dimensions. Some of the money that is spent for monuments should be spent in securing more land so that there will be room for shrubs and flowers.<query> what is the best way to preserve the beauty of nature</query> We should appreciate the fact that while a perfect lawn is most desirable in some places, there are other places where the ground cover should include other things. Where height is not objectionable, lilacs will often spread out and make a beautiful ground cover when left undisturbed. The same is true of many other shrubs. Where land is poor and sandy perhaps nothing in the shrub line is better for a ground cover than the aromatic sumach, which is beautiful at all seasons, and especially attractive in the fall with its rich coloring. For a still low covering, there are many vines that are suitable. In the deep Shade of woods the Virginia creeper often makes a beautiful cover, hiding the entire ground with a layer of leaves of a delightful green in summer and often richly colored in autumn. Wild violets, myrtle, Japanese spurge, moneywort, ground ivy and carpet bugle are a few of the many beautiful ground covering plants.<query> what plants are good ground coverings</query> In a neglected country cemetery a large area became covered with cypress spurge. This is a beautiful little Euphorbia and while it is often called a weed, it was the most attractive thing in the cemetery being green arid fresh-looking while the grass everywhere else was brown. The neighboring farmer called it cemetery grass and the first question he asked was how to get rid of it. Often, too many so-called bedding plants are used in a cemetery. These bring in revenue and are showy in summer, but they leave the ground bare from October until May. To bring in the charm of nature we should use more hardy perennials. These often beautify waste places in a most satisfactory way. They are on hand from early in the spring until snow comes and even their dead stems and seed vessels are often graceful and beautiful throughout the winter.<query> what plants are used in a cemetery</query> Many city dwellers are in the habit of going to northern Wisconsin or northern Michigan for rest and recreation during the summer. Some of these have asked ""Why can't I have my cemetery lot like the northern woods which I love 80 much?"" These persons certainly feel the charm of nature and would like to have this charm about their final resting place. The longer we live and the more we observe, the more shall we be convinced of the truth of that oft-repeated saying, ""Nature is the best teacher"". The superintendent who can introduce foliage and flowers as nature uses them everywhere in covering waste places, creating forests, developing secluded beauty spots and doing all this while concealing his own part in the work will be the most successful in the development of a really worthy cemetery. In a cemetery well endowed with the charms of nature, one cannot see from end to end and from side to side and on beyond to surrounding buildings or farms.<query> why can't i have my cemetery lot like the northern woods</query> From every point there will be views, some wide, some narrow, and these will be bounded at the sides and terminated by foliage. The side boundaries will not be straight but will recede here and there into bays, tempting one on to see into their depths. Against the foliage will be seen, from time to time, quantities of flowers, wild crab apple blossoms, lilacs, flowers of hawthorn, forsythia and a hundred others. Here and there at the base of the foliage there may at times be the blossoms of iris, peonies, goldenrod, coreopsis and other flowers too numerous to mention or if it is in the fall, there will be attractive fruits, foliage and the blossoms of witch hazel. If there is a hill or ridge, it will be masked at the top with the foliage of trees reaching from the ground to the skyline so that one can easily imagine in looking at the upward slope that it extends on indefinitely to a great height.<query> what is the foliage of a tree</query> If there is a valley, the views into its depths will be preserved. There will be extended openings showing at the bottom a green turf or the foliage of low growing plants like moneywort, myrtle or partridge berry, or perhaps, there will be a stream or lake or little pools reflecting the sky and forming jewels in the landscape. If there is a good view outside of the cemetery to a distant hill, lake or river, or to a sunset, this view will, of course, be preserved. In such a cemetery the stone monuments will be inconspicuous, but the cemetery as a whole will be a memorial park, a fitting monument for all buried within its enclosure where ""Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind.""

Plumb Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention Mankind is living today in the Air Age.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> We turn the switch of the radio and out of the air comes reports of the days news from cities miles away. Lives are saved by the S. O. S. sent out from ships in distress. Our mails are being carried day and night over a vast net work of airways and the air has become the highway of travel between all countries and all people. We not only breathe the air for the very existence of life itself but in countless other ways are we dependent upon air in this modern age. Nothing is more universally distributed over the earth's surface and it is as free to the scientist as it is to plants and animals. Air is composed of the four common elements: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, but nitrogen is in the greatest abundance. Plants and animals are composed of the same four elements and nitrogen is the plant food required in the largest quantities.<query> why do we breathe air</query> As man's dependence for food is almost entirely on plant growth it is of great importance that our supply of nitrogen be increased to take care of the ever increasing population of the world. It is estimated that the air over every square mile of land contains twenty million tons of nitrogen or thirty thousand tons over every acre. Mother Nature with unusual impartiality has distributed nitrogen to every country in proportion to its area. The problem of the Scientist was how to extract this nitrogen from the air and make it available as a plant food. It was known for ages that lightning fixes or converts some of the nitrogen into a chemical compound which the rain and the snow carries into the ground where the plant roots can absorb it. It was known that clovers and other leguminous crops took some of the nitrogen from the air, but all of these processes are slow and the Scientist struggled for centuries to find the secret of extracting some of this abundant nitrogen from the air so that it could be used for the good of mankind.<query> how much nitrogen is in the air</query> The new concentrates contain no weed seeds or waste material. Their application is easy and pleasant, the labor cost is reduced arid the exact amount necessary for each plants requirements can be supplied and all guesswork eliminated. So literally, ""OUT OF THE AIR"" has come our most necessary plant food. As the population increased the area of fertility must be expanded. The day is coming when one acre must produce as much as two does now. We must adapt ourselves to these new methods and prepare for even greater discoveries which will improve the fertility of our soils.

Moore Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention I chose the subject, ""The Influence of Landscape Gardening on International Relationship"" because landscape gardening is a work in which you are vitally interested and because no phase of human endeavor yields more attractive results nor appeals more to the finer susceptibilities of the human heart.<query> when was the aacs conference</query> The apparent result of the practice is the transformation of unsightly places in all communities of note, into spots upon which the eye delights to rest. Cemeteries today—these sacred spots, the laying out of which it is your duty to superintend—are no longer called places of the dead, places shunned by the public, but have become through your zeal gardens of living beauty—a tribute to the intelligence of man and a sign that civilization is advancing. It should not be assumed that a beautifully laid out and planted cemetery or a beautiful park, are assets only to the community in which located. The influence of beautifully landscaped areas extends far beyond their own environs. The passing tourist notes them; he speaks about them. They thus become an example to be emulated. Many towns and cities are known throughout the length and breadth of North America by reason of their beautiful parks and cemeteries.<query> why are cemeteries important</query> In the hearts of all civilized people is a love for the Beautiful things of the Creation—flowers and trees and shrubs—and so, in life, as if drawn by an invisible magnet, we find ourselves attracted to these places of beauty and in the end we have so ordained that when the soul hath left its tenement our bodies shall repose unforgotten in areas where each succeeding year the opening buds and leaves and flowers proclaim ""There is no Death"". Such, Mr. President and members of the American Association of Cemetery Superintendents, is your work and mission. You build a rampart of living beauty around the places where our dust shall lie and which, as a result, are no longer referred to as ""places of the dead."" You hold this convention in Canada because you are attracted; you are interested in our cemeteries and parks and by the beauty of our home surroundings and landscapes.<query> what is the purpose of the american association of cemetery superintendents</query> Millions of your people visit Canada for the same reason, and I may add, because you like us, and Canada is rapidly becoming the summer playground of North America. Thus the work of man in his efforts to supplement nature in planting to hide the unsightly and to enhance the already beautiful is having a great effect in bringing together our peoples and in strengthening and cementing the bonds of good-will and friendship which for more than a century have been the talk and wonder of the world. You may be surprised to know that in Ontario, of which Toronto is the capital city, there is an organization known as the Ontario Horticultural Association which has a membership of 80,000 and comprises 285 societies. (It is purely amateur and is the largest of its kind. As you drive along the roads and through the municipalities you observe the gardens, the plantings of shrubs, the flowers of all kinds.<query> what is the largest horticultural association in canada</query> To this organization should largely, go the credit for this desirable condition. Our people are influenced by a desire to have beautiful homes and also that the sight of them should give pleasure to visitors from the states. They are interested in them. They desire their friendship rather than their money, and they find that the influence of the beauty they have created coupled with the beauty of park and cemetery and street within our municipalities is doing more to bring about a closer feeling of friendship than any other single factor. Through this attraction the people of the United States and Canada are getting together in a way previously undreamed of and as a result a full and proper understanding will inevitably accrue. It has been claimed that good roads are the attraction. No, not solely. Were these roads to run hundreds of miles through a wilderness, through a desert, they would be deserted except by the adventurer.<query> why are the people of the united states and canada attracted to each other</query> Good roads are but one factor. There are two others—beauty and friendship—and of the latter, the most important, we offer you good measure, pressed down and running over. By reason of this understanding, this closer friendship, your country and mine, two great English speaking nations, have found a common ground upon which can be expressed this great love and regard for each other in a way that will be the admiration and envy of the world. We are going to establish the world's most beautiful peace memorial at a point upon our border—an International Peace Garden. In this great garden, one half in the United States, the other in Canada, the landscape architects craft will find its greatest expression, and the influence of the resultant beauty coupled with its great sentiment, will be such as to draw all peoples—and it will become the world's greatest shrine.<query> where is the peace garden</query> What will the influence of this garden be on international relationships? Within its vast area will be trees and shrubs and flowers from all parts of the earth, Gardens beautifully landscaped to represent the national style of various countries, The governments of both countries will be asked to neutralize the area and to it will come the people of the hundred nations which compose the population of the United States and Canada and people from overseas and from the Latin countries to the south and all will be citizens of this great and beautiful area. Nothing can be so beautiful as a garden, nothing more attractive, and it will belong to the people themselves, and the names of all subscribers will be kept for the eyes of future generations to scan; the adults in one set of volumes, the children in another, for all are to be given an opportunity to subscribe to raise the endowment of five million dollars.<query> what will the influence of this garden be on international relations?</query> Nothing appeals to the human heart more than beauty. This garden will be not merely a beautiful expression of the love of each nation for the other, but a living and enduring one. It will not crumble nor decay like a shaft of granite. The dust of centuries shall not bury it. Each circling spring will see it renewed as a mountain stream is renewed in power and beauty, and a thousand years hence it will, in its majestic grandeur, still be the greatest symbol of international friendship and goodwill. The first International Peace Garden will be the world's strongest fortress, stronger than loop holed battlement or dugout of concrete and steel, for these cannot, stand the brunt of modern warfare. It will be the fortress of friendship built upon the rock of Christianity as expressed through the love of each nation; and in its shadow we may each forever crest secure.<query> what is the international peace garden</query> In friendship alone is there security, is there real happiness. Your act in coming to Canada is an act of friendship. Last year to this city came the National Association of Gardeners. That was an act of friendship. They have the same ideals and aims and are engaged in the same great work. They sponsor the International Peace Garden project. I wonder if you realize how much your lives and work influence the thoughts of the masses toward life's better things. Your work is not a job; it is an influence. The burial of the dead is a job. The beautification of God's acre is an influence. The poet says: ""Tis all a checkerboard of nights and days Where destiny with men for pieces plays, Hither and thither moves and mates and slays And one by one back in the closet lays"".<query> what is the meaning of the poem tis all a checkerboard of nights and But that is not true. The influence of a life is not lost for it pertains to the soul. Your great national organization exerts an influence. It is devoted to the beautification not only of your cemeteries but of your country. You convene today to discuss your problems, to tell each other of the things you have accomplished and of the things projected and so your influence extends more rapidly than otherwise and will continue until it reaches from coast to coast and to result in a blessing to every community. This influence is not only a national influence but an international one. The standards you set in the laying out and maintaining of your cemeteries are emulated by Canada. Your cemetery practices are very advanced. You have made a special study of the problems pertaining thereto. So in this respect we learn something from you.<query> what is the influence of a life</query> In certain other fields you learn from us which goes to prove that friendly international intercourse is a great medium of education as well as being the greatest factor in the maintenance of goodwill and understanding between nations. Men, and women who think only of their own immediate interests, and there are millions, lack vision. Their souls never find expression and are stifled. Men and women who think nationally have a broader, yet not the broadest, outlook. They who think internationally think of all men. To think internationally is to think like God. You and I in our own way and through the instrumentality of our chosen and common profession are today together. Americans and Canadians bound by the ties of relationship, in, that we speak a common language and in that our traditions, honorable in the extreme can be traced back to a common ancestry, and you are not ashamed of the old mother that gave you birth.<query> who thinks internationally</query> I am speaking now of your nation. We call you cousins but let me say that when the International Peace Garden is established, as it surely will, and when the international line is removed from its centre and when our governments neutralize it, we will be able to call you brothers and sisters, for all who visit this great neutral area, peoples of all nations of the world, will be citizens of that land. Today, according to our laws, you are aliens and foreigners. Recently I visited the United States and I belonged to the foreign class, but I see the day approaching when by reason of our getting together through the building of our great Fortress of Friendship, the Peace Garden, the word ""alien"" will be removed from the statute books of both countries and as long as Americans and Canadians are law-abiding it will not matter under which flag they sojourn.<query> when is the peace garden established</query> In conclusion will you permit me to say, and in this may there be inspiration. Your work is immortal, if anything on earth is immortal. If the painted canvas shall be treasured and so endure so shall those beauty spots you create be preserved and treasured. The results of your work are like the friendships you make today. Time shall not efface them; a century hence their verdure shall be as green, the trees as beautiful, and the ties of friendship the stronger, for such things are handed down from generation to generation. Beauty, friendship and love are all akin and in and through and round about them is God—and so they shall endure. In that great spirit of everlasting friendship Canada welcomes you. A spirit that will not tolerate any cloud to darken the international horizon; a spirit that long ago leveled the mountains of prejudice and has done so much to bring about such meetings as these where international friendships find their greatest expression and are cemented in indissoluble bonds.<query> what is the meaning of the painting friendship</query> In the Spirit of God—inspired friendship—which is the spirit of Canada and of the Peace Garden, you are welcomed. One day your people and ours and all peoples will throng the portals of a magnificent garden. Eyes will feast upon its beauty and be illumined with a new light. Hearts will be uplifted with a new hope and songs will rise to tongues which never sang. Children will join the chorus and the whole world will become akin. On that day will come the realization that the two great English speaking nations have set up an unparalleled and unprecedented example of love to the world. With it will also comes the realization that the hope of peace on earth and goodwill between nations as exemplified by ours, may forever endure. Hope that hellish war may forever be banished. So will the men and women who love beauty and the boys and girls born of these with the wisdom of years and the towering faith and vision of youth remove the mountains of hatred, of prejudice, and of envy and build an insurmountable barrier in the way of those who foment war—a barrier of love and create and leave to the world its most beautiful and significant memorial.<query> what is the spirit of the peace garden</query> Can the members of any organization have a greater influence than that? Is any work more conducive to friendly international relationship than yours? ""There is no death—what seems so is transition"". May this address be vibrant with life. May it convey the thought that good work well done, the beautiful thing created, will never be laid aside, but will continue through the years an example to those who follow and as a memorial to the integrity of those of your profession who went before. Now may I welcome you from the depth of my own in the words of an original poem! A LAND WITHOUT A LINE You came to the land of the Maple Leaf And we met you with a smile, We took your hands in a friendly grasp And hoped you'd stay a while. Though you live 'neath the Stars and Stripes And we 'neath the Union Jack, We speak the same old mother tongue— Uncle Sam and Jack Canuck.<query> who said there is no death—what seems so is transition</query> Between us runs three thousand miles, A line from coast to coast, Where never a fort and never a gun Is seen, we proudly boast. No bayonet with its murderous steel, No sentry anywhere, And we live in peace on either side As though no line were there. Side by side for a hundred years, May it be a thousand more! With never a word to cause us grief Nor any to make us sore. We have lived, and still the Union Jack And stars and Stripes unfurled Have flown together on the line The wonder of the world. Please God, till earth's last sun shall set And earth's last tear be shed, May we two nations still be friends When to heaven Thou call’st Thy dead.<query> where is the union jack</query> Until on that eternal morn As its glorious sun shall shine, Thy nations meet around Thy throne In a land without a line.

Let us take a burial ground conducted strictly upon the lawn system, say for instance, Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, where every surrounding indicates quietness and repose; the beautifully kept lawns, or open spaces surrounded by, or dotted with trees and shrubs bearing foliage of different hues, and shades of green. Each of these lawns or spaces are beautiful pictures in themselves, the trees being planted to throw light and shade on the sward heightens the beauty of the picture, and the effect upon the spectator is soothing and commands silent admiration. The very somberness of the surroundings indicates repose, and the mind immediately associates itself with the idea of the suitability of the cemetery as a final resting place. Beds planted with brightly colored flowers upon such lawns would be extremely out of harmony with the surroundings, and would not be desirable.<query> what is the meaning of flowers in a cemetery</query> Flower planting, no matter how artistically the work is done, is palpably artificial, and in the majority of cemeteries, out of place. A modern cemetery should appear as natural as possible. Imagine a nicely graded section adorned with trees and shrubs; the landscape artist has expended his energies in making it appear as perfectly natural as possible. A lot owner, whose portion is probably in the most prominent part, conceives the idea of having bed upon, or a border around his lot; the graves are also adorned with plants until the lot has the appearance of what a brother superintendent justly describes as a crazy patch-work quilt. No doubt the work is artistic, it does not harmonize with the surroundings, and to the trained eye of a landscape gardener the effect is harsh in the extreme. Lot owners, as a rule, care nothing for the harmonious appearance of the whole.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> To the individual lot is what they desire to call attention. One great aim of a cemetery superintendent should be to educate the people to the fact that ""in simplicity there is beauty;"" that a cemetery should look natural and park-like, and that the general appearance of the whole should be studied, rather than any particular spot. A stupendous task, more especially, in localities where the residents migrated from parts where the modern cemetery system is unknown. To their minds the old country churchyard, with its heterogeneous mass of flowers and vegetation is beautiful, and exactly what a burial ground should be. A few days ago the writer counted no less than 34 plants of different varieties, including mint upon a four-foot grave. Nothing can persuade the owner that it is not the most beautiful grave in the cemetery.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery superintendent</query> To prevent this class of ornamentation will require stringent rules, the enforcement of which means unpopularity, and few officials care to have their cemeteries unpopular. Several who have tried arbitrary rules in this direction have had to modify them in obedience to public feeling. There are many first class cemeteries where flower planting is extensively practiced, these are now being styled “flower garden cemeteries”. The question of the desirability of flower planting is settled as far as they are concerned. There are also burial grounds where flower planting would prove an improvement, but these places can scarcely be classed among the lawn cemeteries. They are simply grave yards, no great amount of landscape work having been lavished on their construction, and the management “a sort of go-as-you-please”. Then again, there is the dollars and cents side of the question.<query> what is flower planting in cemeteries</query> In the majority of cemeteries, both large and small, the desire to make money is paramount, and what should be has to give way to the mighty dollar. So few can afford to sacrifice cash to sentiment, and as most cemeteries are conducted for the money there is in them, flower planting will be encouraged. It is business, simply business. Where flower planting is considered desirable, study should be given to the use, as much as possible, of dwarf growing plants and such as bear flowers, quiet in color, for in few instances do the brighter colors harmonize with the surroundings of a burial ground. For cemetery work nothing looks worse than a bed containing a mixture of tall growing plants, such as dahlias, lilies, salvia, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks and others too numerous to enumerate. Pretty effects can be obtained with dwarf growing plants, especially when massed, and they are not so visible from a distance, therefore their appearance is not so striking, nor is the appearance of the lawn so broken as by their taller brethren.<query> what kind of plants are grown in cemeteries</query> For many years I purchased seed from specialists and had a failure each time, then I purchased strong plants which flowered well and in a hot season produced abundance of seeds which I had sown immediately it was ripe, under this treatment I produced thousands of plants. Bulbs. As the cultivation of hyacinths, snowdrops, scillas, crocus and similar spring bulbs is so well known I do not propose to offer any remarks on them. I trust this short paper has interested you as it is my earnest desire to do.

H. Hadley Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that I owe you a little bit of apology in appearing here with what comparatively little I have to show you.<query> what is a good shrub for planting</query> I had expected to show slides, which I always figure save me a lot of work because what the slides show I do not have to tell you, but unfortunately for me, at least, my slides apparently were lost on the way and have not shown up and in the very short time allowed me for tracing the slides and finding other illustrated material to show you I was unable to find very much. At this season of the year most of the material of this type is out on the road at fairs and other similar places. However, I will try to make up for the lack of actual material by explaining as we go along. You are particularly interested, I assume, in the question of the relation of this insect to industry which you people are representing, and I will try to confine my general remarks to that particular phase of the proposition.<query> what is the purpose of the slides</query> Before going much further I just want to pass around two mounts, one on each side, which show the insect itself in the various stages and two small samples of leaves showing the general way in which it attacks the foliage. Now a little about this insect and how it got here, and so forth. As you surmise from the name of the insect ""Japanese Beetle"", it is a native of the islands of Japan and of a certain few nearby islands in that part of the world. So far as we know the insect arrived in this country prior to 1916, and probably somewhere around 1910 to 1912, as a grub or soft grub about the roots of Japanese plants probably the Iris or Azalea or a similar variety, the roots of which come in the soil. It was first found in New Jersey in the vicinity of Riverton which is about nine miles above Camden, on the Jersey shore of the Delaware River in the summer of 1916.<query> where did the japanese beetle come from</query> At the time two inspectors of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture found it, not knowing what it was, but merely recognizing that it was something new to them and not a habitat found in this part of the country as far as they knew, and after a. little searching around there, being enthusiastic collectors as well as official inspectors, they tried to find as many individuals as they could to work with it. They found in the neighborhood of a dozen or so within a quarter mile radius of this same field. It happened to be along the edge of a little creek running through there where they found them. Four years after that, in 1920, one man collected in about two hours' time six quarts of the beetles. Now there are relatively 3500 beetles in a pint or 7000 in a quart so you can judge from that something of the increase in numbers of the insect since that time.<query> where are beetles found</query> The insect has spread annually, as we believe, at a definite rate from the original point of infestation, at the rate of five to ten miles per year in all directions. That we believe to be the normal actual spread of the insect in new environment. The map I have here which I will open up (does so); shows color variations which indicate the gradual spread of the insect from the original point of infestation. You will notice the different colors represent the spread year by year from the original point of infestation, which point is in the centre of the map here, and a scale of the map is an inch to a mile. You can get a good idea from that as to the rate of spread. This is the City of Philadelphia here (indicating) the Delaware River running up to Trenton, up here towards New York; this being Riverton right up here, and the original point of infestation about three miles out from the town.<query> how fast do insects spread</query> That represents, as well as we have any example, the comparatively steady spread of an insect in a new locality, steady and uniform, and we do not expect to be able to prevent that yearly spread, the actual spread of the insect. At the present time the infested area, or rather up to the beginning of the present season. the middle of June, the infested area covered 770 square miles, the increase being from less than one-half a square mile in 1916. So far as is known the insect does not occur any place in the world other than this infested area in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and its original home country in and near the islands of Japan; and one phase of our work, namely, quarantine enforcement is aimed to prevent as far as possible the widespread distribution of this insect.<query> where do mosquitoes live</query> Now a little as to the life history; you are more or less acquainted with a class of insects closely related to this Japanese Beetle, that is, the May beetles or June beetles, as they are commonly called. This Japanese insect belongs to the same general family of Mayor June beetles. If we start at the present season for instance to trace the life history throughout the year just now we are in the tail end of the beetle season. At the present time the progeny of the present beetle generation, the eggs and grub which have hatched from that, is in the ground feeding. They will remain here all winter and until next spring as a grub, increasing in size, at least increasing up to real cold weather and then hibernating for the winter and recommencing growth in the spring up until we will say about the middle of May.<query> what is the life cycle of a june beetle</query> Then there is a transformation, still under the ground, to what we know as the pupa stage. For instance, you are acquainted with the June beetle caterpillar, the beetle in the intermediate stage that is the cocoon, it is the intermediate stage. This stage lasts apparently about two weeks. The earliest beetles commence hatching between the 10th and 15th of June. Throughout the rest of the summer then there is a continuous hatching of the beetles. But the height of the season is from the latter part of June through July and early August that completes the life history for the year. There is but one generation per year so far as we know. A single female beetle will lay on an average of 30 to 60 eggs during her laying period which extends practically through the season of the beetle flight from the latter part of June until early August.<query> when do beetles hatch</query> Now, to give you an idea of the ability of this species to carry itself through and to show how it withstands adverse conditions. It does not breed as rapidly as some other insects but it has practically 100 percent of young that come through to maturity. To illustrate that point I will cite this one example. Two or three years back we were interested in finding out how many eggs would hatch and mature, so for a number of days we collected 100 eggs a day for a period of three weeks, taking them from different places in the soil and we averaged 99 or slightly better than that in the average of each 100 eggs hatched and the grub surviving. In another test we collected 1200 eggs in one day from a number of points, brought them into the laboratory, each egg was put in a small tin an inch in diameter, in soil and kept to determine the hatching, and we were able to hatch out exactly 1200 larvae from the 1200 eggs.<query> how many eggs hatch in a day</query> In other words, the insect in all stages is very resistant to adverse conditions, which explains why we have such an increase in the comparatively few years it has been here. Now a little bit about the habits of the insect: The more injurious stage is the parent beetles. We have records of their feeding on something over 200 different species of plants. I think it is about 220 including useful and cultivated varieties as well as non-useful weed varieties. There are certain different preferences they make. They show a preference for certain weeds such as smart weed, alder and mallow. Unfortunately, however, their preference is not strong enough to allow them or to keep them feeding on the weed varieties only and there seems to be a notable tendency, as the insect becomes better established, to leave the weed varieties for the cultivated varieties.<query> what is the most injurious stage of a beetle</query> There is only one cultivated class, ornamental, that is distinctly free of attack from the insect and that is the conifer group, arbor vitae, pines, hemlocks, all that class. We have no record of their feeding on that class of plants. Now, from your standpoint it is quite possible that the grub, or young form, will be equally, if not more seriously destructive because of the fact that they feed on the roots of plants, particularly grass. Now, they are comparatively a small grub and a few grubs in the sod we will say don't make any appreciable difference. I mean by that 100 to 150 per square yard. It sounds quite a few but from our angle it is not. Now they begin to be real serious when they run up to three to five hundred grubs to the square yard.<query> what kind of plants do grubs eat</query> Under these conditions you can and will get serious injury to the sod, particularly in the fall, and especially if that is followed by a hard winter there will be a good deal of dying out of the sod. Now, when they get what we call real dense, that is, over 500 to the square yard, then you are pretty sure to get serious injury. To give you an idea of how high they may go, a year ago this fall the highest infestation we found was 1035 grub in a measured square yard in the golf course at Riverton. That is a good many grubs. That figure is not simply based on one examination but an average of several in the most heavily infested places. We thought that was about the limit that could be reached but an examination already this fall, just beginning there, seems to promise a figure running up close to 1500.<query> how many grubs in a square yard</query> You can realize that that degree of infestation may be called a heavy infestation and undoubtedly will give lots of trouble. Now, a little about the work we are doing at Riverton because we all have run into at least the quarantine phase of it at one time or another; if you have not, you will, especially in the purchase of nursery stock from this part of the country. The work is divided into certain main phases: For instance, part has to do with the study of the life history, the habits of the insect in, the new environment, the changes from year to year as it becomes better acclimated, and so forth. Another line has to do with the importation and distribution of parasites which we hope will eventually hold the insect in reasonable check. In Japan the insect is not of any economical importance itself.<query> what is the quarantine phase of a bug</query> They have occasional outbreaks where it does some damage and they collect a lot by hand and destroy them; but I suppose in 100 years there has not been the amount of injury occasioned in Japan that there has been in the last two years in the heavily infested areas of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There are two reasons for the apparent non-importance of the insect in Japan. One is the cultural practices of the country. There is practically no waste land; everything is intensively cultivated, so that the opportunities for the insect to breed in large numbers are very limited. The breeding places chosen are grass fields, pastures and waste lands in general, and, of course, around this part of the country there are plenty of them. The other reason for the lack of serious injury in Japan is the presence of native natural enemies of the insect; in other words, there are insects which prey upon it, which we commonly call parasites.<query> why are there no insect in japan</query> These parasites we know to be present there in reasonable abundance. We have now three or four men in that part of the world who are studying the situation and sending us parasites as fast as they have material available. The parasite material is shipped to us and it is taken care of at the laboratory. Some times it comes at the time of year and at the stage where the parasites can be released immediately in the infested area. Other shipments come in such a way that the material must be carried over during the winter or at least during a season before the conditions are right for the material to be released. The ultimate object of holding this insect down to a point where it can no longer be a serious pest lies in the shipment of a sufficient sequence of parasite enemies to keep the number of the host down to a reasonable small limit.<query> when do parasites come in</query> Eventually possibly certain of the native parasites existing here, the normal beetle related species to the Japanese beetle will also attack the Japanese beetle. But the main reliance must be placed upon the known natural enemies which must be brought over. Now, it will take quite a few years before the parasites can be brought to the point where they are practically proficient in keeping this pest under reasonable control. As to removing from the class of dangerous insects, we do not stress that point very much; it may be ten to fifty years; and nobody is in position to give an estimate. Meanwhile the insect is increasing and spreading and is causing damage and is going to do more. Therefore, other important phases of our work have to do with the development of methods to control the pest, not only from the standpoint of the destruction of the parent beetle itself but also for the destruction of the grubs in the soil.<query> how long does it take to get rid of japanese beetle</query> The insect or beetle is quite resistant to the ordinary poisons such as arsenate of lead, Paris green, etc., that are commonly employed, or at least they are wise enough to know enough to let them alone. It is an open question as yet even whether beetles simply won't feed very much on arsenate of lead, for instance, or whether they will eat just enough arid know when it is well to stop. The fact remains that arsenate of lead, as a common insecticide, we have not yet been able to say will kill a large number of the beetles. It does give a certain amount of relief, but not many eases are very satisfactory in the prevention of injury to the foliage by simply driving the beetles from the sprayed trees to places where the spray is not present. That is a sort of backhanded way of getting at it and of course, if carried on continuously will, eventually devolve on the proposition of driving them from one place to another.<query> what kills beetles</query> We are working on that angle seeking to find a material which will kill a bulk of the insects which feed upon it, which is, safe to use on the foliage without resulting injury to the foliage and with which the cost of using is not excessive. From the standpoint of grub destruction we are also carrying on considerable work. It is possible to destroy the grub by using the sodium cyanide solution and spraying it or applying it to the infested soil. It will kill 90 to 95 percent of the grubs in the soil in the early fall while they are close to the surface. The drawback is the cost. The material runs from $60 to $75 per acre, not counting the cost of labor and the fact that special equipment is necessary to apply it. I believe that most of us will agree that the cost is excessive and certainly it is from the standpoint of the average farm land.<query> cost to destroy grubs</query> We are concerned, therefore, in finding a cheaper method of treatment and we believe we have found a satisfactory material in a carbon disulphide emulsion which will be satisfactory at least the two years of experimental work dealing with this material have given very satisfactory results. Another phase of the work is the quarantine. As I mentioned in the first place, we do not expect to be able to prevent the normal yearly spread of the insect, averaging between five and ten miles a year; in fact, if we had nothing but that to consider we would not have much to consider because it would take many years to go a long distance. But when we consider the fact that the insects can be spread in one year or even less, the actual spread will occur in one week through the shipment of infected nursery stock from one side of the country to the other and you realize why it is we lay so much stress upon the quarantine, a quarantine that simply restricts and controls the movement of nursery stock to places outside, does not absolutely prohibit but allows the movement only under conditions which will not spread the insect; in other words, shipments of the type which will not carry the insect are allowed, other shipments are not.<query> how long does it take for a bug to spread</query> Now, as the time is going on, it is getting a little late, I do not want to take up any more time unless you have specific questions. I will call your attention, if interested, to the circular which has been issued or printed describing the insect, its habits, etc., of which I do not have a supply with me, but if you are interested you can get copies by simply writing us for them. This is a small circular describing the insect, its habits, and giving a colored enlargement of the beetle itself, and can be secured by addressing the Japanese Beetle Laboratory at Riverton, New Jersey, or the Department of Agriculture here at Harrisburg. Now we have gone over this rather briefly and hastily. If any of you have questions I will be very glad to answer them, if possible.<query> where is the japanese beetle laboratory</query> From the publication: AACS - Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Harrisburg, PA August 20, 21, 22 and 23, 1923 Code: A1085 1920-1939 horticulture japanese beetle pest trees Add new comment Why The Cemetery Should be A Garden Date Published: September, 1920 Original Author: W.E. Groves Hamilton, Ontario Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 34th Annual Convention At first sight it may seem presumptuous to talk to an audience of this character on the subject set for me, ""Why the Cemetery Should Be a Garden”. The life business of so many of you is more or less a practical demonstration of the widely accepted principle indicated and looking at the matter from the viewpoint of a plain gardener, the best I can hope to do is to emphasize some of the apparent reasons and with special good fortune; stimulating afresh some thought along these lines.<query> when was the cemetery published</query> What is a garden? The word has probably outgrown in this country its original etymological meaning, “an enclosed space"" and might now be better described as a cultivated space especially cared for. When we recall all the thought, care and attention on devoted today to the gardens of this and other countries it is not difficult to accept this meaning. Adding to this the idea of rest, beauty, memory, faith and hope, it is not far to the great idea that is a place at once so near the human and the divine, that to very many it becomes the most hallowed spot on earth. This is not by any means a fancy picture, and I feel quite safe in the statement: ""Rest, comrades, rest and sleep The thoughts of men shall be As sentinels to keep Your rest from danger free.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> ""Your silent tents of green We deck with fragrant flowers Yours has the suffering been The memory shall be ours."" Linking up the garden idea with the cemetery, may I suggest first, that there is at least some traditional warrant for the assumption that the ""sleeping place"" should have the garden characteristic? Definite statement and perfectly permissible inference shows that again and again in the dim past the thought of garden ""enclosure"" was associated with burial. The cave in a field bought and set aside for a patriarchal burying place being used for more than one generation, at least suggests care. Again “there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulcher, there they laid him” are words covering another familiar instance of the garden tomb. Church history still further confirms the fact that for centuries the garden idea and garden care has been associated with the grounds used as last resting places.<query> what is the garden in a cemetery</query> If in these early years the results were crude, they were probably not more crude than much of the other life of the age. Horticulture in its fine development deserves to rank among any of the arts of sciences, with the result that in present day conditions we can easily find another strong reason for the statement that the cemetery should be a garden. Never in the history of the world has there been such an appreciation of and love for the beautiful in nature as there is today. Statistics on such a subject as this seem out of place, but the assertion can be easily proved by those who delight in the analytical. In this land, as well as in many others, the value of the artistic as a psychological asset is becoming a real factor in commercial life. Home life, town and city life, as well as business life demand this as a positive essential to the progress of civilization.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> Given these conditions it is not far to carry the idea to the last sleeping place, thereby claiming that to keep pace with the times the cemetery should constantly prove the presence of a real horticultural guardian. It should be artistic without being exotic, full of landscape beauty, without being a horticultural exhibition. It might well be a place where spreading lawns, shade-giving trees, blooming shrubs and the song of birds combine to make it a hallowed place for the dead, and a lovely spot for the living. Irrespective of the size of the community served a modern cemetery is almost of necessity rural. Is there not here another strong reason for the hand of the gardener where the influence on the immediate neighborhood is bound to be felt? Just as one good garden on a street is sometimes the inspiration to change the whole character of the street, the impression gathered from a real garden burial ground must be helpful in the district where it is placed.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> As an asset to the town or city there is some value due to the fact that being so often at one of its entrances the visitor gets right here his first and often most lasting impression. This point is worth mentioning, but I do not labor it; passing on to say a word or two on the more definite aspects of the subject. The cemetery should be a garden because it is a place of rest. Any student of horticulture will confirm the statement that the idea of restfulness is directly associated with gardens. The best garden planners constantly have this in mind. The glaring and the gaudy both in color and form are omitted from worth while designing, and in their place there is a striving after the harmony which means variety in unity, that peacefulness of effect, which is but another name for restfulness.<query> why is a cemetery a garden</query> Landscaping has yet to be treated in this convention and I do not intrude, but I may be allowed the statement that the tendency of the best landscape gardeners is to avoid shocks and to emphasize quietness, to put an embargo on the merely artificial, that the natural may be accentuated. A true garden brings rest to practically all the senses in the very highest degree, and because of this fact I am unhesitating in the statement that man's last earthly sleeping place in its. environment may well be the most restful of all. Sentiment if you like but one of life's sentiments that we can ill afford to miss. The association of beauty with the garden is yet another reason for the hand of the gardener in the cemetery. Beautification, merely amounting to beautification of home surroundings, is now so general that the idea has almost become an accepted principle.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> Next to the growing for food, the first thought about a garden is beauty. We have looked at this from a general point of view but is especially true of the individual. Both the garden and the grave have about them much of the personal touch and even granting that the sense of beauty does not invariably appear in the garden the call to beauty is nearly always felt in connection with the cemetery lot. Beauty of design, beauty of construction and beauty down to the smallest detail is increasingly demanded, and in these days when by common consent we pay every respect to our honored dead, beauty of surroundings surely has a place. The idea of memory in this connection is so obvious that it needs hardly more than mere mention. The tree planters of one generation call for thankful remembrance by the next from an economic point of view.<query> what is the meaning of beauty in the garden</query> The garden that counts its timely decades rather than years naturally has clustered around it the most sacred memories. Whilst the almost imperishable record in granite and marble is strikingly imposing, the memory of past generations will assuredly be sweeter if it is in part associated with trees. And if in the march of time the cemeteries of the cities reach the point where they are past serving their original purpose and to some extent become city breathing places for crowded districts, the practiced hand of the gardener will be revealed where tree and shrub, grass and flower, are blending in nature's finest harmony, the place in very truth becoming a memorial to those who have passed into the unknown. Is it too much to claim for both the garden and the cemetery that they are the homes of faith and hope? A fine text for a sermon, but I refrain from preaching.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> I am talking to men who can appreciate the idea, being so closely associated with both the aspects suggested, and I venture to submit that there is no profession on earth calling for more constant exercise of these two virtues than that of the man who plants. His hope in the eternal round of the seasons, his trust in the seed he sows, his confidence in the coming of seed-time and harvest bring him constantly close up to the miracles of growth. There is no labor in the universe bringing such reward, no work providing such thrills of joy, no occupation giving such a sense of completeness, content and blessing. And if this be so, I am bold to ask: Do I claim too much in the statement that the garden conception should be closely associated with the burial ground? If there is any real connection between nature and nature's God, surely it can be found where every bud and bloom, every leaf and twig, every branch and every tree, bears silent witness to the faith and hope of man in immortality.<query> what is the connection between the garden and the burial ground</query> And if at times the great phrase ""I am the resurrection and the Life"" fall on the ears of those too stricken to hear, the humble flower at our feet stands out in glorious confirmation. The ""sure and certain hope"" finds its eternal witness in the very blades of grass on which we stand. So I venture to submit to you this morning these simple reasons among many others for the assumption that the cemetery should be a garden. It is at once a pleasure and an honor to speak along these lines to a body of men who by intuition and training are so alive to these great facts, men whose life business it is to make easy some of the darkest hours of their fellows, men who spend their time trying to make the cemetery a fitting place for the living, as well as for the dead, men who have the touch of fine taste and are full of the finer feelings, and I am sure my appeal does not fall on deaf ears.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> The flowers of France hallowed because they grow in soil fertilized by the blood of our noblest and best-were silent witnesses to deeds of valor for the great cause of liberty and truth. Are not the same flowers a perpetual reminder as they grow in quietness round our homes and round our tombs, that man lives in deeds, not years, that high ideals and courage dignify and ennoble life, that the way of life leads through the gates of death, and that life alone is worth while which has in it the elements of chivalry, bravery, beauty and truth.

You need to create a hole; it needs to be much wider than the root ball. It's sometimes good to enrich the soil. Whenever you plant a tree, or any plant, you're damaging some of its roots, and you're going to have to give it a little TLC. You want to have a healthy root system that will expand. You want to provide some kind of inducement so that it will expand. Roots are stupid, they're lazy, they'll take the path of least resistance. So if you have a tiny little hole, what are they going to do? They aren't going to try to push through hard dirt. They're just going to travel around and around, and around—until they stop working.<query> how to make a hole for a tree</query> The subject is of such importance as to merit the earnest attention of all.

Seed of all the varieties of grasses I have named can now be had, although in some cases not free from chaff, yet, just as free from weeds as Blue Grass or White Clover. To obtain such, it naturally, follows, that a higher price has to be paid than would be the case if impure seeds were offered: but the difference in the actual cost is so small that this can hardly be considered a factor. I presume that quite a number of you will not agree with me in my conclusions. I hope, however, you will defer judgment until you have had opportunity to compare the result of a two or three kind mixture with a properly balanced lawn grass made up from six or eight varieties.

If space will permit, allow for cultivation by horse-power between the rows and ample room for two or three seasons growth, without crowding be¬tween the plants in rows. This work only requires a commencement, and in a very short time the diligent beginner will have on hand a valuable and interesting collection of plants and shrubs, native and foreign, suited to his own special wants. After the nursery is fairly started, I would recommend the purchase of a standard treatise on the general nature of plants and make a study of them; so that we may work from established principles, and fully comprehend the object of every operation performed and their cultivation.

So if there's a nutrient deficiency, where you'll see it is in the older leaves, because the plant is kind of feeding on itself. If you see new green growth and old yellow growth, it's more than likely due to a nutrient deficiency. There are also a host of minor nutrients. If you're in a place that has high rainfall, molybdenum and sulphur can become deficient—they literally get washed out of the soil. Molybdenum is necessary for plants to be able to use nitrogen. Places in the Southeast often have a molybdinum deficiency. You can replace nitrogen, but if you don't replace the micronutrients, you're not going to get full use of the fertilizer.<query> why do plants grow yellow</query> Ninety five percent or more of the problems you have in your landscape are going to be cultural. If you have good cultural practices you're not going to have these problems. Trees: Never be afraid to reject trees that come in. If you order them, you're the customer and you don't have to accept them. They grow a lot of junk out there. If the tree has a stake next to the trunk, get it off immediately. It's bad for the tree; it's tree abuse. Cutting off branches: Unfortunately, in years past, we told people to cut them off against the trunk and we did it so well that now we're having a problem trying to let people know that we told you wrong. So don't cut a limb flush. And don't paint the spot afterward, because then you seal in moisture and you can get rot.<query> what is the best way to keep a tree from growing</query> I trust I may be pardoned if I have seemed over zealous on this subject but I am sure that no set flower bed or clump of shrubbery that can be planted will receive as much admiration and praise as a well stocked lily pond.

If you trim the branches all the way up to make it look like what we think a tree should look like, then it becomes a sail—it catches the wind and doesn't distribute it all the way through—and then you have a problem.

M. Keller Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 17th Annual Convention That herbaceous plants deserve all the attention which they receive now by the best landscapers, when laying out new grounds or when called upon to alter, improve or partially replant and renovate older establishments, may not be generally admitted, still the fact remains that there are advantages in hardy plants and it is a fact that in late years thousands of these plants are employed, where twenty or thirty years ago only a few dozen were used-it is not a passing fashion for the demand is constantly growing; showing that with each year they gain in popularity and that their merits are more and more appreciated.<query> when was the aacs convention</query> Annual Convention Of all the work pertaining to horticulture there is none so difficult to write about as the planting and pruning of trees and it is almost impossible for one to learn how to do the work by reading for the fact that no two trees are alike. Whoever studies the varied beauties of trees will find that they possess almost a human interest, and their features will reveal varieties of expression, and charms of character, that dull observers cannot imagine. No tree has the highest beauty of its type without the appearance, in its whole bearing, of robust vigor. There may be peculiar charms in the decay of an old trunk, or the eccentric habit of some stunted specimen which ministers to the love of the picturesque; but tree beauty and health are as inseparable in trees as in humanity. Luxuriant vigor is, then, the essential condition of all beautiful trees but thriftiness cannot make an elm look like an oak, but rather brings into higher relief the distinguishing marks of each, making the elm more graceful and the oak more majestic.<query> what is the beauty of trees</query> It is always profitable to give time to intelligent preparation of the soil to receive the trees and to be sure that the roots are kept in a moist condition until established in the new ground, Excavate the soil from a space wide and deep enough to provide for the root growth, throw back the soil so that your trees when planted in the middle of the prepared space will have a deep, mellow bed in which to extend their roots. In planting, the tree should be set in the ground no deeper than it grew in the nursery, which depth may be determined by discoloration of the bark at the base. More trees die from this one cause than from any other. Any broken or injured roots should be pruned so that the ends be smooth. It transplanting trees I would advise liberal doses of old manure or wood ashes.<query> how deep should a tree be planted</query> It is surprising how the roots revel in ground containing such ingredients. Another important factor for quick and luxurious growth is to form basins around the trees in order to catch the water. It is, besides that, a safeguard against the lawn mower. Never allow any grass to grow near your young trees; keep the basins always free of weeds and have the soil stirred up two or three times during the summer and in winter put some short manure on to keep out the cold, and also to serve as a mulch. Be sure to have the basins large enough, never less than one foot in diameter; two feet is much better. You ask--When is the best time to plant trees and my answer is: plant whenever the weather conditions are favorable. There are so many conditions that may work out all right for the grower in a certain locality, but would be the wrong procedure in another locality.<query> when is the best time to plant trees</query> There are some pretty and useful forms of the common box (Buxus) such as naviculatis, Handsworthi and microphylla, which are quite hardy under partial shade. A recently introduced form of the laurel from the Balkan Mountains, said to be very hardy, has been under trial in the Ellwanger & Barry nursery for some years and is reported by them to be very satisfactory. As a broad-leaved evergreen this should be very important. In conclusion, outside the coniferous evergreens the number of flowering and other evergreens suitable for planting in ornamental grounds in this latitude is really not large and not sufficiently extensive, or of that nature so as to produce any marked or broad effect on our landscapes in this climate.

Davey Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 41st Annual Convention I came to tell you a little bit about the tree as a living thing.<query> what kind of trees are in the balkan mountains</query> Probably most folks do not realize that the tree is a living, breathing organism. We know it in a sort of an abstract sense, and yet we are not likely to be actively conscious of the fact that it is a living, breathing organism. As a matter of fact the tree is just as much alive as a man. It not only breaths, but it has a circulation, it digests its food, it has sex processes. The tree breathes largely through its leaves and I hope sometime all of you may take occasion to examine the leaf of a tree under a microscope. On the upper side you will see a myriad of cells or little openings into which the air penetrates just as truly as it does into the human lungs. In those cells the air is separated into its parts, the carbon dioxide is extracted from the air and is used as a part of the food material of the tree, or the plant.<query> what is the tree</query> As a matter or fact the tree is just a big plant taken by and large and the oxygen is thrown off for the benefit of man and all animal life. The process is opposite from that in our bodies. There is no bellows in the breathing process in the leaf, but the breathing is just as real and just as vital as in our bodies, and it continues as long as the leaves are green. There is also a complete circulation in the tree. Of course it doesn't move around and around rapidly in response to heart action, and yet it does run the complete course from the little hair roots down in the ground up to the leaves and back again. Just imagine you are looking at a cross section of a tree, that is the same as the top of a stump, and of course in these days when it is a popular pastime to cut trees down, you can find stumps anywhere.<query> why do trees breathe</query> Imagine you are looking at the top of a stump. In the center you see the pit that was there from the time it was a baby, around that is a layer of wood which represents the first year's growth. Around that is a second layer of wood which represents the second year's growth. Around that is a third layer of wood which represents the third year's growth, and so on to the bark. In the beginning when the tree was young and small the central cells were not only structural supports as they are all the time but they were active sap carrying tissue. The cells of a tree overlap each other and they are hollow. In the beginning when they are young there is an opening from one cell to another. So, when the tree was young and smart these central cells were active sap carrying tissue and it was through them that the sap moved upward.<query> when a tree is young and small the central cells are</query> But as the, tree grew in size the central cells became more fined up with mineral elements and therefore more dormant, so, as you go outward toward the bark you find the lust few outside layers of wood, the active sap carrying tissue in those largely. The sap travels upward from the roots to the leaves, imagine, if you will, that you had the power to take from the ground a tree and wash the dirt away from the roots. If you uprooted a tree and washed the dirt away you would see a magnificent structure, a wonderful top balanced by an equally large and magnificent root system. If the top is 50 feet across, the root area is also approximately fifty feet, and at the end of that root system largely are the little hair roots that take up the food in liquid form, send it up through the sap wood of the trunk, out to the leaves, where it undergoes a marvelous change, it is transformed, and then it comes back in the inner cells of the bark, in its digested form, depositing itself all the way down until finally some of it reaches the same little roots from whence it came—so you have a complete circulation that is active as long as the leaves are green.<query> where does sap come from</query> May I suggest that in order to have that circulation you must have leaves, because they are the vital connecting link, and that is why I suppose God Almighty put the leaves on trees. It is one of the reasons, anyway, and it is why there is such a terrible crime in chopping the tops of trees off, that I will refer to later. The digestion which occurs in the leaf is one of the most interesting things that happens in all the realms of life. I shall make bold to say that the leaf, speaking broadly, is the most important thing in the world. Of course I expect you to challenge that because it is a ridiculous thing to say that anyone thing is more important than anything else, and yet if you will bear with me I think I can make my case.<query> why are leaves important</query> In order to illustrate what I have in mind I want to relate a story that I read in the New York Times in 1921. You will remember then that the great famine was sweeping over Russia. They were starving to death literally by the hundreds of thousands. The situation was so bad that some of the big city newspapers sent their special correspondents to Russia to inquire into the situation and report by daily letter. In one of these stories I read this incident: the correspondent told how one day they came upon a house where a little child was sick on a couch, covered with a quilt, and it looked as though there were a pillow under the quilt. Its eyes were still and glassy, staring straight upward, it was all but dead. The correspondent looked at the child and looked at the mother and she divining his purpose pulled back the quilt and disclosed a horrible, misshapen body, its little stomach was horribly distended, very much like a kewpie, its arms and legs were emaciated, it was just about breathing its last.<query> when was the russian famine</query> And then she told what had happened. She said hunger had driven them so far that they had fed this child blue clay, the clay stuck to the teeth and the walls of the stomach and would for the time being stay the pangs of hunger, but there was no power in the human system to throw it off, so it lay there. Finally the worms started to work and the end was near. I tell that story realizing that there is in it a touch of horror because it illustrates and emphasizes a profound truth, there are only two minerals that man can take into his system and assimilate—water and salt, and those only in limited quantities. Everything else we eat and almost everything we wear comes to us through the leaves of vegetation. It is the leaf, speaking of vegetation generally, that takes the dead mineral elements from the soil and transforms them into living cells.<query> what two minerals can man take into his system and assimilate</query> The leaf is the one and only connecting link between the organic world and the inorganic world, meaning the world of living cells on the one hand and the world of dead mineral plants on the other. The leaf is the only thing that has the power to transform dead matter into living matter, and therefore it is the foundation of all life. No life could exist upon this earth if it were not for that vital function performed by leaves, and that is why I say the leaf is the most important thing in the world. The tree has sex processes also that are just as real and just as beautiful as in any other form of life. The male and female exist as positive factors. Sometimes you find the male and female in the same flowers, at other times in different flowers on the same tree, and sometimes the flowers of a tree are all male or all female, the pollen is created in the male parts and is carried partly by the wind and partly by insects to the female organs where conception takes place and the continuity of life is made possible.<query> why is the leaf the most important thing in the world</query>"
