Get social Utilities<query> has the sex stopped</query> If that's correct, what keeps a man from having sex even after marriage? ""Mismatch of sexual desire and lack of communication,"" says Kothari, ""commonly caused by personal inhibitions and cultural conditioning."" Conditioning can actually take the spontaneity out of the act, as in the case of New Delhi's Varun Kapoor, 24, who decided to have his first sex at 19 only ""after a lot of discussion"". A responsible move, yes, but it also seems like an act that lacks passion. Lack of passion marks you as a 'good boy' in India. It is surprisingly easy for an Indian man to say ""I'm not interested in sex""-our society approves of that. This is quite different from, say, an American man's situation: he would rather say he has sexual dysfunction than say he is not 'interested'.<query> what keeps a man from having sex after marriage</query> And this data about America come as a revelation: in a country where everyone is supposed to want sex all the time, ""studies show that 45 per cent of married couples have sex just one to three times per month. Thirty-three per cent have sex zero to three times per year. And only eight per cent have sex four or more times per week,"" says Daniel Stein, MD, medical director of the Foundation for Intimacy in Tampa, Florida. You are not alone There are couples who take a joint decision to abstain-like Vohra and his girlfriend- and then there are couples who go sexless simply because one partner doesn't feel up to it. The tide of sexual desire ebbs for various reasons: a new baby, different work hours like in the BPO circle, or generally pushing sex to the bottom of the agenda.<query> how many times a year do couples have sex</query> Again, Indian traditions contribute here: sex before marriage is a sin; sex after marriage is meant for producing children to keep the family tree going. Sex for the sake of sex is considered unimportant. But ""sex is just as health-promoting as vitamins, exercise, and a balanced diet,"" says Dr Stein. ""This is not just a marital issue, but a significant public-health concern."" The Indian law recognises the importance of having a proper sexual relationship within marriage. ""Refusal to have sex with your wife (or husband) is considered mental cruelty and can be a ground for divorce,"" says lawyer Hari Pillai. But what of the times when there is no refusal? When couples, even young ones, simply drift apart? ""The partners function as parents, as bread-winners, as housekeepers, but they're more like brother and sister,"" says Dr Stein.<query> why is it important to have sex before marriage</query> ""Not only does the frequency of intercourse decline, but so does the kissing, hugging and touching."" And this is the crux: when sex wanes, love wanes. ""A relationship is a living thing that needs nourishment to grow. And that nourishment is sex,"" Dr Stein says. Determining whether or not you're in a sex-starved relationship isn't as simple as tallying the number of times you do it. Sexual satisfaction involves much more than frequency. To put your relationship to the test, take the quiz 'Test your relationship'. But keep in mind that there's a natural ebb and flow to sexual relationships. For a situation to be chronic, it must persist for at least six months. If your test score proves you're not scoring enough, don't panic. Experts say the first step to correcting the problem is realising you're not alone.<query> how long does it take for a relationship to get sex</query> ""I've been a marriage therapist for 20 years, and I'd estimate that one in three couples struggles with this issue,"" says Michele Weiner-Davis, author of The Sex-Starved Marriage. ""It affects all types of people, regardless of age or years spent together."" If you and you partner are at sexual odds, here is a multistep programme for breaking the gridlock and restoring intimacy in your relationship: View it as a couple problem. This isn't her fault, nor is it your fault. It's a mutual problem. As Barry McCarthy, PhD, a certified sex therapist, points out, the solution is working together. This simple shift in mindset can make a major difference. Eliminate possible physical causes of low desire. There may be a straightforward biological reason your partner is disinterested in sex.<query> how to break the gridlock in a relationship</query> Becoming a mother, poor body image, stress, fatigue, surgical complications and even the side effects of some drugs (especially antidepressants) can all have a negative impact. Likewise, a man's loss of desire can stem from declining testosterone levels, performance anxiety, fatigue, drinking, job stress or medications. Call a hootchy-kootchy hiatus. If the problem turns out to be psychological, institute a temporary ban on intercourse. By agreeing to have no nooky for a specified period, you'll be taking the heat off whoever is feeling pressured in the relationship. This usually helps that partner relax enough to open up. It'll also show you that there are other ways to express affection. Try this: lie on the bed, close your eyes and ask your partner to touch and massage various parts of your body (genitals are off -limits).<query> what is the best way to stop intercourse</query> Focus on the sensations. Then do the same for her. McCarthy says this teaches you to separate pleasure from performance. Make a date for sex. As your intercourse ban winds down, arrange for a special evening. Dr Stein calls it ""setting the table for sex"". Leave provocative notes for one another, pretend you're dating. One thing you shouldn't do, though, is go out for a big dinner. Save your blood supply for arousing your genitals instead of digesting the mutton biryani. ""Most couples don't spend any time planning for intimacy,"" says Dr Stein, ""but sex is all about expectation."" Just do it. No doubt, the two of you will have a wonderful time on your ""date"". To make sure you follow through, set a time for sex.<query> how to set the table for sex</query> It may sound cold, but new research shows that desire doesn't necessarily precede arousal. ""My clients often say, 'I wasn't in the mood when we started, but once we got into it, I really enjoyed it,'"" says Weiner-Davis. ""Sometimes the hardest part of running is putting on your shoes. So just do it."" Stay connected. To keep a relationship vibrant, you have to communicate. It sounds obvious, but many couples don't do it. You don't have to be each other's best friend or soul mate. All it takes, says Weiner-Davis, is 15 minutes of daily check-in. It doesn't even matter what you talk about; what's important is that you're talking, touching and expressing everyday concern and affection. ""This sort of daily connection and friendship,"" she says, ""is the foundation for keeping sexuality alive.<query> how to keep a relationship alive</query> And this is something worth the keeps."" Make sex Priority One. ""Sex is more important than your career,"" says Dr Stein. You can always change jobs, but if you'd rather not change your girlfriend or wife, have sex. Plus, the longer you abstain, the harder it is to get back in the saddle. Male menopause The myth is passe. It's not only women anymore...men need to wake up, fast. Technically, men do not have menopause. But they do go through a male equivalent called andropause, which is accompanied by symptoms similar in women. Every man is affected differently, but those who do have significantly low levels of testosterone may start noticing a decrease in sex drive, a tendency to be grumpy or tired. Worse, they may feel depressed or anxious.<query> does menopause affect women</query> This leads doctors to prescribe antidepressants rather than testosterone replacement drugs. The message to men is: wake up. It's not just about women anymore, it's about you, too. Source: Sexless and the City, India Today Check your testoterone If your sexual desire is low, the solution may be hormone replacement. Testosterone is the juice of manhood. It helps make muscle grow and hair sprout, and it contributes to aggression and cravings for sex. But the power of this hormone begins to deteriorate after age 24. A significant loss of interest in sex may mean your tank is low. ""Testosterone is the hormone of desire,"" explains Daniel Stein, MD, medical director of the Foundation for Intimacy in Tampa. ""In men, there is an inevitable decline with age that causes them to lose interest and ability.<query> what is the testosterone</query> It's probably the world's best-kept secret: Indian men don't get enough sex, even within marriage or a live-in relationship. You wouldn't guess it from the size of the population, but the truth is sex-health-boosting as it is-is becoming increasingly low-priority among the urban population of a country where intercourse has traditionally been seen as a necessity for keeping the family name alive than an instrument of bonding between the husband and wife. The figures tell the story: the India Today-AC Nielsen sex survey found that 42 per cent of the respondents have sex just one or twice a month. Stress, the usual suspect, takes much of the blame. ""High pay packages come with high stress levels,"" says Dr Rupin Shah, consultant andrologist and micro surgeon, Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, in an interview with India Today.<query> how many men in india have sex</query> So what's wrong may be as simple as low testosterone. If your insulin were too low, you'd have diabetes and you'd get it treated. For most men who lose desire, the problem isn't in their heads; it's in their hormones.""

For reprint rights:Syndications Today.<query> who should you take home to mom</query> Partners are tired from long hours of commute, work load, the pressure to succeed in their profession; comfort foods, smoking, lack of exercise, and a general Indian habit of 'letting ourselves go' after marriage result in an unfit body, even obesity. The damage is often displayed as erectile dysfunction in men. They are not helped by the women, who are themselves generally too exhausted to take the trouble of tempting their husbands. Then there is the pressure from parents to present them with grandchildren almost as soon as a couple weds. The later a man marries-most don't before nearing 30 these days-the greater the demand on him to produce an heir. Failure to do so results in stress and that, in turn, hampers his performance even more-it's a vicious circle.<query> what is the effect of erectile dysfunction on men</query> This has been the fate of Jatin Rajpal, 30, an IT professional in Bengaluru. The feeling that he is not a ""real man"" has pervaded every area of his life as his wife has failed to conceive for the past two years. While many couples get by on very little sex, in extreme cases, they don't get any. Dr Piyush Goyal, a gynaecologist laparoscopic surgeon, cites a married couple, both 24, who came to him because they couldn't consummate their marriage even after four months! Dr Goyal and his colleague Dr Uddhav Raj say that of all the infertility cases that are referred to them, almost 15 per cent of the couples are actually not infertile at all. The reason for their inability to conceive is astounding: ""They just don't know what normal intercourse is,"" says Goyal.<query> why do couples get married and can't conceive</query> Even now, the Indian man's attitude towards sex is full of ambivalence-to do or not to do it? The average age of losing his virginity is the highest in the world-22.9 years. And this, according to research at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, can lead to sexual dysfunction later in life. Researchers have found that men who don't have sex till they have reached their 20s may have trouble getting aroused and having orgasm. No orgasm, no baby, no baby, no peace of mind, and so again, no orgasm. The 'gift' of virginity Add to this the trend of falling sexual desire among married couples, the phenomenon of the 'willing virgin': the Indian male who thinks about sex, is in a committed relationship, but won't go so far as to have intercourse.<query> average age of losing virginity</query> In an interview with the newspaper, Mail Today, 27-year-old advertising copywriter Vipin Vohra professes that he is not ""made for casual sex"". His girlfriend of two years, he say, loves him ""a lot"" and the two have been ""physically intimate"", but they have never had sex. How do you interpret this situation? A man in his prime who has a loving girlfriend in a steady relationship, but is still not tempted to have sex. Generally speaking, Dr Prakash Kothari, noted sexologist and chief of sexual medicine at the King Edward Medical College in Mumbai, sees nothing surprising in such abstinence, calling it an individual's choice. But while he doesn't care much about surveys-""they are like bikinis,"" he says, ""covering the really important bits""-Dr Kothari agrees that Indian men are still in the process of peeling off their layers of inhibition.<query> who is vipin vohra</query> When a man deliberately stays away from sex despite having enough opportunities, something is slightly askew, if not abnormal. Scratch the surface and it becomes visible. The most obvious reason is, of course, the famous Indian discomfort with any mention of sex. This cageyness drills into your mind that like the talk, the act itself might be a little dirty. At a less obvious level, the reason is a personal experience. Take Vohra's case. His notion of staying a virgin till he marries may be romantic, but in fact, it's a sort of reverse rebellion. Vohra, at 21, was invited to a threesome, an invitation he declined. He did have the pleasure- or otherwise-of watching his friends have sex right in front of him, an act supposedly meant to cheer him up, who was then going through a phase of depression.<query> why did sam vohra stay away from sex</query> Instead of making him aroused, the incident made him decide that his first sexual encounter would be with someone special. The irony is, he has now found someone special, but that first encounter is yet to happen. ' Someone special', it seems, is a label reserved for a wife-Vohra and his girlfriend plan to marry soon and virginity will be their 'gift' to each other. Vohra's girlfriend either has a sexual drive and romantic ideas that exactly match his, or she is very respectful of his reluctance. A very high level of acceptance is, in fact, the hallmark of the Indian woman, says Dr Kothari. It's not only single girls who have virgin boyfriends; sometimes wives have to live to with virgin husbands, too. Dr Kothari says he knows a man who got married at 25 but did not have actual sexual intercourse for the next 25 years, ""though they did stimulate each other manually"".<query> who is vohra's girlfriend</query> India, says Dr Kothari, probably has more sexless marriages than any other country. ""There are marriages here that would not last even a few weeks in a Western society."" How much of a man's flagging sex drive is due to his poor body image is anybody's guess, since such things have never been relevant for Indian males. But according to Eli Coleman, academic chair in sexual health at the University of Minnesota Medical School Programme in Human Sexuality, ""there are often dynamics other than the desire to be abstinent until marriage"". The dynamics, says Coleman, include problems with body image, fear of intimacy and alcohol and/or drug abuse. Speaking about virgin young men, Jitendra Nagpal of the Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (VIMHANS) describes it as the Indian man's new sense of responsibility.<query> why do indian men have sex drives</query>"
clueweb12-0605wb-17-00760,2,1,"Which Is Best For You – MacBook Air or iPad? By Charles W. Moore, on January 25th, 2011 AppleMatters’ Bakari Chavanu thinks it would be a good idea for Apple to merge the MacBook Air and the iPad into a single product, but doesn’t expect that to happen anytime soon. I hope never, but it would eliminate the dillemma for those trying to decide which device will be best for their portable computing needs. To help with making that decision, Chavanu and some other members of a MacRumors.com forum about the MacBook Air compileda list of comparitive advantages and disadvantages of the two machines respectively, noting that while there are some commonalities, the big distinction is that the Air runs off the traditional Mac OS X operating system, while the iPad runs on the much more limited iOS (the main reason why I would resist merging the two models).<query> what is the difference between macbook air and ipad</query> Advantages of the iPad cited are its excellence as a content consumption device for reading ebooks, blogs, essays, PDFs, and surfing the Internet, watching movies and TV shows, without the laptop’s attached keyboard getting in the way of good viewing experience. On the other hand, while the iPad is OK for lightweight emailing and note-taking, Chavari says that when writing requirements get longer than a paragraph or two, “it becomes a chore,” and the photo editing experience on the iPad is not so hot either. Back in the positive column the iPad is more portable than the MBA, and its form factor makes it possible to view and read content from nearly any angle. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, is an ideal writing platform, offering much more flexibility in typing and multitasking, the latter capability one of the Air’s Mac OS X enabled major advantages along with the OS X Finder Directory file storage and retrieval system with its traditional desktop and folder structure.<query> what is the difference between a macbook air and an ipad</query> The MacBook Air is also a much better multimedia project and photo editing platform, and of course OS X supports Flash content on teh Air provided you download the Flash application. With iTunes, it’s more of a wash, although you get more storage capacity on the laptop. I don’t disagree with that comparitive analysis, but for my needs, the laptop is the hands-down, no-brainer choice over the tablet. For users who are primarily content consumers, the iPad has a lot to recommend it, but I profoundly hope they remain separate products. MacBook Air: The Best Laptop On The Market Mercury News’s Larry Magid doesn’t equivocate about his admiration for the MacBook Air, declaring it “the best portable PC on the market.” A lot of others evidently think so too, with Apple reporting Mac sales up 23 percent in calendar Q4, 2010 over the same quarter of 2009 — largely on the strength of robust MacBook Air sales — notwithstanding the iPad’s phenomenal popularity bleeding some potential laptop buyers away.<query> which is better laptop or tablet</query> Magid, a onetime avid Mac user, says he drifted over to using mostly Windows for the past two decades, not least because of his strong preference for lightweight laptops. However, after borrowing both 11-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs from Apple and wringing them out, he’s decided to come back to the Mac and buy the 11-inch Air, noting that while it’s much more expensive than an iPad, the real keyboard, slightly larger display and two USB ports, plus the ability to play Flash video and support external monitors tip the value scales in the laptop’s favor. He also reports that switching back and forth between the Mac notebook and the Windows desktop machine he uses in his home office is much less of an issue now that there are so many cross-platform open-source and “Cloud” applications and the cross-platform qualities of Microsoft Office, plus third-party Parallels Desktop which lets the Air run Windows as a “virtual machine.” I can’t disagree with Larry Magid about the MacBook Air now being the best laptop on the market for most users, it’s only real competiton (in my estimation) being the 13″ MacBook Pro. iPad Can Halve Cost of Portable Computing?<query> what is the best laptop</query> Well, Not Quite The Street’s Jonathan Blum maintains that With a bit of aftermarket TLC, the ($499 Apple iPad 16GB really can be tricked into becoming a legitimate portable workstation, although it will entail considerable initial effort, but if you do it right Blum maintains that the iPad has “a heck of a small-business upside,” and does it all for about half the cost of any other Apple portable computing solution. Doing it right includes: • Getting a hard-QWERTY keyboard (which will add some $70 – $100 to your up-front price) • Invest in some software from the App Store at typically $5 a pop • Remembering what iPad cannot do, and that you only have 16GB of storage, and as much functionality as you can get with third-party keyboards and apps for the iPad, you’ll still miss your Mac when it comes to serious data entry or creating complex files.<query> how much does an ipad cost</query> For a detailed tutorial on how to proceed, visit: http://bit.ly/eFiXDW Hmmm; personally, I’d be inclined to just buy a used or refurbished MacBook, or if portability is a marquee requirement, cough up the $300 or so extra (bottom line) capital outlay, get a 11.6” MacBook Air, and save myself a bagfull of hassle and frustration.

Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

The recent lowering of prices of thin displays - same as laptops - have made the desktop even more attractive. A particular 'brand' is not terribly important, but name brands like Dell, Gateway, HP will work fine. Ispecifically don't mention Compaq because my prejudice against them goes back to their very first computer - a real 'piece of shit'.

The program requires a desktop or portable computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows NT or Windows 2000, Vista 32 & 64 bit, Windows 7 32 and 64 bit. or later versions of each. An800 x 600 or higher resolution display is highly recommended, thought a 640 x 480 display will work fine. A color display will also help. The program is about 1.18 mb bytes large and produces log data files that consumes about 65K bytes per month per driver.<query> what is the minimum requirement for ddl</query> A computer with a hard disk is recommended, but the program will install onto a 1.44 Megabyte diskette. Just barely. Get a laptop with a hard drive. Printers - A common requirement for the OTR driver, who is away from home for days and weeks, is a printer to print logs for DOT inspectors. I prefer inexpensive laser printers instead of portable inkjet printers. The inkjet ink is too expensive, and for the price of $350 for a portable inkjet, you can buy an inexpensive HP or Brother or similar laser - only prints black and white. Requires 120v AC so you may need an 12vDC to 120vAC inverter - modern trucks usually already have one for microwaves, refrigerators, TVs, etc. Lasers are bigger but more reliable and cheaper to run - toners and drums will yield 1000's of copies before replacement. Unless you need color printing, consider a laser printer.<query> what kind of printer do i need for otr</query> Laptop problems - The laptop displays will 'wash out' when used in sunlight or even in shadows outdoors when the sun is out. You need to 'hide in the truck or indoors' when using laptops. Even brightest (TFT technology) displays have this problem. The other problem is reliability of laptops in bouncing trucks. I am on my third hard drive since 1998. Fortunately the price of replacements has dropped from $400 to less then $100 for 4 to 10 Gig laptop hard drives. Other drivers report no problems. Your 'mileage' will vary, and I don't think a particular 'brand' is any better than any other when reliability is concerned. Do PLEASE backup vital files like DDL log files to diskette often - I do it every day. I am paranoid, and I speak from experience. As the computer 'Geeks' say: 'It is not a question of if a hard disk will fail, but only when a hard disk will fail.'<query> how much does it cost to replace a hard drive</query> So, what should you look for? 1. The bare minimum . ; A refurbished laptop - Intel CPU 486 25Mhz or better - running Windows 95 with a hard disk drive - 100 Meg (not Gigs) and a diskette drive is the minimum. These can be purchased for $100 to $200. Try before you buy, by installing DDL and another software you wish to run. It will be kind of slow, but adequate for the budget. Screen display about 10 to 12 inches on the diagonal. DOT inspectors at scale houses have been very receptive to logs displayed on laptop screens, as long as the 'vitals' - grid, remarks, recap, etc. - are displayed in 'classic' format. 2. The internet capable. Look for a built in modem (56K bits/sec is normal now) or PCMCIA modem card. Also look for a CDROM (CD reader) so you can install larger applications - word processing, spread sheets, business financials. CPU's Intel or AMD 100Mhz or better is expected. 1 Gig to 3 Gig hard drives are normal and the price $200 to $400.<query> what is the minimum cost of a laptop</query> 3. The cost is no object. The 'dream machine' is the Dell Inspiration 8500 fully rigged with 1.7 Ghz Pentium 4-M, built in CDRW, etc. etc. etc. etc. Will run about $2300 to $3300 (2002 prices). This is considered the 'Cadillac' of laptops. Toshiba models are also being considered. Oh.. I like the 'eraser head' mouse mover instead of the 'touch pad', since I am a 'touch typist'. I don't like moving my hands to the touch pad. The eraser head is in the middle of the keyboard - IBM, HP, Dell, Toshiba models have this. My Winbook has it, but newer models do not have eraser heads so Winbook is not being considered. 4. Logical new laptop. Prices for quite capable laptops have fallen below $1000. 2.0 Gig Intel Celeron processors are offered and are quite satisfactory for all applications (especially DDL) except for the most demanding graphics or gaming applications.<query> what is the price of a laptop</query> Then the Intel Pentium 4 might be considered, but the prices then jump to $1500 or more. Expect a CDRW drive but a 3.5 Inch diskette drive is probably not going to be included. 17 Jun 2002 - update to my laptop situation: My Winbook XL 233 died a few weeks ago. I replaced it a few days ago with a KDS 671DP laptop - very nice (see 05 Jul 2002 update below) - PIII 1Ghz (not M probably why the price is so good), 256Meg ram, 20gig hard drive, 8x DVD, modem and LAN, 14.1 TFT display, and Win XP Pro - and the MicroCenterwww.microcenter.com was 'blowing them out' for $899 = $975 ($20 shipping) delivered including PA sales tax. Not quite the latest and greatest but the price was hard to beat for a very nice machine.<query> how much does a winbook cost</query> A friend has an older version of KDS laptop, and it has worked well for him. KDS is better known for their display monitors - I have 3 of them. Getting used to the 'touch pad' whereas I would have preferred an 'eraser head' mouse mover. But with proper Synaptic driver software, the touch pad is fine. Had to download, from the Synaptic site, proper drivers for touch pad. 05 Jul 2002 - update to update. KDS has announced that they are getting out of the notebook business. Thus KDS might not be such a good buy after all unless price is everything. Mine still works great, and has a one year warranty. Hopefully I don't have to 'invoke' it before the year runs out. Hopefully it will last as long as the Winbook did (3+ years).<query> is kds a good laptop</query> 01 Oct 2002 - The new KDS laptop had problems with frequent 'blue screens of death' and had boot up problems. Calling KDS was not quite the help I had expected. 'Run the 'Restore to Factory Settings' CD and call us in the morning.' ; I presumed, based on past experience with my old Winbook laptop, that the problem was a intermittent cable or something attached to the hard drive. Finally figured out how to 'get into laptop' to the hard drive. Pop the display hinge covers off, remove the panel just in front of the display, remove 2 screws and lift the keyboard up and out, and viola - the hard drive is there on the left side. Tightened some screws which 'holds' the drive's electrical connectors to the 'motherboard' (no 'father board' in this computer), and the problems have vanished. Windows XP is finally going to get Microsoft some respect in the computer world.<query> how to get hard drive out of laptop</query>"

In fact, the term “laptop” is really very generic. There are currently four main styles of these portable PCs, each offering something a bit different, depending upon your specific needs.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a notebook</query> Ultralights – Also known as sub-notebooks or ultraportables, this style of laptop weighs up to – but no more than – four pounds, making them ideal for travelers. The upside of an ultralight is that it doesn’t burden those who have to spend a lot of time carrying them with aching muscles, as its larger cousins often do. The downside, however, is that – in order to cut down on the size and weight – this type of laptop is so small that there’s no room for a network card or internal CD drive. In order to reap the benefits of these types of “attachments,” you’d have to bring an external CD drive and port replicator. Another negative in the scenario is that ultralights tend to be on the expensive end of the laptop spectrum.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and an ultralight</query> Notebooks – This is basically just a regular laptop, but is slightly less heavy, weighing in at four to six pounds. While it’s heavier than the smaller ultralight, it also offers more options with less fuss. Offering the flexibility of a combo bay, notebooks are designed with a large opening on the side which allows the user to plug a CD drive, floppy disk or extra battery – allowing you to access the features that you need without the burden of making room for those that aren’t needed. Standards – Commonly referred to as “regular laptops,” these weigh between six and eight pounds and offer a full range of benefits. This technological pack-mule is the best buy – dollar for dollar – when you consider the cost/performance ratio. Due to their popularity, combined with their design and usability, it’s not uncommon to find discounts on these from major manufacturers.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a combo laptop</query> Other types of laptops, which fall into more specialized categories, tend to be in the higher price ranges. The bottom line is, of the four main types of laptops, the standard is the most economical for the most reasonable amount of money. Extra Large – Although this type of laptop doesn’t yet have a technical name, it’s best to simply refer to it as “extra large,” since they weigh between eight and ten pounds and have a screen that measures at least 17 inches. In addition, the keyboard is much larger than a standard laptop, making it a more comfortable fit for those who find the keyboard of the standard laptop rather inhibitive. There are a couple of downfalls to owning this type of unit, not the least of which includes its weight. There can be a four pound difference between the weight of a standard and an extra large laptop – and that’s quite a bit, when you think about lugging it around all day.<query> what is the difference between a standard laptop and an extra large laptop</query> The other negative factor is the cost of this type of laptop. It offers a price tag that’s every bit as hefty as its weight and size. The purchase of a laptop comes down to personal preference, and there are enough styles in the laptop community to please just about everyone. For those who can’t decide and just want “a laptop,” then it’s probably better to stick to the standard model. This article was published on Monday 15 February, 2010.

My screen was damaged because something fell on it during a plane ride so I called ASUS support to get it fixed. The rep took care of things quickly.

Again, this is pretty much dependent on how well the alternatives are, if ASUS has localized support or even European call centers that would be preferable. Considering your price range though, I'm hard pressed to think of a Dell laptop that comes close to the $3000 price range, apart from Alienware, but you already know my feelings on that. Themost important aspect of any gaming specific laptop is the GPU, as games nowadays are still very GPU intensive. For example even a recent game like Skyrim only uses 2 cores on your CPU and 2 gigs of RAM. __________________ 0 mattatmac View Public Profile Send a private message to mattatmac Find More Posts by mattatmac Arcade Awards mattatmac has no awards.<query> what is the most important thing about a laptop</query> Banners keep MI going!

I would go for in-store 'tops, etc rather than shopping via an official brand website. Employees at comptuer stores usually have better and more intuitive grasps at what kind of computers are great and which are crap right out of the box. As an example, I bought a random asus at... staples(?) for around 650 and experienced a ton of issues until I got settled into it and solved the problems myself.. (issues with the function keys, wireless adapter, stability, freezing, etc).<query> what is the best laptop to buy</query> Only reason I bought via staples was because I had a store credit with them. Buy from canada computers, tiger direct, summit, etc to get the best deal for your (parent's?) buck. If you have a specific graphic card in mind, bring the specs with you when you go to shop, and if you're not entirely sure, impress on them you want to make sure you can get a computer that has good customizabilty (ability to swap out for better ram, ddr2/ddr3, motherboard thats compatible with a wider range of graphics cards, etc). I wouldn't advise buying anything over 1k$, because chances are you'll want to replace it before then. Also research what kind of specs you want, and build a few custom computers on sites that allow you to do so to to get a feel for specs vs price.<query> where can i buy a computer</query> System requirements lab is a good place to go to see what you need to run various types of games.

For example, on a desktop, if you've got 4GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, then you have exactly what it sounds like. If you have a laptop with 4GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, you might get the same thing, or you might end up with 3GB of usable RAM and 1GB dedicated to graphics. So first of all, you have less system memory. Second, system memory is a lot slower for your graphics processor to access than dedicated graphics memory. 0 Andrew A View Public Profile Send a private message to Andrew A Find More Posts by Andrew A Arcade Awards Andrew A has no awards. 12-16-2011 at 07:49 PM #15 AdelaisAer Legendary Survivor Real name: Ammi Program: Multimedia Year: Second Residence: SOCS!<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a desktop</query> Join Date: Sep 2010 Posts: 685 Thanked: 19 Times Liked: 118 Times Quote: Originally Posted byZSimon ASUS ROG class.

Comparing professional digital camera With this concept in mind, selecting the perfect digital camerato suit your needs has just gone from a Saturday afternoon in an electronics store to an extensive research campaign. With your primary objective in mind - to identify and price-shop so you get the mostcamera for your bucks – you'll want to make achecklist of the most important features to you as a professional or a "" prosumer,"" that is, an amateur possessing adequate skills to require a product with some level of professional featuresand functioning. Before you pin down and purchase any particular product, consider the following camera features and their importance to you. To best gauge all the possible matches, you may wish to create a comparative chart that evaluates the special features of each camera.<query> what is the most important feature of a digital camera</query> - Megapixels - Optical zoom - Digital zoom - Point-and-shoot functionality - Presets for landscape, portrait, sports photography, etc. - Other modes – Can you take movies? - Shutter speed - Start-up time - Flash sync - Color and white balance settings - LCD monitor size and settings - Power settings – Does it operate on rechargeable batteries? - And of course, price! Once you've become acquainted with the major features of a professional level digital camera and decided upon your budget, you can then begin researching particular brands and models. As an example, the Canon EOS 20D is a great match for professionals and for advanced amateurs alike. This technical device incorporates interchangeable lenses and 8.2 megapixels, making a ""bad picture"" almost impossible to take.<query> what is the best digital camera for professional use</query> Rivaling the Canon EOS 20D is the Nikon D70. This camera also features interchangeable lenses and 6.1 megapixels, also providing excellent clarity and detail. While these two cameras offer a wealth of handy features, a number of other models will also offer professional photographers and camera enthusiasts a nice array of utilities. Look into reputable brands, compile a checklist of your most critical features and speak with others who have professional cameras, even if it means visiting a chat room, message board or forum. Before you pay for your new toy, demand a chance to test it out, even if that means window-shopping for a little while. You can often test a camera inside the store and then purchase it online for a better deal if you shop smartly. With this in mind, you will definitely want to be comfortable with the camera prior to purchase, thus avoiding any inconveniences involved with returning or exchanging it for another model.<query> what is the best camera for professional photographers</query> Most importantly, do your homework and take your time.

Each lens is dominated by a wide rubberized manual zoom ring. There are marked detent positions for specific focal lengths, but there is no manual focus – that’s done in-camera. Nikon created a new Stepping Drive Motor for the CX mount, and it’s quite silent – very comparable to the full-ring motor Silent Wave on the F-mount. While the lenses have Vibration Reduction, there are no external controls – it’s all controlled in the camera by accessing a specific menu. Interestingly, there are no options to turn off VR, it’s on by default. Finally, each lens has a large button on the zoom ring – the zooms must be released from their most compact carry position in order to work correctly.<query> what is the zoom ring on a nikon camera</query> By doing so, the camera also automatically powers up. The reverse is not true – collapsing the lenses back to carry position is simply that. You’ll have to power down manually using the ON/OFF switch. Despite not having a dedicated EVF, the J1’s rear display was more than adequate to the task when composing, viewing and manipulating the camera. The display did not wash out easily, exhibited sharp and vibrant images, and had a very generous viewing angle. However the display is a drain on your battery life. With a CIPA rating of about 230 shots, the enthusiast user is going to need, not want, a second battery for maximum shoot time in the field. The lenses zoom rather smoothly, and there are no hitches or rough spots encountered. The hood on the telezoom is effective, and serves as secondary protection.<query> how many shots does a tele zoom camera take</query> Both lenses were easy to mount and dis-mount; the small size and weight complemented theNikon J1 quite nicely; it was difficult to tell at times which lens was on from a visual inspection – they’re that small and unobtrusive. The camera’s dearth of external controls has been the subject of much discussion since the 1 Series debuted. In particular, the lack of a true Function button, which could be reassigned to an often manipulated control such as ISO or White Balance, as well as an equivalent “Recent Settings” menu, would go a long way to addressing some of the concerns. In addition, the inability to disable Auto-Review of the last taken image does hamper the “flow” of shooting photos in the field. It remains to be seen if Nikon will address those changes in a future firmware revision.<query> what is the function button on a nikon camera</query> Performance In a single word – excellent. With some caveats covered below. Let’s talk about the focus capability first. There is no menu or external control to invoke Phase-Detect versus Contrast-Detect. The camera evaluates the ambient light values in the frame and decides accordingly. That “threshold” is difficult to quantify in a field-review, but you can easily tell when you’re in PD – especially if you chose Auto-Area AF – the rectangles light up and subjects immediately jump into focus – no hesitation. In fact, it felt very much like the Nikon D3100’s AutoArea AF performance. That’s not to say you’ll be replacing your D3 with this camera anytime soon – but the claim of DSLR-like focus performance is true. As light levels drop, the camera will switch to more traditional CD, which has the familiar one-step “stutter” at the end of the focusing operation to confirm the subject lock.<query> what is the focus of a nikon d3100</query> Nikon’s implementation of PD directly on-sensor is a promising innovation, and hopefully will be seen in future offerings from other makers as well. The PD is nicely complemented by a 73-point AF system – providing effective and wide coverage of the viewfinder area. You’ll be hard pressed to find a section not covered by an AF point. The CD gives you even more, with a 135-point coverage pattern. The subject really needs to have contrast under the AF point to optimize the lock-on, but overall the experience is like no other – I had the opportunity to let several other enthusiast and commercial shooters try out the camera briefly during a day-long road trip – they were all quite impressed and noted how the AF system made the camera feel very responsive for casual shooting.<query> what is af point on nikon cd</query> On the image quality side, theNikon J1 does not disappoint. Shots of the Provincetown harbor and other Cape Cod landmarks, in both rain and blue sky all reflect the color, contrast and sharpness typical of Nikon products and image processing. The Providence skyline exhibited good detail and excellent metering response, with no blowouts and good shadow detail. Colorful boats in P-Town harbor following a brief rainstorm. Nauset Light shrouded in a fast-moving storm front. Elevated perspective of the East Side, Providence R.I. Telephoto shot at 110mm max zoom (300mm equiv.) As a compact camera, theNikon J1 shines in terms of portability and convenience. With two zooms covering the most common focal lengths of 27-300mm and exhibiting a very low-profile, it was easy to pull the camera in and out of a jacket pocket for grab shots or to quickly swap lenses.<query> what is the zoom of nikon j1</query> From the forest pines of Rayce Point to the narrow alleys and beachfronts of Provincetown, it was easy to carry and yet the camera delivered some amazing wide-angles, zoom shots and close-ups. (Some samples thanks to Thomas P. Sisto) On the trail with fellow shutterbugs! Fungus close-ups from the forest floor. Monuments in the mist… Some “found” artwork patterns in a back alley… The beach at low tide… One of the advantages of ILCs is the lack of a mirror box assembly. The slap of the mirror system degrades the stability of certain exposures close to the hand-held shutter speed “danger zone.” Without that mirror challenge, your ability to hand-hold inside the zone goes up accordingly. While some of these shots lack any artistic or inspirational value, the first two frames below were at 1/4th and 1/5th respectively.<query> what is the advantage of ilc camera</query> Without VR, these types of photos would be impossible to obtain. Again, it was easy to keep theNikon J1 close at hand and keep an eye out for near-dusk and after-dark compositions. Low light Example 1 Low light Example 2 The “Superman Building” near Kennedy Plaza The Providence Statehouse at dusk Indoors, the camera’s limiting factor is based upon the CX lenses available now. The 10mm f2.8 pancake prime is a good start, but really isn’t that fast when talking about ambient light photography. In addition, the relatively low 1/60th flash synch ceiling imposes further challenges to action-freezing. The optional FT-1 adapter opens up options by allowing access to a bigger range of F-mount lenses, but the 2.7x crop factor effectively turns even a normal 50mm f1.8 into a mid-tele 135mm.<query> what is the limiting factor of a nikon j1</query> That’s great for portrait and stand-off shooters, not so good for those who prefer to get in close and wide. Despite those factors, the J1 didn’t do too badly in a typically fluorescent-lit karate studio or a restaurant interior with the slow zooms. The noise is noticeable but not objectionable, and with some NR post-process, the images can be cleaned up for reasonable size reproductions, web use or conversion to B&W. Karate studio work using the 30-110 Waiting for my breakfast! Caveats So what are the downsides? As a first-generation product, theNikon 1 Series does deliver on innovations such as PD on-sensor, as well as living up to the image quality one expects from the brand. However, it’s not that simple a proposition. Based on the design and features, the target audience is clearly the average compact P&S owner wanting to move up-tier, gaining more capability and access to interchangeable lenses.<query> what is the downside of the nikon j1</query> In that regard, the camera is a clear success. The tougher proposition is for the enthusiast - such as readers of SeriousCompacts.com. That market segment is not going to be fully satisfied by the current iteration of the 1 Series. TheNikon V1 would appeal more to the enthusiast crowd because of the integral EVF, but both models are constrained by a dearth of manual controls and limited lens system choices. That being said, this author and other photographers who had the opportunity to use the camera over the course of the evaluation all agree that if your type of photography lets you select a particular shooting mode and metering choice; the camera doesn’t get in the way. In fact, it was a liberating experience to just pay attention to the more artistic aspects of taking photos – the timing, the framing, the composition, etc.<query> what is the nikon v1 camera</query> LinkBack URL About LinkBacks Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page… Subscribe to this Thread… Search Thread Advanced Search Display Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode 03-05-2012, 06:34 PM #1 Covey22 New Member Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 2 Nikon J1 Review: A Field Report By Armando J. Heredia The Nikon 1 Series represents the long-awaited entry of a popular DSLR manufacturer into the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (ILC) market. TheNikon J1 model is the more consumer oriented version, and shares many common components and operating features with its enthusiast sibling, theNikon V1. The 1 Series stands out from the rapidly growing crowd of ILCs by a new sensor and hybrid AF system. Instead of iterating an APS-C body, Nikon chose to create a new sensor size and corresponding lens mount, an unexpected move to be sure.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> – the J1 took care of everything else. The PD AF system facilitated making the camera feel very responsive from shot-to-shot. But if you are a “fiddler” or enjoy complete and convenient access to all your camera’s controls, well, it’s going to be a tough sell. The relative lack of choices in lenses is simply a matter of time. Nikon will continue to iterate new CX mount optics, but the historic track record of times between releases doesn’t point to a quick rollout. Despite Nikon’s fine reputation for TTL flash, the onboard unit of the J1 doesn’t tie back into the larger CLS wireless system used by the DSLR product family. It’s a simple flash, period. Finally, there’s the price. At the USD599 starting point, theNikon J1 starts to bump up against the established lines at Olympus, Panasonic and Sony.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> The other manufacturers, by virtue of a head-start, enjoy advantages in price tiering, completeness of systems (i.e., lenses and accessory choices) and market penetration. At USD499, this could be a better seller. Conclusion As part of Nikon’s opening shot to the ILC market, theNikon J1 delivers on capability and performance. The Hybrid AF system really works, and the camera itself continues to live up to the manufacturer’s well-earned reputation as a leading provider of imaging technology. For compact users who are interested in moving up to a faster, higher performing camera and the potential of a larger imaging system (lenses and accessories); the J1 will satisfy. For enthusiast users, well, the only thing this author can recommend is to get down to a retail store and handle it for yourself.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> You may or may not find the dearth of controls to be inhibiting. From a cost perspective, this is where the rubber hits the road. The J1 is a first-generation model, and as such, early technology adopters have always paid a price – whether it was limited functionality, higher acquisition cost or both – to be first in line. With that philosophy, TheNikon 1 Series is priced accordingly – certainly not sky-high outrageous, but definitely not aiming to take market share based on competitive pricing. As such, buyers in general need to take a good hard look at the state of the market. The upside is that you’ll own one of the fastest and certainly one of the most innovative cameras today. The challenges will be to wait out the inevitable delay as more lenses and accessories become available, and seeing if changes in handling will occur through a firmware update.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> Overall, it’s a mixed recommendation – the Nikon J1 is great camera, but you’ll be paying a premium to have one.

She had a shocking pink 'J1' around her neck which, for some strange reason, she assumed I might like but I quickly put her straight on that!<query> what camera is used for slr</query> I spent a few minutes discussing cameras with her and pointed out that the 'V1' is a superbly designed camera which handles nicely, is unobtrusive, and 'designed' rather than styled like most of the others,...however, it is shot in it's foot by tiny sensor and MASSIVE over price being a staggering £700 here in the UK.... If I have my rate of exchange right thats about TWICE the US price!! I pointed out to her that, were nikon to make a similar camera with APS-C sensor and sensible (read; competitive) price then thye would have a showstopper on their hands. I, for one, would/will immediately change from my Sony NEX,... but as things stand why pay more for an inferior system in the same size package? I should add that the 'V1' is better designed and nicer in the hand than Sony NEX models but my minumum requirement is the APS-C sensor with 20x16 inch prints without any 'texture'...which my NEX 3 is well able to do.<query> what is the difference between nikon v1 and nex</query> ........ I don't really 'get it',....don't nikon do any market survey analysis?...or even take a look at what Sony is making? Last edited by Bugleone; 03-06-2012 at 04:11 AM.

The design choice to produce only a 10MP resolving sensor is daring. Only four native lenses currently exist for the camera – a 10mm f2.8 pancake prime (equivalent 27mm), and two consumer-grade zooms, a 10-30mm f3.5-5.6 (equivalent 27-81mm), a 30-110mm f3.8-5.6 ED (equivalent 81-297mm) telephoto and a 10-110 mm f4.5-5.6 ED (equivalent 27-297mm) superzoom with a new silent Power Drive. The latter three lenses are equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR). The feature that received the most hype at pre-launch is the hybrid AF system – Nikon was able to integrate faster-focusing Phase Detect (PD) sensors directly upon the CX imaging chip.<query> what is the nikon cx sensor</query> ( 1 2) Going cold on the E-M5 - looking at a G3.

In lower light, the 1 Series would fall back to more traditional Contrast Detect (CD) sensors which are slower but more reliable in determining subject distance. The Nikon J1 also has some consumer-oriented and value-add features such as Motion Snapshot, which combines brief video and a still of the “decisive moment;” 1080P movie capture and slow-motion video (thanks to a high frame rate continuous mode). This review evaluated the camera’s still-photography features and has scoped out video functions accordingly. Initial Impressions The size of theNikon J1 is deceiving – at first glance, it’s no bigger than most of the lower-tier Coolpix P&S models that it displaces in the Nikon product family.<query> what is the nikon j1 camera</query> The J1 body is no larger in size than a typical compact P&S such as the Coolpix L22 As befitting the consumer tier, theNikon J1 comes in a variety of colors – our evaluation model came in metallic silver with matching two-tone 10-30mm and 30-100 mm zooms. Oddly, the telephoto had a lens hood, but the short zoom did not. There are dedicated hoods for all the native lenses except for the 10mm prime. The hoods can be reverse mounted for storage and both lenses have the latest Nikon “pinch-cap” versions for easy removal. Overall, the footprint occupied by the 1 Series and the two kit lenses is relatively small. It’s not the smallest ILC in the market, but it’s quite portable even in the two-kit form. The J1 with built-in flash deployed and the 30-110’s hood mounted.<query> what is the smallest nikon lens</query> The 1 Series can best be described as “pocketable,” though you’d need a large coat pocket or a modest purse or bag. Nonetheless, when compared to the smallest Nikon DSLR currently in the market – a D3100 – you immediately get a sense of the J1’s possibilities as a “carry everywhere” unit. Note the DSLR is sporting one of the smallest lenses possible – a 50mm f1.8 prime. The J1 still retains the general advantage of a larger, albeit slower zoom. The Nikon J1 next to its larger cousin the Nikon D3100 – the smaller camera is positively svelte. The front is mostly utilitarian – a large lens release button, a mostly bare gripping area on the right side (which has handling implications) , a pair of microphone inputs above the lens mount, a white-light AF assist and an IR input window round out the left the side.<query> what is the smallest nikon camera</query> While the lenses mount and dismount in the same direction as the F-mount, veteran Nikon users will be slightly put out by the need to align the lens using the large dash mounted at 12:00 rather than the more traditional 2:00 position. The rear is dominated by the large 3” display rated at 460K dots resolution, so the output can be a bit course at times. A small switch on the upper left activates the pop-up flash, which is deployed on a rather long and spindly support arm. On the right rear, you’ll find all the controls clustered together – a dedicated Function button, a vertical toggle that doubles as a command dial and zoom, and four buttons – Display, Play, Delete and Menu surrounding a combination control circular dial and a centered OK button.<query> what is the flash button on the nikon f-mount</query> Inside of the circle is the traditional four-way controller, which is marked for specific shortcuts such AE-L/AF-L, self-timer, flash mode and Exposure Compensation. To the right of the bottom plate is the combination hatch leading to the battery and SD/SDHC/SDXC compartment. The tripod mount is wisely aligned with the lens axis. The rear view of the J1. Overall, the feel of the camera is hefty, thanks to the mostly aluminum build, but a lot of the rear fascia is plastic. Nonetheless, there are no creaks and groans – everything is quite solid and well-assembled. Handling After a few minutes use, one of the gotchas of the 1 Series becomes apparent – it’s smooth yet striking industrial design exterior lacks any gripping areas for positive handholding.<query> what is the j1 camera</query> The more expensiveV1 features a minimal vertical “bar” on the right front that acts a friction point for your forefingers, but the J1 is completely bare in this regard. Nikon sells a dedicated GR-N2000 add-on handle, but it’s hard to take seriously at almost USD70 street. Several third party grips have become available at half the cost, and seem to do a much better job. The rear is a bit tight on grip space as well, as there is a small padded area available for your thumb right next to the mode dial, but should have been placed just a little bit higher for more optimal fit. Your other hand will likely be occupied supporting under the bottom plate and the mounted manual zoom lens. That’s not to say you can’t do the “one-hand” shooting style with this camera; it’s just that you won’t be doing it that often.<query> what is the nikon j1</query>"

While camera’s like the Canon 1D X and the Nikon D4 went down in resolution, the D800 tripled it. Traditional thought told those of us in the industry that it would be impossible to maintain speed and ISO performance with such a huge increase in resolution. Nikon answered with the Expeed 3 processor. The same processor that allows the 1 Series cameras to shoot 10 frames per second, and maintain such good high ISO image quality with a smaller than expected sensor size, is what allows a camera like the D800 to exist. Without Expeed 3, the D800 would look very different. By choosing a 36 megapixel sensor for the D800, Nikon has eliminated, or at the very least redefined, the view of resolution they have held since the early days of DSLR’s. This is huge. Up until now, resolution has taken a back seat to improvements in dynamic range, high ISO performance, and speed. Other manufacturers seem to have abandoned the “resolution race” and have started to concentrat on these areas with newer cameras. And while many may argue that these are areas where we would like to see continued improvements, there were likely few who thought they NEEDED such huge files. However, based on initial statements from Nikon, it seems that with the D800, we will be able to have our cake and eat it too. New processor and sensor technologies now available are allowing massive increases in resolution from the D700, without having to sacrifice dynamic range, any high ISO performance, and very little speed. We obviously won’t be able to enjoy improvements at super high ISO’s like we’ve come to expect with a new camera, but not taking a step back with this much resolution is quite amazing.<query> what is the resolution of nikon d800</query> I have to say, the announcement of the D800 is bittersweet for me. I would have loved to have been right about the camera being lower resolution. Unfortunately, the unpredictable nature of rumors didn’t lean my direction this time. But while everyone is caught up with the massive resolution, I find myself continually asking what this shift in ideology means long term for Nikon. Don’t underestimate this change in their corporate philosophy. I think this is the first of many incredibly revolutionary products from Nikon, products that we never would have imagined we would see from them. They’ve just thrown caution to the wind and introduced a product that a year ago people would have expected of Canon, not Nikon. I have a feeling that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Of the specs I will say this, the D800 looks like it will be amazing. As many expected, Nikon has added video to the camera, which will make this an enormously popular camera for video shooters and still photographers alike. The newer autofocus and metering systems make an already great system even better, and I am glad to see that Nikon kept the built in flash. If you haven’t taken advantage of the built in flash to trigger off camera speedlites, you need to. It’s an invaluable tool that far too many people overlook. I can’t wait to get my hands on a D800 and see how it performs. For now, I will be doing what I suspect many people lusting after the camera will be doing…buying larger hard drives.<query> what is the nikon d800</query> Until then, Canon, the ball is in your court. About The Author Nick Nick Gilson first realized his passion for photography as a high school student. He worked part time as a photographer and in camera sales through college, and has been working in the industry nearly full time since 2000. In that time, he has grown his skill set with nearly every genre of photography, developing a particular interest in infrared imaging. Nick has been with pictureline since 2004, and has been based at our Draper location since 2009. Liked this page? 3 Responses Mark Bowers 2.8.2012 Thanks Nick for your honest opinion. I have another question. With the Megapixels count going through the roof, I am thinking the sensors are at the edge of the resolving power of the lenses. Are the lenses improving enough to keep up with the super megapixel sensors, or are we just going to get mush on the edges of our huge files?<query> who is nick gilson</query> Reply Nick 2.8.2012 Great question Mark. It’s a question that I’ve been asking as well. As digital cameras have improved over the years we’ve seen first hand just how important the optics are. The most recent generation of cameras resolved well enough that you could detect the flaws in the lenses, particularly on the edges. I think that’s part of the reason we’re seeing Nikon and Canon both introducing new versions of popular lenses that are significantly more expensive. They are both likely anticipating advances in technology where having a top notch lens becomes more of a necessity, rather than a luxury. Only after receiving some of the D800′s will be be able to definitively answer your question, but I suspect that sticking with the Nikkor lenses that are utilizing the Nano Crystal Coating will give the best results. Hopefully we won’t have to wait for too long to find out!<query> which nikon lens is better</query> Mark Bowers 2.9.2012 Well written Nick, Thanks. I will buy D800 when it comes in to replace my D700 (which has been a really great camera for the last 4 years). Reply Leave A Response Click here to cancel reply.

clueweb12-0310wb-29-14261,3,1,"Shun Cheung Date/Time Imprint The D3000 provides a date/time imprint feature that is popular for consumers, but this option is only available if one capturesJPEG only. There is no date imprint inRAW (NEF) images, not even in the JPEG from the RAW + JPEG basic option. The D3000 has an orientation sensor so that the imprint always appears on the lower right corner of the image, regardless of whether the camera is held horizontally or vertically. I even tried to hold the D3000 vertically in two ways, by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise as well as counter-clockwise from the horizontal position, and both vertical images have the date imprint in their respective lower right corner. However, you can neither control the location of the date imprint in the image nor move it in post-processing.<query> what is the date imprint on a d3000</query> Therefore you need to crop the image later on, you can potentially cut into the middle of the imprint and it will look very strange. Lenses With a few exceptions, almost all Nikon F-mount lenses since their introduction in 1959 can be mounted onto the D3000 to capture images, including most pre-AI (Auto Indexing) lenses from before 1977. Recent 2009 statistics show that Nikon has manufactured over 50 million F-mount lenses in the last half century. However, the D3000 can only meter with modern lenses that have a built-inCPU chip to relay aperture opening electronically to the camera body. Essentially all Nikon AF lenses plus a few late manual-focus P lenses have aCPU chip in the lens. Additionally, since the D3000 body has no built-in AF motor, only Nikon AF-S (including the earlier AF-I) and equivalent third-party lenses that have an in-lens AF motor can auto focus with the D3000.<query> what type of lens does nikon d3000 use</query> Other AF and AF-D lenses that have no motor become manual-focus only on the D3000. Shun Cheung In the US, the D3000 is only available as a kit with the 18-55mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR lens; you cannot purchase the D3000 body only. Optically this lens is good and the vibration reduction (VR) feature is a great help. The maximum aperture f5.6 on the long end is on the slow side so that a flash is pretty much required for any indoor photography. The construction is typical consumer grade with a plastic lens mount. There is no distance scale on the lens, and unlike higher-end AF-S lenses, you cannot manually override the (auto) focus when the lens is set to A (auto focus). You must manually set the lens to M (manual focus) first and the focusing ring on the front end of the lens is quite narrow.<query> what is the maximum aperture of a d3000 lens</query> For indoor work, Nikon now has a very affordable 35mm/f1.8 AF-S DX lens that is highly popular among consumerDSLR users. It is a fast lens that is small in size. The mostly plastic construction is adequate and its lens mount is metal. Its AF can be overridden manually without switching to manual focus. The main disadvantage is that it has a moderate amount of color fringing (chromatic aberration). For telephoto lenses, Nikon has an affordable 55-200mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR which is good optically but also on the slow side with a maximum aperture of f5.6 on the long (200mm) end. This lens also has a very consumer-grade plastic mount. Flash Photography The D3000 has a built-in pop-up flash that has limited power, and unlike those on higher-end models such as the D90 and D300/D300s, the D3000’s pop-up flash cannot be the NikonCLS (Creative Lighting System) master flash to control remote slaves.<query> what is the best nikon lens</query> For those who use flash frequently, they are better off with an external flash. The D3000 uses Nikon iTTL flashes such as the SB-400 and SB-600. The SB-400 is a small flash that also has limited power and cannot rotate upward for bounce flash in the vertical orientation. The SB-600 is more power and more versatile; it is larger but is still quite reasonable on the D3000’s hot shoe. There are also the more advanced SB-800 (discontinued) and SB-900 iTTL flashes, but while they are compatible with the D3000, they seem to be way too big for this small camera (especially the SB-900). See our Nikon iTTL Flash Guide for more information on Nikon flashes. Memory Cards and Batteries The D3000 uses SD memory cards and is SD-HC compatible. The D3000 is sold with the new EN-EL9s battery, which is interchangeable with the older EN-EL9.<query> what flash does nikon d3000 use</query> The new EN-EL9a is gray in color and is rated at 1080mAh, so it hold slightly more charge than the older EN-EL9: 1000mAh and black in color. During my testing, I did not use the battery to exhaustion. After some moderate use, including plenty of image review on theLCD, there still seems to be plenty of charge left. Nikon D3000 vs. D5000 Nikon introduced the D5000 a few months before the D3000. The D5000 represents a new class ofDSLR that is still compact but has more features and options similar to the higher-end D90. The D5000 uses a 12MP CMOS sensor and its ISO range is from 200 to 3200. Cameras with that sensor typically have a one-stop advantage over those that use the 10MPCCD sensor on the D3000. My side-by-side test among the D3000, D5000, and D700<query> what is the difference between nikon d5000 and d3000</query> atISO 1600 verifies that difference. (With its 12MP FX-format sensor, the D700 is another stop better than the D5000, and that is also expected.) Additionally, the D5000 has the following extra features over the D3000: Live View Movie Mode Swivel LCD, at a slightly smaller 2.7"" More Custom Settings In summary, the D5000 provides some more advanced features for more serious photographers. For example, if one prefers to captureRAW and JPEG, on the D5000 theJPEG can be of any one of the three qualities available (fine, normal and basic). The D3000 only offersRAW and JPEG basic. The D5000 has a Custom Setting menu that is similar to those on the D3, D700, D300s and D90, although it does not have nearly as many options. The simpler D3000 does not provide that menu.<query> what is the difference between d5000 and d3000</query> One thing to keep in mind is that the movie mode on the D5000 is very basic. It is certainly a nice additional feature to have, but the D5000 is still primarily a still-image camera. Conclusion Nikon has been raising the bar on their entry-level DSLRs. While the D3000 is intended to be their most affordable model, it is using a variation of the 10MP sensor and the same AF module on the D200, which was a $1699 prosumer model that was in very high demand merely a few years ago back in 2006. Meanwhile, the D3000 is conveniently small and light so that it is easy to carry around. The D3000’s small size and affordable price lead to some compromises, mainly the lack of an on-camera AF motor and some dedicated control buttons. Most owners will only use AF-S lenses on the D3000 so that they have both metering and auto focus.<query> what is the nikon d5000</query> Since Nikon now offers quite a few affordable AF-S lenses, this is not a major issue any more. For consumers who are into family, travel and children sports photography and prefer a simpleSLR with more lens selections, this is an excellent camera at a very reasonable price. For the more serious photographers who prefer more controls and user options, the D5000 and especially D90 should be better choices. In the US, currently the D3000 is only available as a kit with the 18-55mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR lens. You cannot purchase a new D3000 body separately. It can be an issue if you already have that particular lens or other standard wide-to-tele zoom and don’t need another one.

Shun Cheung , August 03, 2009; 09:29 P.M. Please keep in mind that this is merely a ""first look"" review, as I have only used the D3000 for a couple of days, and I mainly used it with the 18-55mm VR lens also on loan from Nikon. That is not a lens I own myself, although its limitations are very apparent compared to the f2.8 zooms I typically use. A major issue is that I don't have a RAW converter to open D3000 NEF files yet.<query> is nikon d5000 better than d5000</query> Therefore, so far all the tests are based on JPEF files only. Later on hopefully I'll run a head-to-head comparison against my D200 with the same lenses. Bruno Vieira , August 06, 2009; 03:04 P.M. I believe we should point out that only D40 still have the awesome 1/500s flahs sync speed.... and that's a shame!! I would love if the new cameras also had it.... Vladimir Ferdman , August 06, 2009; 07:32 P.M. Will this camera work well with the older MF lenses? Will it meter, for example with the 50mm/1.8 AI or AIS lens in any of the modes? I think a big drawback to Nikon entry level DSLRs is that while they'll mount and shoot with the legacy glass, they will not meter with it, which makes the whole idea of compatibility of the mount moot.<query> what lens does nikon d40 use</query> This is where Pentax beats Nikon hands down. Most photogs with arsenal of good legacy glass and who love shooting manual focus are left in the dust. I personally don't care if the auto-focus has 3 spots or 300, but will it meter with an old (and REALLY awesome) MF lens? Shun Cheung , August 13, 2009; 05:17 P.M. The 1/500 sec on the D40 is due to its electronic shutter, which is not a good thing to have. That is why Nikon is phasing that out completely. See Joseph Wisniewski's excellent explanation here: http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00SuYs Emil Ems , August 18, 2009; 07:00 P.M. The D5000 introduced an automatic three-exposure feature, with one stop over, one stop under and one normally exposed. Since the dynamic range of the sensor is limited, this is extremely useful in high contrast situations.<query> why does nikon auto focus</query> Does the D3000 offer the same feature? Michael Weick , August 21, 2009; 09:18 A.M. Personally I don't care if an electronic shutter is not a ""good thing"" esp. if Nikon or any other manufacturer will you make believe this to sell more cameras to the uninformed. The D 40 (D50 and D 70) has the 1/500 flash sync. which makes it a more versatile camera than any other camera at the moment during sunny day light. This is better than any D3(X) or whatever. Neil Dwyer , August 31, 2009; 04:49 P.M. Thanks for the review. Very helpful, as I'm preparing to buy a Nikon DSLR & haven't selected the model. Do you know if the d3000 is compatible with a Sigma 28-105, 3.8-5.6 lens? I read that the d40, 50 & 60 won't autofocus with it, but other Nikon DSLRs will.<query> what is the nikon d3000</query> Used that lens with my N65 and would like to on the DSLR if possible. Shun Cheung , September 19, 2009; 12:09 P.M. Among all Nikon digital SLRs introduced to date (September 2009), the D40, D40x, D60, D3000 and D5000 do not have a built-in auto focus motor. Therefore, unless the lens has an AF motor built-in (known as AF-S in Nikon terminology), you will have to focus the lens manually on any one of those cameras. However, the D50 has a built-in AF motor in the camera body. James McConnell , September 22, 2009; 02:11 P.M. Good review for the most part, however: I just purchased the D3000 over the D5000 because, according to the Nikon Site, the D3000 is compatible with the Nikon Creative Lighting System, while the D5000 is not.<query> does nikon d5000 have auto focus</query> It seems the main value of the D5000 over D3000 is it's ability to do movies (rather poorly) and, of course, the ever questionable ""Live View"" feature that is so popular on most pocket cameras. The increase in megapixels doesn't mean that much, as my 6 megapixel D70 far outperformed any 10 to 12 megapixel pocket cameras I've ever seen... Again, Thanks for the review, it helped me decide. Shun Cheung , December 03, 2009; 09:49 A.M. Sorry James, all Nikon DSLRs since the 2003 D2H are compatible with the Creative Lighting System (CLS), including the D5000. Rosco Campbell , January 03, 2010; 09:59 A.M. So much dribble in these camera reviews.... so we need to know the facts on the camera's functions ok fair enough.... but why can't you guys put up a load of pictures taken by the camera with a few details on the side so we can se what it can do...not just 2 or 3 but maybe 10-15 of diffrent shooting modes would be so much welcome....<query> what is the difference between d5000 and d3000</query> Rosco. Peter Neale , September 12, 2010; 07:28 P.M. You have stated that the D3000 will mount most pre-AI lenses, yet the manual states that it will not mount any pre-AI lenses. Can you please clarify. Shun Cheung , September 12, 2010; 07:57 P.M. Peter, I suppose that Nikon officially does not want you to mount any pre-AI lenses onto the D3000, while in fact it works fine. Michael Freeman gave an excellent explanation on the Nikon Forum in the following thread: http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00U513 Peter Neale , September 12, 2010; 09:45 P.M. Ah, thanks very much, Shun, for your prompt response. The thread you have referenced explains it very clearly. I don't yet have a D3000 (it's in the mail) and the only AF bodies I have which fit that category are the older type (D100, F75) with the switch that pushes sideways, not inwards.<query> can i use pre ai lenses on a nikon d3000 But that raises another question, which might belong in a different thread: if the purpose of that mechanism is to tell the body when the lens is on minimum aperture so that the meter will work with the lens and the aperture can be changed by thumb wheel on the body, why is that post present on lenses built long before AF (Ai/Ai-S) when bodies built in the same era (F3, FM, FE, etc) didn't have that switch? Shun Cheung , September 12, 2010; 11:05 P.M. Peter, you need to search about Nikon's ""EE Servo Coupling Post"" and its functionality during the AI/AI-S era, e.g. this article: http://www.zi.ku.dk/personal/lhhansen/photo/EE.htm Please keep in mind that Nikon is discontinuing the D3000; it is now replaced by the D3100:http://photo.net/equipment/nikon/D3100/preview/ Peter Neale , September 13, 2010; 06:49 A.M. Thanks again, Shun, for your prompt and informative answer.<query> why is the servo coupling post present on lenses built long before af</query> Yes, I am aware that the D3000 is about to be superseded by the D3100, but this D3000 is coming to me for an unbeatable price - $0.00.

It remains to be very small and light, convenient for casual photographers. One of the main weaknesses for the D40 and D60 is the Multi-CAM 530 AF module that has only 3 AF points, which do not cover the frame very well. Nikon has solved that problem on the D3000 by applying the higher-end 11-AF-point Multi-CAM 1000 AF module, previously found on the D200, D80, D90, and D5000. The D3000 uses 10MP CCD sensor that is similar to those on the Nikon D200, ( compare prices) (review), Nikon D80, (compare prices) (review), Nikon D60, ( compare prices) (review), and Nikon D40x, (compare prices) (review).<query> what is the nikon d3000</query> Its rated ISO range is from 100 to 1600 with a Hi 1 (ISO 3200) option. Typically, one can expect good highISO results up to one stop below the highest rated ISO (In this case one stop below 1600 isISO 800), and still acceptable results at the maximum (ISO 1600).

I asked my wife and some of her women friends to hold it with the 18-55mm kit lens, including a friend’s 6-year-old daughter, and they all like it very well. However, the grip on the right side of the camera body still has sufficient thickness so that people with larger hands can feel comfortable holding these small cameras. Because of the limited space on the camera, there is only one large 3"" LCD on the back, one command dial, and a few buttons. There is no top LCD to display the frame count, aperture and shutter speed; instead, they are shown on the backLCD as well as inside the viewfinder. On the top right side of the camera, there is a dial for selecting the A, S, P, and M exposure modes and the scene modes (e.g. portrait, landscape, children, sports, macro and night).<query> what is the lcd on a d3000</query> The single command dial controls both the aperture and shutter speed. In other words, the most frequently used controls are still directly available on the camera. A lot of controls that are used less frequently such as memory card formatting,ISO selection and white balance selection are only available as menu options. In a way it is less convenient for the photographer and can slow down the operation, but it seems to be a reasonable compromise for the sake of small size and therefore limlited space on the camera. The D3000 does have one programmable function button. The user has a choice on which frequently used control to assign to that button for faster selection. The D3000 uses separate zoom in and zoom out buttons to control the current image on display. If you keep on pressing onto the zoom out button, it will show the thumbnails of 4, 9, and 72 images; with another press, the D3000 will display a calendar for the current month and shows the thumbnail images captured in each day.<query> what is the function button on a d3000</query> If one keeps a lot of images in the memory cards for a long period, this feature makes it easy to review older images. New 3"" LCD Naturally, the large 3"" LCD dominates the back of the camera, and it is considerably larger than the 2.5"" version on the D40 and D60. As a result, there is not much space for everything else. The Multi-Selection pad is now pushed to the far right and is therefore a bit too close to the edge; it is slightly less convenient but not a major problem. The D3000 3""LCD has 230K dots; it displays a nice image but not as sharp as the 920K-dot version on the high-end D3, D700 and D300/D300s bodies. Nikon D40 vs. D3000 [back] New Guide Mode The D3000 has a new feature called the Guide Mode, which is selectable from the top Exposure Mode/Scene Mode dial.<query> what is the lcd on a nikon d40</query> The Guide Mode has three sections: Shoot View/Delete Set up Essentially it is an on-camera guide on how to set up the camera, e.g. ISO, white balance, file format, etc. and how to capture images either with a shallow depth of field or to freeze motion. In other words, it contains a beginner’s guide that shows you to use a large aperture to blur the background, a shutter speed around 1/200 sec to shop people motion and 1/1000 to stop vehicle motion, etc. It is convenient for early beginners, but once you learn how the aperture, shutter speed, andISO settings affect the image, you can easily decide on those settings yourself. Shun Cheung Auto Focus Since the D3000 uses the same Multi-CAM 1000 AF module as the D200, which I have owned since 2007, I am quite familiar with its strengths and weaknesses.<query> what is the guide mode on a d3000</query> On the D3000, it performs in a similar fashion. For outdoor photography under brightly lit conditions, it is very good. The Group Dynamic option is especially convenient for sports photography. However, indoors under dim light, only the center AF point that is of cross type is highly effective. If you use any one of the other 10 line type AF point, you may experience some AF “hunting” under low light. High-ISO Results Similar to the Nikon D200, D80, D40x, and D60, the 10MP CCD sensor Nikon uses gives good highISO results up to about 800. If there is sufficient light, ISO 1600 is still fair, but under very dim light, the resulting image becomes noisy. You lose about 1 stop of highISO capability compared to the newer 12MP CMOS sensor on the D300/D300s, D90 and D5000.<query> what is the highest iso for nikon d300</query>"

Nikon The Bottom Line I found that writing the Nikon Coolpix P90 review to be one of the most difficult camera reviews I've ever written. The P90 has a lot of nice features, including a 24X optical zoom, a tiltable 3.0-inch LCD, an easy-to-use interface, and a light-weight design that makes it easy to use.<query> what is the nikon coolpix p90</query> Unlike many sub-$400 cameras, you can use a viewfinder or the LCD to frame images. However, the P90's image quality just isn't as good as I'd like to see. It's a nice camera, but it just doesn't seem to have a good classification: It's too expensive for a point and shoot, and it doesn't offer the image quality you'd want in a DSLR. Pros 24X optical zoom is great feature Tiltable LCD is a handy feature Handgrip is very comfortable to use Can use live view or viewfinder to frame photos Very easy to use - contains few buttons Cons Close-up focus should be better Overall image quality should be better LCD can be tough to see in sunlight No possibility of using interchangeable lenses Description Resolution: 12.1 megapixels Optical zoom: 24X (26-624mm) LCD: 3.0-inch, 230,000 pixels (tiltable) Maximum image size: 4000 x 3000 pixels Battery: Li-ion (rechargable) Dimensions: 3.3 x 4.53 x 3.9 inches Weight: 16.2 ounces (body only, no battery, no memory card) Image sensor: CCD 1/2.33 in.<query> what is the zoom of the p90</query> Guide Review - Nikon Coolpix P90 Review Image Quality One of the biggest drawbacks for the Coolpix P90 is its overall image quality. The photos certainly aren't terrible, and most of them are at least average quality. However, low-light photos tend to have stray pixels and purple fringing. It also seemed to have trouble focusing properly on close-up images. The P90 offers 12.1 megapixels of resolution. When shooting at the maximum resolution, you can crop the photo down which can prevent some image-quality problems. The 24X optical zoom lens (26mm-624mm equivalent) can overcome some of the image-quality issues, too. However, if you don't need a extra-large zoom lens, there are better cameras out there in this price range in terms of image quality. Performance The overall speed of the P90 is very good, especially compared to similarly designed and priced cameras.<query> what is the resolution of nikon coolpix p90</query> You can shoot your first photo about 2 seconds after pressing the power button, and itsshot to shot delays are reasonable. The LCD can be tilted for odd-angle photos, which is handy. Measuring 3 inches diagonally, the LCD is large and sharp. However, it could be a little easier to see in bright sunlight. Design The P90's design is interesting. I found it easy to use the P90 one-handed, and its large lens helps balance the camera nicely. The lens also dominates the front panel of this model, giving it a look similar to a DSLR, even though you cannot useinterchangeable lenses with it. For a camera of its size, it's lightweight. It is very easy to use, too, with few buttons. However, it just doesn't seem like the P90 has a good segment in the market.<query> how long does it take to shoot a picture on a p90</query> Its large zoom lens is nice, but I'd almost rather spend a little more for a trueDSLR with more flexible lens options and better image quality. If you don't shoot many close-up photos, and you need the large zoom lens, theNikon P90 can be a good choice, though.

It certainly has plenty of bells and whistles, but is it worth paying extra to buy this flash over the cheaper SB-700? Description Guide Number: 157.5 feet (48m) at ISO 200 Coverage: 17-200mm, 14mm Tilt / Swivel: 360 degrees Recycle Time: 2.3 - 4.5 seconds Illumination Pattern: 3 patterns: Standard, Even, and Center-Weighted Nikon Speedlight SB-900 Flash Review This is Nikon's flagship flashgun, and it has tons of features attached to it.<query> what is the flash size of nikon flash</query> However, it is absolutely huge and will take up a lot of room in your camera bag! You should also be aware that it will only work to full capacity with modern digital cameras. Older camera models (such as the D100, D1, D1X, and D1H) will be limited to manual use. Controls and Batteries The Nikon SB-900 retains the useful controls for accessing exposure compensation, and the battery compartment is well made and solid, with clear instructions on how to insert the batteries. However, the LCD screen is dull, and some numbers can be hard to read as they are so small. There's no battery meter, so batteries can die without warning. But recycling time is fast ... definitely much faster than Nikon's cheaper flashguns. Flash Head The SB-900 covers a remarkable range of 17-200mm, down to 14mm with the wide-angle diffuser.<query> what is the difference between nikon sb-900 and sb-900 However, it should be noted that at 200mm, the SB-900 only gives a 1/3 stop advantage over the 85mm setting of Nikon's old SB-600. So, the great range won't give you a massive amount of extra light and coverage. Like its Canon counterpart, the580EX II, the SB-900's head gives complete 360 degree tilt and swivel coverage, which should leave you with little uncovered. What is the Guide Number? We've talked about how the SB-900 has a guide number of 48m (157.5 feet). But how does this translate in practical terms? The guide number follows this formula: Guide Number / Aperture at ISO 100 = Distance To shoot at f8, we would divide the guide number by the aperture to determine the appropriate distance for the subject: 157.5 feet / f8 = 19.68 feet Therefore, if we are shooting at f8, our subjects shouldn't be further than 19.68 feet away.<query> what is the guide number on a nikon sb-900</query> This is a big distance and should cover most eventualities! However, it is 4 feet less than Canon's 580EX II will cover. Modes and Filters The SB-900 features Nikon's I-TTL flash exposure metering mode which is the automatic mode. It's excellent, as long as you're using a camera that's compatible. The flashgun can also detect if you're using an FX (full frame) or DX (crop frame) camera. There's also auto aperture, manual, distance-priority manual, repeating flash, and non TTL auto modes. The distance-priority manual mode is pretty clever, as you set the aperture and distance of the subject, and the flashgun will work out how much power to use. Manual flash mode can be controlled in 1/3 increments from f1.4 to f90, but it's a shame that it can't go down to f1.2.<query> what is the flash mode on nikon sb-900</query> The SB-900 also comes with two useful filters, one for tungsten lighting and one for fluorescent. These work really well, and they help to produce correctly lit images (with information transmitted to the camera'swhite balance settings). The flash can also automatically detect which filter is in place. Illumination Patterns The SB-900 offers three different illumination patterns: Standard, even, and center-weighted. These essentially try to alter the drop off points of the flash. Even spreads the drop off areas marginally wider than the standard pattern, while center-weighted concentrates the flash into the center of the image. I'm not entirely convinced that they make a huge amount of difference, but there are some subtle alterations to be had. Wireless Mode The Nikon SB-900 works as a master or slave unit, and it works with wireless transmitters.<query> what is the nikon sb-900</query> Using the flash off camera will help to soften the harsh lighting and prevent your pictures from looking flat. In Conclusion The SB-900 is an impressive flashgun, and its accessories (in the shape of the filter kit and a Sto-fen-type diffuser) are much better than those of its rivals. However, unless you shoot a lot of weddings or events, I can't see it being a necessary purchase in comparison to the cheaper SB-700, or even the older SB-600. It's a brilliant flashgun (other than a few slight drawbacks), but it is expensive and heavy. If you need the extra range and features provided by it, though, I would recommend it without hesitation.

Sign Up Discuss in my forum Nikon Coolpix L20 Review About.com Rating 4.5 Star Rating User Rating 2 Star Rating (3 Reviews) Write a review By Kyle Schurman, About.com Guide See More About: camera reviews nikon cameras With a price around $120, the Nikon Coolpix L20 is a great value for beginning photographers. Nikon The Bottom Line Beginning photographers typically look for two things in a point and shoot camera: Ease of use and a great value (meaning a good mix of price and features). Such cameras might not do everything perfectly, but they should outperform others in their price range.<query> what is the price of nikon coolpix</query> My Nikon Coolpix L20 review shows that this point and shoot digital camera fits those two critera almost perfectly. In addition, it features excellent response times. The Coolpix L20 (MSRP: $129) has almost noshutter lag, meaning you rarely miss a spontaneous photo. Nikon has created a very nice, basic, affordable camera for beginners with the L20. Pros Low price makes L20 a great value Very easy to use Camera's response times are very fast compared to others in this price range Easy to hold and shoot with one hand Handles odd lighting conditions very well Cons 3.6X optical zoom could be larger LCD can be difficult to see in bright sunlight Close-up focus could be better Battery life could be better Description Resolution: 10.0 megapixels Optical zoom: 3.6X (38-136mm) LCD: 3.0-inch, 230,000 pixels Maximum image size: 3648 x 2736 pixels Battery: two AA size Dimensions: 2.4 x 3.8 x 1.2 inches Weight: 4.8 ounces (no battery, no memory card) Image sensor: CCD 1/2.33 in.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> Guide Review - Nikon Coolpix L20 Review Image Quality For a budget-priced camera, the Coolpix L20 produces very good image quality, much better than most sub-$150 cameras. The automatic focus, exposure, and shutter speeds are accurate the vast majority of the time, producing sharp, bright photos. The L20 shoots good photos indoors, too, which often is an Achilles' heel of bargain-priced digital cameras. The only major drawback to the Coolpix L20's image quality is in extreme close-up photos, which rarely have sharp focus. The L20 could use a ""document""scene mode. It also would be nice if the L20 had a little more than its 10.0megapixels of resolution, but most beginning photographers will be OK with this model's resolution. Performance The L20's response times are very good, especially for a camera in this price range.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> It starts quickly, and it has a good shot-to-shot response time. The L20 is very easy to use as well. One area where the Coolpix L20 suffers a little bit is in battery life. It runs from two disposable AA batteries, and it seems to run out of battery power more quickly than other AA-powered cameras, probably, in part, because of its large, 3.0-inchLCD. Its overall battery life is below average, especially compared to cameras that run fromproprietary batteries. Design Nikon has created a good-looking camera in the L20, which is available only in deep red. It's a little wider on the right-hand side, which makes it easy to hold and operate one-handed. Had Nikon included a larger optical zoom lens than the 3.6X in the L20, it would've been nice.<query> what is the battery life of a coolpix camera</query> This camera isn't great for shooting nature photos from a distance or sports across a large field. The zoom does work in movie mode, however. The L20 cannot takewide angle photos, unfortunately. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the L20 delivers in the primary areas of importance for beginning photograhers. User Reviews 1 out of 5 Cheaply made, warranty no-good with Nikon, Member HappyShoppers This camera lasted less than 6 months. Downloading pictures, the screen went haywire. It seemed to be an electro problem. The only IMAGE that would display was a cracked screen. The screen itself is not damaged, and there is not even a scratch on the camera. We are very careful with our electronics. We sent it in, as directed, to the Nikon service dept. The service dept wants $99 to fix a camera that is under warranty, and only cost $89 to begin with!<query> what is the warranty on a nikon camera</query> They said the screen is cracked, and the damage was due to a heavy impact. Absolutely not true. We pointed out the perfect condition of the camera body. Their reply? They said it must have been water damage. Again, not true. Nikon is not an upstanding company.

clueweb12-0205wb-63-31022,6,1,"Why is the Ocean Salty? Why is the Ocean Salty? By Herbert Swenson US Geological Survey Publication All water, even rain water, contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call ""salts."" But not all water tastes salty. Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment, and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test. It is one's taste buds that accept one water and reject another. A simple experiment illustrates this. Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet. Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present. Add a pinch of table salt to the second, and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a ""pinch."" But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> The salinity of ocean water varies. It is affected by such factors as melting of ice, inflow of river water, evaporation, rain, snowfall, wind, wave motion, and ocean currents that cause horizontal and vertical mixing of the saltwater. THE SALTIEST WATER... The saltiest water (40 o/oo ) occurs in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, where rates of evaporation are very high. Of the major oceans, the North Atlantic is the saltiest; its salinity averages about 37.9 o/oo. Within the North Atlantic, the saltiest part is the Sargasso Sea, an area of about 2 million square miles, located about 2,000 miles west of the Canary Islands. The Sargasso Sea is set apart from the open ocean by floating brown seaweed ""sargassum"" from which the sea gets its name.<query> what is the saltiest ocean</query> The saltiness of this sea is due in part to the high water temperature (up to 83º F) causing a high rate of evaporation and in part to its remoteness from land; because it is so far from land, it receives no fresh-water inflow. Low salinities occur in polar seas where the salt water is diluted by melting ice and continued precipitation. Partly landlocked seas or coastal inlets that receive substantial runoff from precipitation falling on the land also may have low salinities. The Baltic Sea ranges in salinity from about 5 to 15 o/oo. The salinity of the Black Sea is less than 20 o/oo. Water of the Puget Sound in the Tacoma, Wash., area ranges in salt content from 21 to about 27 o/oo. This area is drained by a number of fresh-water streams which discharge an average of about 4.1 billion gallons of water per day into Puget Sound.<query> what is the salinity of the black sea</query> Salinity of sea water along the coastal areas of the conterminous United States varies with the month of the year as well as with geographic location. For example, the salinity of the ocean water off Miami Beach, Fla., varies from about 34.8 o/oo in October to 36.4 o/oo in May and June, while diagonally across the country, off the coast of Astoria, Oregon, the salinity of sea water varies from 0.3 o/oo in April and May to 2.6 o/oo in October. The water off the coast of Miami Beach has a high salt content because it is undiluted sea water. Off the coast of Astoria, however, the sea water is less saline because it is mixed with the fresh water of the mighty Columbia. Sometimes river water travels far from shore before it mixes with sea water.<query> what is the salinity of ocean water</query> This is shown by data gathered from a study of the Columbia River, which, in an average year, carries to the ocean enough water to cover an area of 1 million acres to a depth of 197 feet. Using a radio- active tracer, scientists at Oregon State University have followed the river's water from its mouth near Astoria to a point southwest of Coos Bay, 217 miles away. The salt content of the open oceans, free from land influences, is rarely less than 33 o/oo and seldom more than 38 o/oo. Throughout the world, the salinity of sea water averages about 35 o/oo. This average salinity was obtained by William Dittmar in 1884 from chemical analyses of 77 sea water samples collected from many parts of the world during the scientific expedition of the British corvette, H.M.S. Challenger.<query> what is the average salinity of ocean water</query> The Challenger expedition, organized by the British Government at the suggestion of the Royal Society, set out to study the biology of the sea, examine the chemical and physical properties of the water, sample deposits on the ocean floor, and measure water temperatures. The voyage began in 1872 and ended almost 4 years later after covering 68,890 nautical miles. This expedition remains today the longest continuous scientific investigation of the ocean basins. Dittmar's 77 samples are still the only worldwide set of samples of sea water for which complete data (each principal constituent) on chemical composition are available. More recent data, reflecting improvements in analytical and sampling techniques, show slight deviations from Dittmar's results, but these changes do not affect the overall usefulness of his work. The average composition of the 77 samples is as shown on the following table.<query> what was the purpose of the challenger expedition</query> The salinity of water in the open sea is not fixed at 35 o/oo even in areas distant from land; that figure is only an average. On a worldwide basis, a maximum salinity of 36 o/oo occurs at about latitudes 20º N. and 20º S. The average salinity of sea water, 35 o/oo , occurs at the Equator. A minimum salinity of 31 o/oo corresponds approximately with latitude 60º N., whereas lowest salinities of 33 o/oo in the Southern Hemisphere occur at latitude 60º S. At the Equator, where salinity is 35 o/oo, the dilution of sea water by rain is offset by the loss of water by evaporation. But in the latitudes bordering the Equator the opposite condition prevails -- evaporation exceeds rainfall because high temperatures plus increased winds accelerate evaporation losses.<query> what is the average salinity of water</query> HOW SEA LIFE AFFECTS SEA WATER'S COMPOSITION... Inasmuch as the oceans receive most of their water from the rivers, the ratios (as distinguished from the total amounts) of different chemical constituents should be about the same in both regardless of total salt content. But this is not so. Comparisons of Dittmar's data on ocean water with the average salt concentrations in river waters of the world is as shown on the preceding table (above). Sea water and river water obviously are very different from each other: (1) Sodium and chloride (the components of common table salt) constitute a little more than 85 percent of the dissolved solids in ocean water and give to the water its characteristic salty taste, but they represent less than 16 percent of the salt content of river water. (2) Rivers carry to the sea more calcium than chloride, but the oceans nevertheless contain about 46 times more chloride than calcium.<query> what is the difference between sea water and river water</query> (3) Silica is a significant constituent of river water but not of sea water. (4) Calcium and bicarbonate account for nearly 50 percent of the dissolved solids in river water yet constitute less than 2 percent of the dissolved solids in ocean water. These variations seem contrary to what one would expect. Part of the explanation is the role played by marine life -- animals and plants -- in ocean water's composition. Sea water is not simply a solution of salts and dissolved gases unaffected by living organisms in the sea. Mollusks (oysters, clams, and mussels, for example) extract calcium from the sea to build their shells and skeletons. Foraminifers (very small one-celled sea animals) andcrustaceans (such as crabs, shrimp, lobsters, and barnacles) likewise take out large amounts of calcium salts to build their bodies.<query> what is the role of animals in the composition of ocean water</query> Coral reefs, common in warm tropical seas, consist mostly of limestone (calcium carbonate) formed over millions of years from the skeletons of billions of small corals and other sea animals. Plankton (tiny floating animal and plant life) also exerts control on the composition of sea water. Diatoms, members of the plankton community, require silica to form their shells and they draw heavily on the ocean's silica for this purpose. Some marine organisms concentrate or secrete chemical elements that are present in such minute amounts in sea water as to be almost undetectable: Lobsters concentrate copper and cobalt; snails secrete lead; the sea cucumber extracts vanadium; and sponges and certain seaweeds remove iodine from the sea. Sea life has a strong influence on the composition of sea water. However, some elements in sea water are not affected to any apparent extent by plant or animal life.<query> what is the composition of the ocean</query> For example, no known biological process removes the element sodium from the sea. In addition to biological influences, the factors of solubility and physical-chemical reaction rates also help to explain the composition of sea water. The solubility of a constituent may limit its concentration in sea water. Excess calcium (more calcium than the water can hold) may be precipitated out of the water and deposited on the sea floor as calcium carbonate. Presumably as a result of physical-chemical reactions not well understood, the metal manganese occurs as nodules in many places on the ocean floor. Similarly,phosphorite (phosphate rock) is found in large amounts on the sea bottom off southern California and in lesser amounts in several other places. NEAR-CONSTANT RATIOS OF MAJOR CONSTITUENTS... Although the composition of sea water differs from that of river water, the proportions of the major constituents of sea water are almost constant throughout the world.<query> what is the composition of sea water</query> Obviously, the ocean, in contrast to the water we use daily, contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals; it is too salty for human consumption. HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN?... How salty the ocean is, however, defies ordinary comprehension. Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons (50 million billion tons) of dissolved solids. If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick, about the height of a 40-story office building. The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake. For example, when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt, but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth (0.01) of a pound of salt, or about one sixth of an ounce.<query> how much salt is in the ocean</query> Dittmar's 77 samples showed no significant global differences in relative composition, and his average concentrations are used today to represent the ratios of major constituents in sea water. The analyses, which Dittmar made over a period of 9 years, further showed that chloride, sodium, magnesium, sulfate, calcium, and potassium make up 99 percent of the dissolved solids in sea water. Dittmar's findings may be expressed in another way: although the salinity or total salt content may vary from place to place, the ratio of any one major constituent of sea water (chloride as an example) to the total content is nearly constant. However, the ratios of the less abundant elements (aluminum, copper, tin, and bismuth, for example) to total salt content are not constant nor are those of dissolved gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.<query> what is the composition of sea water</query> But establishment of the near constancy of the ratios of major constituents of sea water is important because it enables scientists to measure one principal element and then, by projection of ratios and correction for temperature and pressure, to calculate the other components in the water, thereby determining its salinity. SUMMARY... The ocean is salty because of the gradual concentration of dissolved chemicals eroded from the Earth's crust and washed into the sea. Solid and gaseous ejections from volcanoes, suspended particles swept to the ocean from the land by onshore winds, and materials dissolved from sediments deposited on the ocean floor have also contributed. Salinity is increased by evaporation or by freezing of sea ice and it is decreased as a result of rainfall, runoff, or the melting of ice. The average salinity of sea water is 35 o/oo, but concentrations as high as 40 o/oo are observed in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> Salinities are much less than average in coastal waters, in the polar seas, and near the mouths of large rivers. Sea water not only is much saltier than river water but it also differs in the proportion of the various salts. Sodium and chloride constitute 85 percent of the dissolved solids in sea water and account for the characteristic salty taste. Certain constituents in sea water, such as calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, and silica, are partly taken out of solution by biological organisms, chemical precipitation, or physical-chemical reactions. In open water the chemical composition of sea water is nearly constant. Because of the stable ratios of the principal constituents to total salt content, the determination of one major constituent can be used to calculate sea water salinity. For minor constituents and dissolved gases the composition is variable and therefore ratios cannot be used to calculate salt Circulation and mixing, density and ocean currents, wind action, water temperature, solubility, and biochemical reactions are some of the factors that explain why the composition of water in the open sea is almost constant from place to place.<query> why is the chemical composition of sea water constant</query> This information is from a general interest publication (""Why is the Ocean Salty?"" By Herbert Swenson) prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey to provide information about the earth sciences, natural resources, and the environment. To obtain a catalog of additional titles in the series ""General Interest Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey,"" write: U.S. Geological Survey Branch of Distribution P.O. Box 25286 Denver, CO 80225 For sale by the U.S. Government Printing Office Superintendent of Documents, Mail Stop: SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328<query> why is the ocean salty</query> Thus, sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water. What arouses the scientist's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty, but why it isn't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it. Further, what is the origin of the sea and of its ""salts""? And how does one explain ocean water's remarkably uniform chemical composition? To these and related questions, scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood. Illustration: Sources of salts in the ocean. THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA... In popular language, ""ocean"" and ""sea"" are used interchangeably. Today's seas are the North and South Pacific, North and South Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas. Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> There are several theories about the origin of the seas, but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle. Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of ""degassing"" of the Earth's interior. According to this theory, the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth. After the Earth's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water, rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries. As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth's surface, the primeval ocean came into existence. The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet. SOURCES OF THE SALTS...<query> what is the origin of the ocean</query> Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything. Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas. Most of the ocean's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth's crust by weathering and erosion, the wearing down of mountains, and the dissolving action of rains and streams which transported their mineral washings to the sea. Some of the ocean's salts have been dissolved from rocks and sediments below its floor. Other sources of salts include the solid and gaseous materials that escaped from the Earth's crust through volcanic vents or that originated in the atmosphere. IF FRESH WATER FLOWS OUT TO THE SEA, WHY IS THE SEA STILL SALTY?... The Mississippi, Amazon, and Yukon Rivers empty respectively into the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, all of which are salty.<query> why is ocean water salty</query> Why aren't the oceans as fresh as the river waters that empty into them? Because the saltiness of the ocean is the result of several natural influences and processes, the salt load of the streams entering the ocean is just one of these factors. In the beginning the primeval seas must have been only slightly salty. But ever since the first rains descended upon the young Earth hundreds of millions of years ago and ran over the land breaking up rocks and transporting their minerals to the seas, the ocean has become saltier. It is estimated that the rivers and streams flowing from the United States alone discharge 225 million tons of dissolved solids and 513 million tons of suspended sediment annually to the sea. Recent calculations show yields of dissolved solids from other land masses that range from about 6 tons per square mile for Australia to about 120 tons per square mile for Europe.<query> why are the oceans salty</query> Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated 4 billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually. About the same tonnage of salt from the ocean water probably is deposited as sediment on the ocean bottom, and thus, yearly gains may offset yearly losses. In other words, the oceans today probably have a balanced salt input and outgo. Past accumulations of dissolved and suspended solids in the sea do not explain completely why the ocean is salty. Salts become concentrated in the sea because the Sun's heat distills or vaporizes almost pure water from the surface of the sea and leaves the salts behind. This process is part of the continual exchange of water between the Earth and the atmosphere that is called the hydrologic cycle. Water vapor rises from the ocean surface and is carried landward by the winds. When the vapor collides with a colder mass of air, it condenses (changes from a gas to a liquid) and falls to Earth as rain.<query> why is the ocean salty</query> The rain runs off into streams which in turn transport water to the ocean. Evaporation from both the land and the ocean again causes water to return to the atmosphere as vapor and the cycle starts anew. The ocean, then, is not fresh like river water because of the huge accumulation of salts by evaporation and the contribution of raw salts from the land. In fact, since the first rainfall, the seas have become saltier. SEA WATER IS NOT SIMPLE... Scientists have studied the ocean's water for more than a century, but they still do not have a complete understanding of its chemical composition. This is partly due to the lack of precise methods and procedures for measuring the constituents in sea water. Some of the problems confronting scientists stem from the enormous size of the oceans, which cover about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, and the complex chemical system inherent in a marine environment in which constituents of sea water have intermingled over vast periods of time.<query> why is ocean water not fresh</query> At least 72 chemical elements have been identified in sea water, most in extremely small amounts. Probably all the Earth's naturally occurring elements exist in the sea. Elements may combine in various ways and form insoluble products (or precipitates) that sink to the ocean floor. But even these precipitates are subject to chemical alteration because of the overlying sea water which continues to exert its environmental influence. SALINITY AND ITS VARIABILITY... Oceanographers report salinity (total salt content) and the concentrations of individual chemical constituents in sea water -- chloride, sodium, or magnesium for example -- inparts per thousand, for which the symbol o/oo is used. That is, a salinity of 35 o/oo means 35 pounds of salt per 1,000 pounds of sea water. Similarly, a sodium concentration of 10 o/oo means 10 pounds of sodium per 1,000 pounds of water.<query> what is the chemical composition of seawater</query>"

Email Share Close del.icio.us Digg Facebook reddit StumbleUpon Twitter E-mail It Recipients' Email Address: Your Name: Your Email Address: NOTE:<query> what should you really eat</query> The guidelines say that it's okay to eat up to half of our bread, cereal, rice, pasta, and other grain foods in their fiber- and nutrient-depleted, refined forms. That’s unfortunate, because in the body, refined grains like white bread and white rice act just like sugar. Over time, eating too much of these refined grain foods can make it harder to control weight, and can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Too lenient on red meat and processed meat. High intakes of red meat, such as beef, pork, and lamb, are associated with a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. (4-6) Yet nowhere in the guidelines does it say to limit red meat. The guidelines also don't give adequate warning about the hazards of processed meats, such as bacon and hot dogs, which are even more strongly linked to heart disease and diabetes.<query> foods that raise risk of diabetes</query> Too much dairy. The guidelines’ recommendation to increase the intake of low-fat milk and dairy products seems to reflect the interests of the powerful dairy industry more so than the latest science. There is little, if any, evidence that eating dairy prevents osteoporosis or fractures, and there is considerable evidence that high dairy product consumption is associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. (Read more aboutcalcium, milk and health.) The Problems with MyPyramid and MyPlate Distilling nutrition advice into a pyramid has its merits: The shape immediately suggests that some foods are good and should be eaten often, and that others aren't so good and should be eaten only occasionally. The layers represent major food groups that contribute to the total diet. MyPyramid tried to do this in an abstract way, without any text or food images on it, and failed.<query> why is dairy bad for you</query> And it forced people to go to a Web site to learn what they should eat. (Read more about theproblems with MyPyramid and its predecessor, the original Food Guide Pyramid.) The MyPlate icon is an improvement over MyPyramid: It shows a circle divided into four brightly-colored wedges, each labeled with the name of a food group. Vegetables (green) and fruits (red) take up half the plate. Proteins (purple) and grains (brown) each get one quarter of the plate. Just off to the side is a smaller blue circle for dairy products, looking a bit like a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt. A fork and placemat complete the place setting. The MyPlate icon nudges Americans to put more produce on their plates, but it still falls short on giving people all the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> what is the food icon on myplate</query> And as a shorthand version of the US government’s nutrition advice, MyPlate suffers from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010’s shortcomings, as well. MyPlate does not show that whole grains are a better choice than refined grains, for example, or that beans, nuts, fish, and chicken are healthier choices than red meat. Healthy fats—key to heart health and to lowering the risk of diabetes—do not appear at all on the plate or the table. Yet dairy is given a prominent place right next to the plate, despite evidence that high intakes of dairy products do not reduce the risk of osteoporosis and may increase the risk of some chronic diseases. Perhaps the greatest problem is that MyPlate is silent on the large portion of the US diet that's junk: sugary drinks, sweets, salty processed foods, refined grains, and the like.<query> what is myplate</query> Building a Better Pyramid and Plate If the only goal of the USDA's food icons is to give us the best possible advice for healthy eating, then they should be grounded in the evidence and be independent of commercial interests. Instead of waiting for this to happen, nutrition experts from the Harvard School of Public Health created the Healthy Eating Pyramid, and updated it in 2008. And in September 2011, working with colleagues at Harvard Health Publications, they created the Healthy Eating Plate. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the best available scientific evidence about the links between diet and health. They fix fundamental flaws in the USDA food pyramids and plate and offer sound information to help people make better choices about what to eat. (View a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Pyramid, in a separate window; view a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Plate, in a separate window.) The Healthy Eating Pyramid The Healthy Eating Pyramid sits on a foundation of daily exercise and weight control.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Why? These two related elements strongly influence your chances of staying healthy. They also affect what you eat and how your food affects you. Exercise and weight control are also linked through the simple rule of energy balance: Weight change = calories in – calories out. If you burn as many calories as you take in each day, there's nothing left over for storage in fat cells, and weight remains the same. Eat more than you burn, though, and you end up adding fat and pounds. Regular exercise can help you control your weight, and it is a key part of any weight-loss effort. The other bricks of the Healthy Eating Pyramid include the following: Whole Grains Read more about whole grains. The body uses carbohydrates mainly for energy, and it can get them from many sources—some healthful (beans, vegetables, fruit, whole grains), and some not (sugary sodas and other drinks, sweets).<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The best grain sources of carbohydrates are whole grains such as oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and brown rice. They deliver the outer (bran) and inner (germ) layers along with energy-rich starch. The body can't digest whole grains as quickly as it can highly processed carbohydrates such as white flour. This keeps blood sugar and insulin levels from rising, then falling, too quickly. Better control of blood sugar and insulin can keep hunger at bay and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Healthy Fats and Oils Read more about healthy fats. Surprised that the Healthy Eating Pyramid puts some fats near the base, indicating they are okay to eat? Although this recommendation seems to go against conventional wisdom, it's exactly in line with the evidence and with common eating habits.<query> what is the best source of carbohydrates for diabetes</query> The average American gets one-third or more of his or her daily calories from fats, so placing them near the foundation of the pyramid makes sense. Note, though, that it specifically mentions healthy fats and oils, not all types of fat. Good sources of healthy unsaturated fats include olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and other vegetable oils; trans fat–free margarines; nuts, seeds, and avocados; and fatty fish such as salmon. These healthy fats not only improve cholesterol levels (when eaten in place of highly processed carbohydrates), but the fats in fish can also protect the heart from sudden and potentially deadly rhythm problems. Vegetables and Fruits Read more about veggies and fruits. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits has bountiful benefits. Among them: It can decrease the chances of having a heart attack or stroke; possibly protect against some types of cancers; lower blood pressure; help you avoid the painful intestinal ailment called diverticulitis; guard against cataract and macular degeneration, the major causes of vision loss among people over age 65; and add variety to your diet and wake up your palate.<query> what foods are healthy</query> On the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes don’t count as a vegetable, since they are chock full of rapidly digested starch, and they have the same effect on blood sugar as refined grains and sweets. That’s why potatoes are in the “Use Sparingly” tip. Nuts, Seeds, Beans, and Tofu Read more about healthy protein. These plant foods are excellent sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Beans include black beans, navy beans, garbanzos, lentils, and other beans that are usually sold dried. Many kinds of nuts contain healthy fats, and packages of some varieties (almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, and pistachios) can carry a label saying they're good for your heart. Eating nuts and beans in place of red meat or processed meat can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fish, Poultry, and Eggs Read more about omega 3s.<query> what foods are good for your heart</query> These foods are also important sources of protein. A wealth of research suggests that eating fish can reduce the risk of heart disease, since fish is rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Chicken and turkey are also good sources of protein and can be low in saturated fat. Eggs, which have long been demonized because they contain fairly high levels of cholesterol, aren't as bad as they've been cracked up to be. In fact, an egg is a much better breakfast than a doughnut cooked in an oil rich in trans fats or a bagel made from refined flour. People with diabetes or heart disease should limit their egg yolk consumption to no more than three a week; they can try egg whites, instead, which are very high in protein and are a fine substitute for whole eggs in omelets and baking.<query> what is the best breakfast for diabetics</query> Recipients' Email Address currently accepts only 5 email addresses separated by commas.

Building bone and keeping it strong takes calcium, vitamin D, exercise, and a whole lot more. So why does the Healthy Eating Pyramid recommend limiting dairy products, which have traditionally been Americans' main source of calcium and vitamin D? Because most people need more vitamin D than they can get from drinking three glasses of milk—and they need less calcium than three glasses of milk provide. Though there are some health benefits from modest dairy intake, high dairy intakes are associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. There are other healthier ways to get calcium than from milk and cheese, which can contain a lot of saturated fat; cheese is also high in sodium. If you enjoy dairy foods, stick to one to two servings a day; you may also need to take a multivitamin or vitamin D supplement to get enough vitamin D. If you don't like dairy products, taking a vitamin D and calcium supplement (or taking the right multivitamin) offers an easy and inexpensive way to meet your needs for these micronutrients.<query> what is the best food to eat to get calcium</query> Use Sparingly: Red Meat, Processed Meat, and Butter These foods sit at the top of the Healthy Eating Pyramid because they contain lots of saturated fat. Processed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats are also very high in added sodium. Eating a lot of red meat and processed meat has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. So it’s best to avoid processed meat, and to limit red meat to no more than twice a week. Switching to fish, chicken, nuts, or beans in place of red meat and processed meat can improve cholesterol levels and can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. So can switching from butter to olive oil. And eating fish has other benefits for the heart. Use Sparingly: Refined Grains—White Bread, Rice, and Pasta; Potatoes; Sugary Drinks and Sweets; Salt Read more about carbohydrates.<query> what to eat to lower cholesterol</query> Why are these all-American staples at the top, rather than the bottom, of the Healthy Eating Pyramid? White bread, white rice, white pasta, other refined grains, potatoes, sugary drinks, and sweets can cause fast and furious increases in blood sugar that can lead to weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic disorders. Whole grains cause slower, steadier increases in blood sugar that don't overwhelm the body's ability to handle carbohydrate. Read more about salt and sodium. The salt shaker should be used sparingly, based on extensive research linking high-sodium diets to increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Since most of the sodium in our diets comes from processed foods, such as cheese, breads, deli meats, spaghetti with sauce, and food prepared away from home, make sure to compare food labels and choose foods with the lowest sodium values.<query> foods that cause fasting blood sugar</query> Multivitamin with Extra Vitamin D (for Most People) Read more about vitamins. A daily multivitamin, multimineral supplement offers a kind of nutritional backup, especially when it includes some extra vitamin D. While a multivitamin can't in any way replace healthy eating, or make up for unhealthy eating, it can fill in the nutrient holes that may sometimes affect even the most careful eaters. You don't need an expensive name-brand or designer vitamin. Look for a multivitamin that meets the requirements of the USP (U.S. Pharmacopeia), an organization that sets standards for drugs and supplements. A standard, store-brand, RDA-level one is fine for most nutrients—except vitamin D. In addition to its bone-health benefits, there's growing evidence that getting some extra vitamin D can help lower the risk of colon and breast cancer.<query> what vitamins are good for you</query> Aim for getting at least 800 to 1,000 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day; multiple vitamins are now available with this amount. (Many people, especially those who spend the winter in the northern U.S. or have darker skin, will need extra vitamin D, often a total of 2,000 IU per day or more, to bring their blood levels up to an adequate range. If you fall into one of these groups, which would include most of the U.S. population, taking 2,000 IU is reasonable and well within the safe range. As always, it’s a good idea to discuss use of supplements with your doctor, and he or she may want to order a vitamin D blood test.) Optional: Alcohol in Moderation (Not for Everyone) Read more about alcohol. Scores of studies suggest that having an alcoholic drink a day lowers the risk of heart disease.<query> how much vitamin d should i take a day</query> Moderation is clearly important, since alcohol has risks as well as benefits. For men, a good balance point is one to two drinks a day; in general, however, the risks of drinking, even in moderation, exceed benefits until middle age. For women, it's at most one drink a day; women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy. Focus on Food Quality You'll notice that the Healthy Eating Pyramid does not give specific advice about the numbers of cups or ounces to have each day of specific foods. That's because it's not meant to be a rigid road map, and the amounts can vary depending on your body size and physical activity. It's a simple, general, flexible guide to how you should eat when you eat. To follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid, there's just one basic guideline to remember: A healthy diet includes more foods from the base of the pyramid than from the higher levels of the pyramid.<query> how many ounces of alcohol should i drink a day</query> Within this guideline, however, there's plenty of flexibility for different styles of eating and different food choices. A vegetarian can follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid by emphasizing nuts, beans, and other plant sources of protein, and choosing non-dairy sources of calcium and vitamin D; someone who eats animal products can choose fish or chicken for protein, with occasional red meat. Choosing a variety of fresh, whole foods from all the food groups below the ""Use Sparingly"" category in the Healthy Eating Pyramid will ensure that you get the nutrients you need. It will also dramatically lower your salt intake, since most of the salt in the U.S. diet lurks in processed food—canned soups, frozen dinners, deli meats, snack chips, and the like. Perhaps the only foods that are truly off-limits are foods that contain trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils.<query> what to eat on the healthy eating pyramid</query> Luckily, in the U.S. and Canada, trans fats must be listed on nutrition labels. More and more food manufacturers, restaurants, and even entire communities are going trans fat–free, making it easier to avoid this health-damaging type of fat. The Healthy Eating Plate When it’s time for dinner, most of us eat off of a plate. So think of the Healthy Eating Plate as a blueprint for a typical meal, for yourself and your family. It’s similar in concept to MyPlate, with colorful quadrants reserved for vegetables (green), fruits (red), protein (orange), and grains (brown). But unlike MyPlate, it offers important messages about diet quality, not just quantity: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. The more color, and the more variety, the better.<query> what is the healthy eating plate</query> Most Americans don't get enough vegetables, especially the dark green and red-orange types, or fruits. On the Healthy Eating Plate, just like the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes and French fries don't count as vegetables. Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains—not just any grains:MyPlate tells you to reserve a quarter of your plate for grains. But grains arenot essential for good health. What’s essential is to make any grains you eatwhole grains, since these have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than refined grains. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, oats, barley, and the like, as well as foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta. The less processed the whole grains, the better: Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested, and in turn, has a greater impact on blood sugar than more coarsely ground or intact grains.<query> what to eat to lower blood sugar</query> So choose steel cut oats instead of instant, sugared oats or choose whole wheatberries instead of whole wheat bread. Pick a healthy source of protein to fill one quarter of your plate: On MyPlate, the “protein” quadrant of the plate could be filled with a hamburger or hot dog. The Healthy Eating Plate, in contrast, acknowledges that some protein sources (fish, chicken, beans, nuts) are healthier than others (red meat and processed meat). Enjoy healthy fats. The glass bottle near the Healthy Eating Plate is a reminder to use healthy oils, like olive and canola, in cooking, on salad, and at the table. Limit butter, and avoid unhealthy trans fats. Though the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 acknowledges that Americans need to consume more plant oils, these healthy oils are nowhere to be found on MyPlate.<query> what is healthy eating plate</query> This simple illustration conveyed in a flash what the USDA said were the elements of a healthy diet. The Pyramid was taught in schools, appeared in countless media articles and brochures, and was plastered on cereal boxes and food labels. About the Healthy Eating Plate: Your Questions Answered Comparing the Healthy Eating Plate to the USDA's MyPlate The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010: Progress, Not Perfection The Long Road to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Commentary from Dr. Walter Willett and Colleagues on the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report(PDF) Carbohydrates: Good Carbs Guide the Way Protein: Moving Closer to Center Stage Fats and Cholesterol: Out with the Bad, In with the Good Vegetables and Fruits: Get Plenty Every Day Calcium and Milk: What's Best for Your Bones and Health?

On the Healthy Eating Plate, complete your meal with a glass of water, or if you like, a cup of tea orcoffee (which also are low calorie and have health benefits)—not the glass of milk that MyPlate recommends. (Questions about caffeine and kids? Read more.) Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day and limit juice to a small glass per day. Skip the sugary drinks. Stay active. The figure scampering across the bottom of the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Since two out of three U.S. adults and one in three children are overweight or obese, one thing is clear: Many of us have been choosing plates that are too large.<query> what to eat on a healthy eating plate</query> Using the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate complement each other. Both emphasize foods that promote good health. And both encourage people to limit or avoid foods and drinks that are harmful, or that provide lots of calories but have little nutritional value. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery list: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy oils, and healthy proteins like nuts, beans, fish, and chicken should make it into your shopping cart every week. Add a little yogurt or milk if you like. Skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. Let the Healthy Eating Plate be your guide to planning a healthy, balanced meal and serving it on a dinner plate—or packing it in a lunch box.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Put a copy on the refrigerator at home or at work, to give you a visual guide to portioning out a healthy plate, and a reminder to pump up the produce. The Healthy Eating Pyramid also addresses other aspects of a healthy lifestyle—exercise, weight control, vitamin D and multivitamin supplements, and moderation in alcohol for people who drink—so it’s a useful tool for health professionals and health educators. Other Alternatives to MyPlate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the companion Healthy Eating Plate summarize the best dietary information available today. They aren’t set in stone, though, because nutrition researchers will undoubtedly turn up new information in the years ahead. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate will change to reflect important new evidence. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate aren't the only alternatives to the USDA's MyPlate.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The Asian, Latin, Mediterranean, and vegetarian pyramids promoted by Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust are also good, evidence-based guides for healthy eating. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate take advantage of even more extensive research and offer a broader guide that is not based on a specific culture. The original Healthy Eating Pyramid is described in greater detail inEat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating, by Walter C. Willett, M.D. (the Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health) with Patrick J. Skerrett (published by Simon & Schuster, 2001, and Free Press, 2005). Evidence that Following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate Lowers Disease Risk What’s the payoff for following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate?<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> A lower risk of heart disease and premature death, according to research done at Harvard School of Public Health and elsewhere. (7- 9) Back in the 1990s, the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion created the Healthy Eating Index ""to measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns."" (10) A score of 100 meant following the federal recommendations (including those of the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid) to the letter while a score of 0 meant totally ignoring them. To see how well the principles embodied in the Healthy Eating Pyramid stacked up against the government's advice, Harvard School of Public Health researchers created an Alternate Healthy Eating Index with a scoring system similar to the USDA's index. They then compared the two indexes, using information about daily diets collected from more than 100,000 female nurses and male health professionals taking part in two long-term studies.<query> what is the usda food guide pyramid</query> Men who scored highest on the USDA's original Healthy Eating Index (meaning their diets most closely followed federal recommendations) reduced their overall risk of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic disease by 11 percent over 8 to 12 years of follow-up compared to those who scored lowest. Women who most closely followed the government's recommendations were only 3 percent less likely to have developed a chronic disease. (6) In comparison, scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index created at the Harvard School of Public Health did appear to correlate more closely with better health in both sexes. Men with high scores (those whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines) were 20 percent less likely to have developed a major chronic disease than those with low scores. Women with high scores lowered their overall risk by 11 percent.<query> what is the usda healthy eating index</query> Men whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by almost 40 percent; women with high scores lowered their risk by almost 30 percent. Two recent studies offer further evidence of the disease prevention benefits that accrue from following a diet similar to the Healthy Eating Pyramid: A study that tracked 7,319 British civil servants for 18 years found that men and women with the highest scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index had a 25 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 42 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease, than people with the lowest scores. (7) Another observational study in 93,676 post-menopausal women found that following a Healthy Eating Pyramid–style diet (as measured by adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was superior to following a low-fat diet at lowering cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk.<query> what is the benefit of the healthy eating pyramid</query> (8) References 1.

Its blueprint was based on shaky scientific evidence, and it barely changed over the years to reflect major advances in our understanding of the connection between diet and health. The USDA retired the Food Guide Pyramid in 2005 and replaced it with MyPyramid—basically the old Pyramid turned on its side, sans any explanatory text. Critics lambasted the symbol from the get-go for being vague and confusing. So in June 2011, with great fanfare, the USDA replaced its much-maligned MyPyramid with a new simpler food icon, the fruit-and-vegetable rich MyPlate. The good news is that these changes have dismantled and buried the original, flawed Food Guide Pyramid and its underwhelming MyPyramid successor. The bad news is that the new MyPlate icon, while an improvement over the Food Guide Pyramid and MyPyramid, still falls short on giving people the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> when was the food pyramid replaced</query> As an alternative to the USDA's nutrition advice, faculty members at the Harvard School of Public Health built the Healthy Eating Pyramid. It resembles the USDA's old pyramids in shape only. The Healthy Eating Pyramid takes into consideration, and puts into perspective, the wealth of research conducted during the last 20 years that has reshaped the definition of healthy eating. Now it's time to translate that research to your dinner plate: the Healthy Eating Plate. Just as the Healthy Eating Pyramid rectifies the mistakes of the USDA's food pyramids, the Healthy Eating Plate fixes the flaws in USDA's MyPlate. Both the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the latest science about how our food, drink, and activity choices affect our health. Building MyPyramid and MyPlate In the children's book Who Built the Pyramid?, (1) different people take credit for building the once-grand Egyptian pyramid of Senwosret.<query> who built the healthy eating pyramid</query> King Senwosret, of course, claims the honor. But so does his architect, the quarry master, the stonecutters, slaves, and the boys who carried water to the workers. The USDA's pyramids and MyPlate also had many builders. Some are obvious—USDA scientists, nutrition experts, staff members, and consultants. Others aren't. Intense lobbying efforts from a variety of food industries also helped shape the pyramid and the plate. In theory, the USDA’s food icons should reflect the nutrition advice assembled in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. According to the USDA, the guidelines ""provide authoritative advice for people two years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases."" This document, which by law must be considered for revision every five years, aims to offer sound nutrition advice that corresponds to the latest scientific research.<query> who were the builders of the usda pyramids</query> The government seeks advice from a scientific panel, one that must include nutrition experts who are leaders in pediatrics, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and public health. Selecting the panelists is no easy task, and is subject to intense lobbying from organizations such as the National Dairy Council, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Soft Drink Association, the American Meat Institute, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Salt Institute, and the Wheat Foods Council. (2) The scientific panel generates a report of 400 or so pages of dense nutrition-speak. The USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services use this report to prepare the 100-page Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The process, however, is less than transparent. And the folks who actually write the final guidelines don't always hew to the scientific panel's recommendations.<query> who is the scientific panel</query> The hefty Dietary Guidelines for Americans document is translated into a reader-friendly brochure aimed at helping the average person choose a balanced and healthy diet. Of far greater importance, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans set the standards for all federal nutrition programs, including the school lunch program, and help determine what food products Americans buy.

The guidelines emphasize eating more foods from plants, such as vegetables and beans, whole grains, and nuts. Choose fish twice a week. They encourage Americans to eat more seafood in place of red meat or poultry, acknowledging its special benefits for the heart. Not all proteins are equally healthy. They recognize that some protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, and eggs, are higher in so-called “solid fats”—the saturated and trans fats that Americans need to cut back on—and recommend replacing them with fish and nuts, or choosing leaner forms of protein. Other recommendations do not go far enough to reflect the latest nutrition science—or bury key messages: Too lax on refined grains.<query> what is the best food to eat for a healthy heart</query>"

clueweb12-0909wb-33-12181,8,1,"Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP Random Hacks Technology and Other Fun Stuff Live Search: edit Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP Posted by Eric Kidd Sat, 03 Dec 2005 11:30:00 GMT Years ago, I looked at Ruby and decided to ignore it. Ruby wasn’t as popular as Python, and it wasn’t as powerful as LISP. So why should I bother? Of course, we could turn those criteria around. What if Ruby were more popular thanLISP, and more powerful than Python? Would that be enough to make Ruby interesting? Before answering this question, we should decide what makes LISP so powerful. Paul Graham haswritten eloquently about LISP’s virtues. But, for the sake of argument, I’d like to boil them down to two things: LISP is a dense functional language. LISP has programmatic macros.<query> why is ruby an acceptable lisp</query> If you need to download a web page, parse RSS, generate graphs, or call a SOAP API, you’re all set. Now, given a choice between a powerful language, and popular language, it may makeexcellent sense to pick the powerful one. But if the difference in power is minor, being popular has all sorts of nice advantages. In 2005, I’d think long and hard before choosing LISP over Ruby. I’d probably only do it if I needed optimized code, or macros which acted as full-fledged compilers. (Thank you to Michael Fromberger for reviewing an early draft of this essay.) Tags LISP, Macros, Recommended, Ruby Comments nuke edit Excellent Article said about 4 hours later: Eric, thank you for this excellent article. I have toyed with Lisp for several years now, and while I agree it is more powerful, I have made the decision to build my sites in Ruby for many of the reasons you have cited.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Instead of loop { obj.meth } it should have done loop.obj.meth which would complete it being Consistently Object Oriented™. You see, the great thing behind Lisp isn’t the macros, although they are nice. Instead, there are two real things that Lisp provides, which aren’t found in other language. To sum: 1): In Lisp, everything is a function. ‘If’ is a function, ‘cond’ is a function , ‘defun’ is a function. ‘and’ and ‘or’ are not logical operators, they are functions, too. They return values, as well. With that in mind, it becomes possible to write very powerfull, dense code. 2): Lisp has only one syntax rule (with the exeption of read macros): (function arguments). Any argument may be a function.<query> what is lisp macro</query> This is simple and consistent, and one can rely on it being this way. That’s not to say it isn’t mind-bending and it definitely can drive one mad. But it is the only syntax. If ruby had been just a little bit more consistent, it would truly have been ‘the newLISP’; instead, it is the latest new OO language. Mind you, Ruby is a very nice language and it has very nice (though imperfect) syntax, community and libraries, and for quick webapps, it definitely rocks. But it isn’t a new LISP, not by a long shot. nuke edit Eric said 2 days later: BDW, the operators you list (if, defun, etc.) are technically “special forms,” not functions, because they don’t necessarily evaluate all their arguments.<query> what language is ruby</query> Other than that, your point is good. Bill, here’s some Ruby code (based on ParseTree and an unpublished library of my own), which isn’tentirely unreasonable: assert_body(call(lit(2), :+, lit(3))) do 2 + 3 end The expression in parentheses builds a parse tree, which assert_body compares to the block’s AST. This is a small step towards recreating Paul’s example. Jamie, speaking as a minor contributor to several Lisp compilers, I doubt that Ruby will ever be as fast as Common Lisp. There’s two big obstacles: (1) Ruby metaprogramming happens at runtime, but Lisp macros run in the compiler. It’s hard to beat zero runtime cost. :-) (2) Ruby supports a variety of dynamic features, such as duck typing and method_missing, which are much harder to optimize than the equivalent features in Lisp.<query> is ruby faster than lisp</query> Of course, the best SmallTalk VMs are very good, and a hypothetical Ruby VM could certainly be adequate for almost all applications. nuke edit bill a said 2 days later: BDW, uh, a lot of the stuff in your comment is confusing and/or wrong. Look into that. nuke edit bill a said 2 days later: Eric, that’s cool. I figured ParseTree would eventually be able to do something like that. Still, I think that even writing macros in an intermediate format is a lot less convenient and maintainable than Lisp macros – what happens when the interface to ParseTree changes? What happens when a new version of Ruby comes out and breaks everything? I’m still sticking with Lisp. :) nuke edit PleaseDontKillMe said 2 days later: NOTE: I originally posted this on Zifus blog up there.<query> what is the difference between lisp and parsetree</query> Posting here for completion’s sake.

The code above is actually written against my own high-levelAPI, not against ParseTree itself.<query> when is winter break for lisp</query> The real danger is a VM change in Ruby 2.0, which would pretty much kill ParseTree. I suppose if somebody builds something stunningly cool right now, it might help keep ParseTree alive on a future VM. Not a good argument for a production system. :-/ nuke edit Johnny said 2 days later: (I know, I know…) I agree, my “PleaseDontKillMe” friend. Programming is a means, not an end in itself.

I started in LISP in the late 80’s then went to python in the early 90’s. Python has always had native rich functional support. - lambda - map - apply Python 2.2 (release python now 2.4) added – iterators Python 2.4 added decorators that simplify generic programming.

You could have just deleted the offensive words because the intent of the post was not to troll. But this is your blog and that is fine. Even though, there were some uncomfortable things that I said and I hope it wasn’t because of those uncomfortable truths (and I don’t meand the “F” words) that you decided to pull the comment whole hog. this also illustrates one of the points I tried to make. An un-necessarily haughty attitude when it comes to ideas which challenge the status-quo in our mind. My apologies for “excessive profanity”.

Languages mold their speakers, and the speakers mold their languages. Latin and Sanskrit maybe the ‘best’ languages, but I wonder why the world don’t use them no-mo ?? My question to the Lispers/Forthers/Smalltakers was: Do you want to be the Sanskrit of the world, spoken only by the high-priests and teetring always on the brink of extinction owing your existence to the continued existence of the high-priests? or do you want to be the lingua franca, (lets say, English) of the world? Spoken by the masses to make their lives happen on a day to day basis? The choice is yours, and if you “love” the language, then you will do things which are not short-sighted in nature (closed source/obfuscation/needless punditry) and which help the cause of your so called ‘love’ (open sourcing, helping, creation of killer apps for mass penetration) By killer apps I don’t mean other dialects of the favorite language (or extremely expensive retail software) In cany case, thanks for starting a thought provoking post.<query> what language do they speak</query> ::AAEBACMD:: nuke edit Jim said 3 days later: bill a, Please make Lisp on a Ladder.

It needs some more exciting things going on! nuke edit bill a said 4 days later: Jim: Yes, it would have to be as cross-platform and cross-implementation as humanly possible. I will be sure to test it onCLISP, since anything that runs on CLISP will run on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X, Windows, etc. I’m also planning to release tutorial videos as part of the project (as soon as xvidcap stops crashing when I hit record) on a whole variety of topics, from the basics of Lisp, to using Emacs +SLIME, to the specifics of the Lisp on a Ladder framework, to developing a toy application (let’s say a blog) in some ridiculous amount of time – let’s say four minutes.<query> can lisp run on linux</query> I am constantly re-evaluating my choice of language tools, and have wondered if I made a mistake not building my site in Lisp. (It’s still in development now, but keep an eye our for Zifus around the first part of 2006). I recently read an article by the developers of reddit that suggested they are considering re-writing their site at some point in the future. He cited as a specific difficulty with Lisp that many of the libraries that quickly become available in other languages are slower to appear in Lisp because of the smaller community. Who knows if he was dissembling to throw potential competitors (like me) off track, but in the end it doesn’t matter, the point is valid. Whereas I have been incredibly happy with the progress of Rails as a framework, and I have been utterly delighted with my personal productivity in this wonderful framework.<query> why is lisp slower than other languages</query> While working on this, I’ve realized the answer to a challenge lots of people make: why is there no equivalent to Ruby on Rails in Lisp? I think the answer is that most frameworks exist to save their user the repetition and messiness of typing out similar constructs over and over. With macros, that need is less acute. With environments likeSLIME giving you information about what parameters a macro or function takes, this is also less important. In any case, here are some of the features I’m considering in LoaL: - at the user’s option, LoaL will automatically manage your database schema (this can be turned on or off on either a database-wide or a table-wide basis). So if I make a change to my model code, LoaL would check to make sure the schema matches what’s actually in the table.<query> why is lisp lisp</query> If it doesn’t, and the user isn’t in production mode, it will offer to bring the schema into line with the model, being careful to warn about dropping columns with data in them and so on. - compiled view templates, so minimal time is spent building a view to be sent to the user - instead of shoehorning things into the object-oriented model, LoaL will be able to define language constructs for specific tasks. In RoR, for instance, a method of the controller is automatically available to the public unless I make it private; LoaL will use a (defaction …) form that will make this a non-issue – things are only actions if you make them actions, because actions and methods are different concepts. - less stub generation than Rails. There will probably be some kind of stub generation available, but ideally it would only be to create the application directory and one or two files.<query> what is load model</query> With interactive development, figuring out what goes in a test file isn’t as difficult because the documentation for every macro and function is available at development-time; with macros, stubs aren’t needed as much because the user will be able to say things like (deftestsuite (deftestcase …...) ....) instead of relying on the framework to properly generate a test file. - in development mode (at least), LoaL will ideally give you more certainty about your code – making sure you don’t render nonexistent views or redirect to nonexistent actions; making sure you don’t refer to nonexistent columns in the table. There will be zero cost to this, because it will all be done at compile-time/load-time. (I haven’t completely decided whether this is worthwhile or not). - probably some more LoaL is inspired by Rails but it is neither a clone nor totally an attempt to redesign it.<query> why is load used in development</query> It will be more for public-relations reasons than anything else, since there are certainly frameworks coming that will do things better than LoaL will. Here is a darcs repository with an early, early, EARLY draft (DRAFT!) of some of the constructs LoaLMIGHT offer: loal repo . The file driver.lisp can be viewed in a browser and gives you an idea of whatMIGHT (have I stressed the tentative nature of this enough yet? No? OK, well, driver.lisp is the result of only about an hour of thinking, so I’m sure you can see that it will almost certainly change in drastic ways). There are the beginnings of a portal atloal-web Friendlier URL’s coming soon! Also, any tips on doing narrated video captures in X (on Linux) would be appreciated, since I can’t get xvidcap to stop hating me.<query> what is driver.lisp</query> nuke edit JAP said 4 days later: (for the sake of completeness): SB: thank you for correcting my ignorance, but here I would like to bring a statement of Albert Einstein: “make everything as simple as possible,but not simpler ! That says it all: when you go too far, then you loose something (maybe important), and here it would be:flexibility. So, you really can create some language that seems simpler than Lisp, but then at the same time you loose really too much! (Isn’t that really interesting? You can create a language out of, say, 25 primitive operators, and have something very handy, and you can create a language out of, say, 3 primitive operators, and you have something as-concise-as-no-one-could-ever-beat, but hey, you have lost all of the flexibility, and never will be able to convince the really smart people of this planet!)<query> who said make everything as simple as possible but not simpler</query> I would summarize it this way: the really “perfect formula” for making a programming language is to bring it to exactly that 7 primitive operators that are forming Lisp. Then you have “touched heaven”! (Please don’t take this too literally, I know that in practice this has to be extended, but not inspirit. Anyway, that doesn’t really touch the theory). Any comments, anybody? -JAP nuke edit Jules said 50 days later: There is a language called IO: http://www.guldheden.com/~sandin/amalthea.html It is a very simple language, the only thing is continuations. You can build pairs with continuations, and thus lists, integers, strings, trees. But it is really hard to understand. This: write 5; write 6; terminate Does a lot of things. It first calls “write” with TWO arguments: 5 and “write 6; terminate”.<query> what is the perfect programming language</query> This prints it’s first argument, and then executes the second argument (the rest of the program). write 6 does the same: print 6 to the screen, and call “terminate”. Terminate doesn’t call the rest of the program, so the program will terminate. Integers are continuations too: 1; → a; write a; terminate 1 is a “function” It calls the rest of the program with itself as an argument. The → thing assigns the argument to a, and calls the rest of the program. So you can express everything as continuations. It’s just nice to have these built-in integers and strings to make your programs cleaner, but they are not needed. So this language has only one concept: continuations. You can build for-loops with it, goto’s, etc.<query> what is the difference between an integer and a string</query> IO isVERY flexible. But does this make the language “better”? I find it very hard to understand, but function calls and for loops are hard to understand too (if you are not a programmer). With some practice, first-class continuations are very powerful tools, it’s the only thing you need. I think that every Lisp programmer should check this out. Hard to understand, but very powerfull, and you don’t need macros, because you can express everything concise with continuations. nuke edit Rhodry said 62 days later: Hey people, Interesting discussion. As a Ruby / Rails afficionado its been quite interesting to watch. But as a newbie “Pragmatic Programmer” I am trying to learn a new language each year. After the discussions above, 2006 may just be the “Common Lisp” year :) As a vaguely offtopic curiosity for the veteran Lisp hackers in the list … Has anyone looked at “Intentional Programming”?<query> what language is lisp</query> It was originally (10 years ago) a Microsoft Research project for interactive graphical generation / transformation and reduction of Abstract Syntax Trees [AST] – recently it has been taken into other commercial hands who are trying (but are always delaying) to realize a commercial solution http://www.intentsoft.com/. The original hype sounded brilliant – a graphically rich domain specific language integrated development environment [IDE] – but nothing has yet come of it. (Unlike Rails ) Now, given the vaunted regularity of syntax and metaprogramming capabilities of Lisp (not to mention the existentIDE features of Emacs), surely such a wide-scale, platform-neutral, domain specific graphical visualiser and metaprogrammer environment would fit better within a Lisp variant than Microsoft C/C++ [the original technology bootstrap].

Whatever language is closer to your thoughts… and better fits the solution :) {Might even reduce some of the language holy wars :)} Hoping to stimulate some thoughts… Rhodry nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said 76 days later: Not only is the Lisp world aware of Intentional Programming, Interlisp was likely the forerunner—and a well-known Lisper [1] was the cofounder of Simonyi’s intentional programming company.<query> what language is intentional programming</query> Excellent article, too bad I can post it on Zifus yet, but soon, very soon. nuke edit zlxcgrogdss said about 5 hours later: I’m looking forward to your next editorial, perhaps it could be titled something like “Why Java is an acceptable Forth”. Maybe, if I’m lucky, “Why assembly is an acceptable binary”. What I’m, err, hinting at, is that Ruby is not Lisp. A Lisp is a Lisp because it’s code is represented as its basic data structure. Ruby’s isn’t (unless you argue that Ruby’s code consists of strings, and string is a baic data structure; though I’m sure you’ll agree that this would be pure sophistry). Lisp without this property is like a wheel that isn’t round. The above distinction, along with all of its implications, is the reason Ruby can not be a substitute for Lisp, which, I am assuming, was what you meant to say when you erroneously called Ruby “a Lisp”.<query> why is ruby a lisp</query> http://wiki.alu.org/AudioVideo Kiczales, a coauthor of Lisp's metaobject protocol. Last I heard, he departed Intentsoft. nuke edit Rhodry said 88 days later: I humbly withdraw my misguided implication that the Lisp programming community were not involved in intentional software development and apologise for any offence…. Rhodry nuke edit Eleanor McHugh said 130 days later: As an academically savvy Ruby programmer who works on real-world application development I very much enjoyed reading your article, but I find the religious divide that’s apparent in various of the reactions to it rather strange. I came to Ruby via a circuitous route and my sole concern in using it is whether or not I can concentrate on the abstractions necessary to deliver a maintainable application efficiently and in a timely fashion: this is an area in which Ruby shines.<query> who is kiczales</query> It may have syntax, but it shares this feature with human language and most communications protocols – unsurprisingly really as at the end of the day both source code and real-world computational side-effects are intended for a human audience. Lisp has in part failed to gain mindshare with the broader development community because ultimately it is a mathematical abstraction and (whilst rare amongst classic hackers) most people are perturbed by mathematics. It is an interesting notation if one wishes to develop software as a symbolic representation of a computational parse tree but that is only one theoretical model of the programming process. Ruby on the other hand is an example of a class of languages that will become more prevalent in future years, where the abstractions that make Lisp so powerful are presented in a form that is palatable to those of us with an artistic/lingustic bias as opposed to a mathematical one.<query> why is lisp a good abstraction</query> This is not a new development. It seems to me that Ruby shares much in common with Icon and Pop-II (just asPERL does with SNOBOL), both languages that have found adherents outside the computer science fraternity despite their strong theoretical foundations. Where Ruby differs is that it has a killer application – the Internet. Anyone who has looked at the Rails web application framework can instantly see the potential compared to the slew of ad hoc scripting languages against which it is currently competing, and most of that power comes from the relative ease with which Ruby handles meta-programming. Ruby makes object orientation, functional meta-programming painless for the non-technical user and introduces elegance and beauty into tasks which whilst achieveable in many apparently equivalent languages would require inelegant hacks. In my opinion this is a very good thing because elegant software is in general easier to maintain – something which I’m sure the hardcore of Lisp hackers would recognise.<query> what is ruby used for</query> For me it’s not really a case of Lisp or Ruby being the more powerful language in an absolute sense, but of which is the more powerful tool in the hands of a particular developer looking to use the highest levels of abstraction possible with the minimum level of theoretical knowledge. As an amathematical person I consider Ruby more powerful for me as an individual, even though that may not be the case for many previous commentators. Given the ease with which a non-technical user can gain a good grasp of Ruby I suspect that it has the potential to be to network programming whatBASIC was to the microcomputer revolution of the 1970’s and 1980’s. The speed with which Ruby on Rails is taking off in the web development arena is just the tip of this particular iceberg. So to summarise: Ruby is a powerful language with a syntax that is easy even for non-programmers to get to grips with.<query> what is ruby language</query> It includes concepts to do with block closures, object-orientation and meta-programming which are usually absent from languages accessible to novice programmers and provides idioms for their usage which are easy to remember and use. There are without doubt architectural techniques which can be utilised more easily in Lisp, but as to whether or not those are techniques which are actively useful for general software development is something that I think is open to debate.

More can be said in Lisp’s defence than you say. Macros can be used not just to make lambdas more consize.<query> what is the ruby example</query> If you consider the above expression hard to read, and prefer to read in the order of computation, as in your Ruby example, take a look at this: (stream-2nd-arg ‘(1 2 3) (mapcar (lambda (n) ( n n))) (remove-if (lambda (n) (= (mod n 3) 1)))) Note that mapcar and remove-if have no 2nd argument. Where do they get it from? From the previous computation. The first arg to ‘stream-2nd-arg’ macro is evaluated first. Other args are function calls evaluated after that in turn, and each gets their 2nd argument from the previous call. Simple, concise and readable too. The implementation of stream-2nd-arg macro is left as an excersize to the reader :) nuke edit John Collins said 165 days later: I am so glad I found a guru versed in all 3 of: Ruby, LISP, and functional programming.<query> what is the stream 2nd arg</query> In LISP and Python, I can use the apply function to pass a parameter list to a function declared to accept those parameters and bind them directly to each of the formal parameters in the declaration of the called function.

I don’t mean to flame, but I’ve seen roughly a thousand times more talking about Lisp than the using of it. I’ve always meant to learn Lisp, but I get the sense that I’ll be applying the knowledge more on usenet than on actual programs. I’ve recently discovered Ruby, and of all its amazing strengths ( I’ll put at the top of the list—at least as far as something that you’ll probably see on any open vim session on my workstation these days—is the enumerable module ) nothing quite matches the friendliness and helpfulness of its community.<query> what is lisp used for</query> Ruby seems to be the first language to really get that languages are software and programmers are users.

You have some good points, and I agree that Ruby is the most Lispy language that isn’t actually a Lisp (CL, Scheme, Dylan). But although blocks can get you surprisingly close to macros, they can’t take you all the way there. As you pointed out, the implementation of macro-like code in Ruby tends to be ugly behind the scenes. Ruby’s syntax isn’t regular, and so can’t be operated on with macros. This means you’ve got to shoehorn various abstractions into doing what you want. Instead of processing the code passed to a block as a list and simply transforming it into something else, you have to define the elements of your mini-language as methods in some class.<query> what language is lisp</query> That’s when a combination of Moore’s Law and gross business incompetence killed off half the Lisp companies. Nonetheless, you should probably learn Lisp if you want to take full advantage of Ruby: The bookPractical Common Lisp contains 10 times as much meta-programming advice as all the Ruby documentation I’ve seen, combined. nuke edit William James said 264 days later: Here are some Ruby equivalents of some Lisp examples: (iter (for x in '(-1 2 -10 4)) (finding x maximizing (abs x))) [-1, 2, -10, 4].inject{|a,b| a.abs > b.abs ? a : b} # or [-1, 2, -10, 4].sort_by{|n| n.abs}.last (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 -4 -10 -43 49 49 8934)) (until (= (sqrt 7) x)) (collect x into collection) (finding x maximizing (abs x) into y) (finally (return (list collection y))))<query> what is lisp example</query> (By the way, I don’t think this Lisp will work as advertised. (= (sqrt 7) x) seems wrong.) def maxim a,b; (yield a) > (yield b) ? a : b; end y = 0 [1,2,3,-4,-10,-43,49,49,8934].inject([]){|a,n| break [a,y] if n==49 y = maxim(y,n){|x| x.abs} a << n } nuke edit William James said 265 days later: This version will work properly even if the list doesn’t contain 49; also, the variable y has been eliminated. def maxi a,b; (yield a) > (yield b) ? a : b; end [1,2,3,-4,-10,-43,49,49,8934].inject([[],0]){|a,n| break a if n==49 a[1] = maxi(a[1],n){|x| x.abs} a[0] << n ; a } nuke edit Miquel said 278 days later: I have to say that I work with lisp everyday and it is very powerful.<query> what is the function of lisp</query> I just haven’t got the motivation to make a decent interface to mysql for my web applications. That is why I chose Rails. Oh Well.. However, when the db support arrives, I am going back. nuke edit Pebblestone said 278 days later: Miquel: Try CLSQL, it supports multiple DBs and on multiple lisp implementations. And I just used it in my last project. nuke edit KristofU said 296 days later: I’m a C++ programmer, and was looking for a new language to learn and do stuff more elegantly. Ruby just sucked me right in. There is almost nothing to learn, it’s just there. You can slice and dice and juggle and the result is always a working program. You like for-statements? Well, you can use for-statements.<query> what language is ruby used for</query> You like iterators? Well, you can use iterators. Make object functors or lambda’s, whichever you prefer. Ruby doesn’t force anything upon you, there is time to learn to appreciate the finer features, while still churning out working apps in the meantime. I’ve also briefly tried Haskell, Scheme and Erlang, but I have to say, I couldn’t get anything done. Compared to Ruby, quite an anti-climax. nuke edit taw said 302 days later: You might be interested in RLisp, which is Lisp directly connected to Ruby runtime and very tightly integrated with Ruby. It is very alpha, but can do really cool stuff like HTTP server that uses webrick (from standard Ruby library) and macros. I think even at this early stage it is probably one of the most practical Lisps for scripting-style of programs, due to access to all Ruby libraries.<query> what is ruby lisp</query> The biggest problem right now seems to be culture shock, as RLisp has Ruby/Python-style let (this is the most controversial part, I don’t have any idea why), a “real” object system (based on message passing and everything-is-a-Ruby-object), and lists are arrays (so cdr/cons copy). Enjoy :-) nuke edit Simplicus said 304 days later: Why compare Ruby with Lisp and not with Erlang, Haskell or ML or other FP languages? I find this discussion very fruitful in many aspects. Yet the most interesting part of it for me personally is to what extent Ruby is a functional language? Or using Eric terminology how “functionally dense” Ruby really is? I have no doubts that Lisp and Scheme in particular can be used for functional programming (FP).<query> why is ruby different from lisp</query> Nevertheless both of these languages can be used equally well for non-functional programming also. Now back to my question: Why compare Ruby with Lisp and not with Erlang, Haskell or ML, or other “true” (Haskell) or “more functional” (Erlang, ML) FP languages? I understand that from the above mentioned FP languages only Erlang has no strict types and two others (Haskell and ML) are strict. Nevertheless, I think that we can still compare “functional density” of those with Ruby’s. I have 20+ years of programming experience, starting with DEC PDP-11 Macro Assembler and most of later work inOOP, such as C+ and then Java which I started to play with its first alpha release. That time I liked Java a lot compared to C++. During that “old times” I had also a chance to get to knowCLOS and was charmed with its powerful ideas (lists = code = data, generic functions,MOP, to name a few), uniformity and simplicity.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Unfortunately, that time (and today as well) I couldn’t find a way to do my living working on Lisp or Scheme projects, though I did some work in AI related areas (and learned many other “small” and “big” languages including Prolog) . About three years ago I started to research FP quite seriously, trying to find programming tools (languages) more powerful then Java and otherOOP languages that I could use to implement some of the ideas waiting in silo quite for a long time already. I started with Scheme, then ML and now Haskell which I like most for its clarity and power. In between I am looking at Erlang and Ruby. Returning back to “FP density” Scheme and Lisp lack some powerful constructs that ML and Haskell have and that I find very important for uniformity, clarity, readability and expressiveness of the language.<query> what language is lisp</query> (Mind you, I love them all Haskell, Scheme and Lisp :) These things are: 1) Guards (Haskell) 2) Pattern matching (Haskell, ML, Erlang) 3) List comprehensions (Haskell) Guards example: max :: Int -> Int -> Int max x y | x >=y = x | otherwise = y Example of both pattern matching and comprehensions – quick sort in Haskell is simple as that: qSort :: [Int] -> [Int] qSort [] = [] qSort (x:xs) = qSort [ y | y <-xs, y<=x] ++ [x] ++ qSort [ y | y<-xs, y > x] This code is very close to informal definition of quick sort: “To sort the list take off the head â€˜(x:xs)’ and then split the result in two parts: the first containing the elements no larger then â€˜x’ and the second exceeding â€˜x’.<query> what is quick sort in haskell</query> Sort these two parts and then concatenate â€˜x’ with results of these two sorts” Isn’ it clarity and readability? Isn’t purely functional notation is better then a notaion produced by macros? What Ruby gives as equivalent to Guards, Pattern matching and List comprehensions? I am not even talking about extremely powerful strategy of lazy evaluation that allows Haskell only evaluate a function argument when it is really needed (on demand) to compute the overall result. This in turn makes computations less expensive and allows language to describe infinite data structures. As almost everything else, lazy evaluation can be implemented in Lisp and Scheme. Any ideas how to do this in Ruby? After Haskell, Ruby syntax looks too eclectic for me (foo, @bar, baz :faz => xxx), â€˜blocks’ and â€˜yields’ makes me feel sorry for functions as first class objects, “meta programming” seems for me to be a perfect tool to hide and obscure what is really going on behind the code I see right now (because methods can be added to classes in other source files), etc… Maybe I am totally wrong about Ruby and will drastically change my opinion after more experience with it, we’ll see.<query> what is lazy evaluation in ruby</query> As for this discussion it would be interesting to know what you guys think about: 1) The question I started this message with 2) Why Haskell (and FP in general) is not as widespread as Java, Python & Ruby? And all these sad things are happening in spite of: a. Though not so big but very strong and dedicated community of Haskell developers. b. Constantly growing set of open source Haskell applications, tools and libraries. nuke edit schemer said 320 days later: Simplicus, I would agree that pattern matching and guards are awesome, even in the absense of types. I mainly code in Scheme, but I was absolutely blown away by Monads and lazy evaluation when I tried Haskell. I can’t belive most programmers consider those aspects of Haskell a turn off, both are techniques which I was earlier trying to reinvent while programming in Scheme while not even realizing it.<query> why is haskell not as widely used as java</query> The pervasiveness of Ruby’s OO becomes a hassle here. (Sure, lots of defmacro’s end up being ugly too, but at least they’re conceptually cleaner). And all user-defined languages and structures immediately stand out because they have to be set off with the “do” keyword. There are too many things about Lisp that no other language will ever get unless it is also a Lisp. The ability to move through sexp’s with Emacs keychords is priceless. The simple structure of Lisp and its lack of arbitrary syntax makes it easy to provide good editing support. The whole idea of interactive development rocks. The ability to, in most implementations, compile to native code rocks as well. Lisp is pretty mature, and while there are a few quirks to it, 50 years of existence will go a long way toward making a programming language great.<query> what is lisp used for</query> However, from personal experience, I would have to note that there is no reason why scheme can’t have those features; (There are libraries for pattern matching as you presumed, and there are As for what I think makes scheme less “functionally dense” than Haskell are: Scheme’s mutable define, mutable cons, and non-imperative i/o are what make it less functional than Haskell. Of course, these features that I mentioned aren’t really fundamental properties of the language, both in my opinion are historical cruft that I hope someday will be fixed… On the other hand, I’d love to see a sexpr Haskell. :) As for ruby, I don’t consider it to be “functional,” (although I wouldn’t be surpised if ruby programmers were fond of hofs) because as far as I know, it doesn’t have tail-call optimization.<query> what makes scheme less functional</query> With Common Lisp, even though it doesn’t have tco, every major compiler out there (CMUCL,SBCL, probably also CLisp) optimizes tail calls, so I have no particular problem with CL, assuming a very non-idiomatic style to CL. TCO is a big deal for me, because in Elisp I have to use destructive maps/filters to avoid exceeding the functional call depth, that’s really annoying… nuke edit schemer said 320 days later: Argh. I made some bad typos to my post: I meant lack of non-imperative i/o in my prior statement. Also, I forgot to note several prominent scheme hackers have implemented monads in scheme, though unfortunately there’s no standardized example… Lazy evaluation in scheme is also doable as you mentioned, even though I haven’t yet gottten the srfi for stream-define and friends working properly (apparently the my implementations’ modules are not compatable with it without extra macros) I also don’t grasp why the srfi for memoized streams uses set!<query> what is tco in scheme</query> when it could just use a helper function (but then again, I would say that this is a problem of mutable define in scheme) nuke edit William James said 325 days later: Quicksort in Ruby: def qsort ary return ary if ary == [] pivot = ary[0] left, right = ary[1..-1].partition{|x| x < pivot } qsort( left ) + [pivot] + qsort( right ) end nuke edit memeplex said 325 days later: Lack of community and codebase are strong impediments for every but a few language. Also most new languages are missing a standard ffi which let them easily access c/c+ legacy code, preferable via bindings autogenerated by tools like swig. In this regard, Lisp has cffi, which is a good thing. But anyway, you won’t get too far away without people doing the heavy lifting, all that enormous amount of binding code should be generated, patched and tested.<query> what is the cffi in ruby</query> It seems like the way to go for small communities is to parasite mature and well established runtimes, and to compile to their intermediate binary representation. Of course I’m talking of java and .net /mono/pnet here. They’re doing their thing pretty well, performance is more than acceptable, and taken as intermediate languages (which msil is more than java bytecode) they can even be compiled to native code (take for example gcj). I love scheme programming but I’m also fond of new oo+fp languages, namely scala or nemerle. Because of the reflection capabilities of this cross-language/cross-platform runtimes, binding is far easier than it is for C/C + native stuff. Sometimes it’s just a matter of importing modules and start using them. Admittedly, a generic runtime it’s not the same than a standard library tailored to an specific language.<query> what is msil language</query> But then those standard libraries could be build faster on top of the facilities offered by the runtime, and in case they are still not complete, one can always resort to the generic api, it’s not a cul-de-sac. Also you can easily bind to c/ c++ if you really need it: there are mature swig modules for java and c#, while there aren’t others for a lot of cool, tiny languages. I’m currently programming in bigloo scheme targeting the jvm, and in scala too (they both are able to generate code for the clr also, although support isn’t that mature already). I think it’s the way to go for languages with small communities. And in any case, these intermediate platforms promote code reuse, offer advanced interpretation/compilation techniques (while there could be lack of support for specific techniques, like tail-recursion, that’s a price to pay), powerful development environments, etc etc.<query> what is the difference between java and c++</query> Just how I’m feeling like lately. nuke edit Eric Kidd said 326 days later: Oh, I’m a huge fan of Haskell. The syntax is nice and dense (though occasionally a bit alien), and monads are a remarkably powerful abstraction. There’s a whole class of designs which can be easily expressed with monads (unification, backtracking, transactions, continuations-as-a-library, localized state, modular parsers, and so on). A lot of these designs can’t be implemented cleanly with Lisp macros (unless you write a code-walker, or an entire embedded language). It also seems that monads are most useful when you can have more than one of them, and when you can overload your monadic operations depending on the return type of your function. This is the biggest barrier I’ve found to using monadic code in Scheme.<query> what is monads</query> Haskell is a fairly hard programming language, and I doubt it will ever go mainstream. But it’s by far one of the most interesting languages on the scene, and I learn a lot programming in it. My biggest complaint is the lack of subtyping, which is fixed by O’Haskell. If I had to recommend four languages to learn, I’d recommend Ruby (because it’s so fun), Lisp/Scheme (for the macros), Oz (for unification, concurrent logic and constraints) and Haskell (for monads and for the deeply mathematical style). nuke edit scripting geek said 374 days later: Very interesting and enjoyable discussion! I did LISP and Scheme for a few years in the early 90s, doing AI at Berkeley. Looking back over that code some years later, just for fun, I was struck by the total impenetrability of my earlierLISP excretions.<query> what language do you learn to code in haskell</query> The resulting tangle of sexp was so nasty, I would have opted for ritual seppuku if required to decipher the stuff. But that’s just me and my substandardLISP code. On another tangent.. I’m finding the impassioned arguments about language properties very interesting, but ultimately somewhat irrelevant, at least insofar as productivity is concerned. I think that nowadays the breadth and quality of the available open source libraries is a much larger factor in the appeal of a language as a useful tool than are the theoretical upper limits of its expressive capability. Learning to live with somewhat clunky metaprogramming facilities as opposed to super-powerful macros is infinitely easier, I think, than lacking libraries for half the stuff you need done on a daily basis. It sounds as though LISP is still far behind the Python/Ruby camps insofar as that’s concerned, and for this reason alone I wouldn’t give it another look at this time.<query> what is the purpose of lisp</query> And, at least in my case, I learned that power of program-as-AST that’s so nice for computers is not so good for human comprehension, as we do not make good recursive tree evaluators. Beyond a modest level of nesting and layering, things start to look very nasty indeed. Python/Ruby on the other hand are very readable, with plenty of useful idioms captured by grammar or sugar, and have APIs to easily interact with just about everything. With tools such as these, I alone can replace a small department of C programmers, and that’s very appealing. nuke edit Chris Rathman said 406 days later: Since the topic is a comparison between Ruby and Lisp (and Simplicus expressed an interest in comparing Ruby with Haskell or ML or other FP languages), I thought I’d mention my pet project to translate theSICP examples into these languages. http://www.codepoetics.com/wiki/index.php?title=Topics:SICP_in_other_languages<query> what language is python compared to ruby</query> I’ve still got a lot to learn about Ruby, but in translating the first chapter and a half the main quirks I had with Ruby were (1) it’s lack of Tail Call Optimization – an attibute shared with Python and JavaScript (many in the Lisp community consider the lack ofTCO to be a bug); and (2) the distinction between named and anonymous functions. As far as I can tell, you can curry lambdas, but you can’t curry named functions – Erlang works this way as well. nuke edit gar37bic said 407 days later: This is a great discussion, and has been very informative for me. I’m thinking about which language I want to tackle next, primarily for research into areas such as neural networks. In my real life, I spend a lot of time writing heuristic filters based on regular expressions – (typically usingPCRE: ‘perl-compatible regex’, though I don’t use Perl) – to do things like parse, filter, sanitize and combine multiple legacy datasets into one ‘canonical’ set.<query> what language can you curry lambdas</query> I guess what bothers me about Ruby is its quirks. That might sound crazy, since it’s well-known that Common Lisp has more than its share of historical cruft. But I really cannot get my mind back into the framework of arbitrary syntax. It is ultimately useless. It prevents you from writing macros, it prevents editors from having flawless support for your language, and it prevents you from expressing yourself as concisely as you need to. Your lambda sample is indeed shorter in Ruby than in Lisp. But Ruby’s OO is not quite so clean in this situation: (defmethod sum-children ((c item)) (loop for child in (children-of item) sum (height-of child))) (mapcar #'sum-children list-o-children) I don’t think that can be done quite so easily in Ruby.<query> what is ruby lambda</query> This often requires running other programs to pre-sort incoming data streams, and then maintaining arrays of match-probability scores for possible matches. How would these languages address problems such as these? nuke edit gar37bic said 407 days later: I also often ‘scrape’ (with permission) HTML, SQL, CVS, PDF, DOC and other files off the net, to generate input data for our company’s data mining operation, for example corporate federal andSEC filings. And right now I’m scripting OpenOffice to do file format conversions to .DOC … nuke edit Eric Kidd said 407 days later: Chris Rathman: I thought I’d mention my pet project to translate theSICP examples into these languages. Oh, that’s really cool. Thanks for the link! nuke edit David A. Wheeler said 407 days later: One problem with traditional Lisp notation is that it’s fairly hard to read—and as programs get bigger, it gets worse.<query> what is the problem with lisp notation</query> It’s especially nasty when you use operators that are traditionally infix operators, e.g., (+ 3 (* 2 3)) may be a regular syntax, but even Graham admits it’s awkward. I’ve developed a notation called “sweet-expressions” which I think are easier to read. A sweet-expression readers can read normal s-expressions, but can also accept other formats. It still works with all the macro constructs, etc., of Lispy languages.

In my opinion, the syntax of Lisp seemed to be more in tune with my liking than Ruby’s. I think I’ll take the plunge with Lisp and see where Ruby fits in later. Good job on the discussion people! nuke edit Charlie Lindahl said 740 days later: I worked for a number of years on LISP machines at Texas Instruments in the 80s One of my points is : it’s the environment. Not just the IDE; in LISP and Smalltalk environmentsEVERYTYHING is written in the language in question/use (with the exception of machine-specific low-level stuff required to talk to theOS / machine architecture). What this means (not great for a general business case, but incredible for learning and expressive power) is that I can actually take apart / customize / study the underlying OS and/or tools.<query> what language is lisp</query> So, for example, say you don’t like the way EMACS works. Go grab the source (a keystroke away inLISP IDEs) and go plowing through it with the IDEs/debuggers and rewrite it to your specifications. I learned the Macintosh Toolbox structure by running Lisp on the Mac and dissecting the window data structures (on the fly / realtime ) without needing to have source code. Once Ruby gets to the point of this kind of power in the environment, inspection, and debugging it’ll be amazingly powerful. Quite good now from what I’ve seen so far.

Also, blocks are little more than callable code. You can try to impose some structure on them by defining appropriate methods and evaluating the block in a special context, but this is not the same as the code transformation macros provide. You cannot, for instance, selectively evaluate different expressions in different contexts. Consider: (let ((x 45)) (defclass foo () ((name :initform x)))) That will work because defclass will expand the initform (and only the initform!) into a lambda-expression and thus close over the x variable; nothing else will be evaluated in that context.<query> how to use def class in java</query> It’s also important to notice that defclass does not look any different than let, even though defclass is simply a macro, and let is a built-in special form. I will clearly go on for days unless I stop now. I was about to write about how let’s rock because you can limit a variable’s scope with absolute precision (not possible in Ruby) and then about how Marco Baringer implemented continuations in straight Lisp. To sum up: yes, Ruby is not that bad (maybe even “acceptable”) but Lisp owns. nuke edit Eric said about 7 hours later: Ruby’s most frustrating quirks, from a LISP perspective, tend to involve its scoping rules. Methods, variables and constants each have subtly different behavior. And as for block locals, even Matz admits that they’re pretty broken.<query> is ruby good for lisp</query> Let’s consider a Ruby version of LET: def let(*args) yield *args end let(1,2,3) {|x,y,z| z } This does exactly what you want if the variables are unbound: It introduces a new scope with three local variables. On the other hand, if any of the variables were previously bound, Ruby clobbers the existing bindings. Nasty. The biggest limitation of trading LISP’s compile-time macro expansion for Ruby’s metaclass hackery is launch time. Rails works around this using FCGI and on-demand class loading. These headaches aside, I’ve had very good luck porting LISP macros to Ruby. At this point, I could probably reimplement about half of the macros in On LISP without much trouble. Another quarter could be brute-forced using ParseTree, but that’s (arguably) cheating. I’ll talk more about these techniques in the coming months.<query> what is the ruby macro for lisp</query> nuke edit Anonymous said about 7 hours later: Hi. I’ll just assume here you always meant Common Lisp when you wrote LISP(it isn’t capitalised there, just like PERL and JAVA aren’t right). Before answering this question, we should decide what makes LISP so powerful. Paul Graham has written eloquently aboutLISP’s virtues. But, for the sake of argument, I’d like to boil them down to two things: LISP is a dense functional language. LISP has programmatic macros. Sorry to say, but that doesn’t reflect reality. If those were the two main reasons to use Common Lisp, most people probably wouldn’t. Incidentally, Paul Graham’s Common Lisp style is definitely atypical (google for “Graham Crackers”). His Scheme background/affection certainly shows, and he usually doesn’t mention all the other things that make Common Lisp so useful (unlike in Scheme, avoiding side-effects and using recursion instead of iteration in Common Lisp is rather rare).<query> why use lisp</query> As it turns out, Ruby compares well as a functional language, and it fakes macros better than I’d thought. Ruby is a denser functional language than LISP A dense language lets you say things concisely, without obfuscation. You can see more of your program in one glance, and there aren’t as many places for bugs to hide. Beyond a certain point, the only way to make programs denser is to use more powerful abstractions. One particularly powerful abstraction is lambda. Using lambda, you can create a new function on the fly, pass it to other functions, and even store it for later use. For example, if you wanted to double each number in a list, you might write: (mapcar (lambda (n) (* n 2)) mylist) mapcar creates a new list by transforming each element of mylist.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> Despite the roots, Common Lisp isn’t much of a “functional” language. It has all the necessary features, but imperative constructs andOOP play a major role in the language. It’s not Common Lisp if it doesn’t have the Common Lisp Object System; it also wouldn’t be anywhere as powerful without the condition system and all the other things (full numeric tower; the type system; etc.). I have no doubt that Ruby might match CL in the functional department, but that won’t get you very far. Common Lisp has come a long way, and even though many people seem to reduce it to macros and higher-order functions, that view does certainly not reflect the way people use it in reality—it’s not very attractive or particularly useful (in comparison) when reduced to that set of features.<query> what is common lisp</query> 2005, I’d think long and hard before choosing LISP over Ruby. I’d probably only do it if I needed optimized code, or macros which acted as full-fledged compilers. I’m sure Ruby is a good choice, but if you’re using Lisp just for the macros, you’ve probably missed all theinteresting features… (In case you’re curious, Practical Common Lisp is a good, freely available book that covers a lot more ground than just macros and higher-order functions) nuke edit null said about 9 hours later: You guys don’t understand…your precious little languages is a moving target. You’ll never write code that’ll survive 20 years with them. If all you’re doing is web pages, I suppose that’s all right. But only to a point where data integration and AI comes to the web.

I’ve been coming at Ruby as a long-time Java guy with a now and again interest inLISP and wandering what theLISP community thinks of Ruby. I love it as a step up from Java and I’ve been thinking that it is reasonably close toLISP, at least in power (not in language design). However, I wanted to get a deeper undestanding of the (practical) differences. Also, I’ve taken the pill that allows me to love the “arbitrary syntax” mentioned by ‘bill a’ above.<query> what is ruby ruby</query> I find it hard to convince others who have thePERL vs. Python dualing philosophies in mind and stand on the Python (/Java) side, but as a way to implement Domain Specific Languages, I think Ruby’s open syntax shines. Where I’ve had a question is on the following issue: If the additional syntax options are layered on top of a solid consistant core (like withLISP), it seems to be solid advantage, perhaps even outshining the venerableLISP in this respect. (Specifically, I’m thinking of Executable DSLs.) So commentary here regarding the fundamental soundness and consistancy of the Ruby language vsLISP is especially interesting and appreciated. nuke edit bill a said about 13 hours later: OK, guys….you can say whatever you’d like about Lisp, but please, please, please stop capitalizing it. It’s Lisp, notLISP.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> nuke edit jimmy said about 13 hours later: Thanks, Bill. That was bugging me too. nuke edit Smalltalking with a Lisp said about 13 hours later: Ruby was inspired mainly by Smalltalk and Lisp. If you really want your hair blown back, check them out. Ruby and Python are gateway languages to the above. nuke edit bill a said about 14 hours later: I am curious how much of Ruby comes from Lisp. I would tend to think that people who are familiar with Lisp do not go around writing languages. :) nuke edit Unordinary Programmer said about 14 hours later: “Some may say Ruby is a bad rip-off of Lisp or Smalltalk, and I admit that. But it is nicer to ordinary people.” - Matz, LL2 nuke edit Anonymous Coward said about 16 hours later: Hmm.<query> what language is ruby based on</query> Lisp macros are far more powerful than the trivial use cases you’ve listed. I could give a lot of examples here, but just ask yourself: why is most of the programming community so fond with “Design Patterns”, while the Lisp community generally isn’t? Well, that’s because patterns are nothing but high-level specifications for code being rewritten again and again and again. The Lisp approach is to create some macros and auxiliary functions that actually implement the pattern, thus extending the language capabilities and avoiding continuous reinvention of the wheel. It has happened for object orientation (CLOS anyone?), aspect-oriented programming, OO<->SQL mapping… All without touching the basic language syntax and implementations. Ruby features may compete in some specific cases, but I bet that the same consideration would apply for other languages too.<query> what is lisp pattern</query> Finally, regarding the Lisp libraries: it’s true that the language specs are full of historical cruft (e.g. mandatory support for the now-dead versioning filesystems), and lack things like standard sockets. But it’s also true that there’s a good amount of free (as in freedom) libraries that fill the gap. Have a tour on http://cliki.net/ for an appetizer. nuke edit Beowulf said about 16 hours later: I’ve made a relatively lengthy response to the posts here on my blog. http://zifus.blogspot.com/2005/12/power-vs-popularity.html You may not agree with my reasoning, but realize this is the reasoning process I went through when I decided to build my system in Rails instead of Lisp. Realize that I love Lisp and I would have used it if I could’ve focused on solving my actual problems rather than trying to integrate various frameworks together and struggling to get it all working as a cohesive whole.<query> what is lisp used for</query> The biggest reason I abandoned Java and C# is that I wanted to focus on my problem, and not fight with getting the language and framework to do what I want. This is coming from a lover of Lisp, imagine what someone who either isn’t a fan of the language or doesn’t even know it exists is thinking. nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said about 20 hours later: Ruby’s creator is outspokenly influenced by Lisp and Smalltalk, yet Ruby’s success is supposed to be a terrible thing to Lisp users? Particularly since Smalltalk’s creator also speaks of his influence and admiration of Lisp? ;) I (perhaps badly) recall that things in motion tend to have lower friction coefficients. If Ruby’s technical advantages get the mainstream moving, great. I think this is a more reasoned article than I remember seeing from the Java and Python worlds.<query> why was ruby created</query> The transformation, in this case, could be read as “for each valuen, multiply n by two.” In JavaScript, you’d writelambda as function, which is perhaps a bit clearer: map(function (n) { return n*2 }, mylist) Of course, this is only a hint of what you can do with lambda. Languages which favor this style of programming are calledfunctional languages, because they work with functions. A dense functional language can be very concise indeed, and quite clear once you learn to read it. How does Ruby stack up against LISP for functional programming? Let’s consider Paul Graham’scanonical example, a function which creates an accumulator: (defun foo (n) (lambda (i) (incf n i))) This code is marginally shorter in Ruby, and the notation will be more familiar to C hackers: def foo(n) lambda {|i| n+=i} end acc = foo 3 acc.call(1) # --> 4 acc.call(10) # --> 14 acc.call(0) # --> 14 But there’s an interesting special case in Ruby which saves us even more typing.<query> what is lambda in ruby</query> However, I think it has two honest errors. For one thing, I wouldn’t call Common Lisp a functional language, if by that we mean it is biased towards recursion over other techniques. I use iteration heavily; Lisp’sLOOP macro is pretty impressive in this regard, and there are even more powerful 3rd party iteration constructs. Perhaps Rubists focus on functions because they correctly find a lot of power in them, but then they’re viewing Lisp through Ruby-colored glasses. Second, as for plain macros, these are just functions which (at some time like “compiletime”) take code and return code. They take a sexp and return a sexp. What’s the purpose? Usually expressiveness. Readability. Since they can use other aspects of the language like dynamic scope, they multiply the expressive power of the language.<query> what is lisp macro</query> But they must be used tastefully, as power requires justification. Since I don’t write lambdas much in the first place, my macro usage certainly ain’t to save effort typing lambda. ;) Completely orthogonal concepts. nuke edit Anonymous (again) said about 21 hours later: From Eric: That said, if your Common Lisp style doesn’t rely heavily on macros, you’re missing out on half the fun, not to mention your number one sales pitch. Ok, I agree with that; my initial response may have been a little rash :-) My point remains, though, I’d say that more of half of the fun comes from all the other parts often not mentioned. Macrosare an essential part, but just one of many. To Beowulf: It sounds to me like you are playing the bitter ex-martyr yourself (no offense intended) there.<query> why do you use macros in common lisp</query> Multiple commercial Lisp vendors are doing just fine, even though their implementations arenot cheap and even though there are various actively developed high-quality open-source implementations. That alone shows that the market exists. As David Thornley put it, “Lisp doesn’t look any deader than usual to me”, and all the people saying it the opposite won’t change that (funny, back when I used FreeBSD, “FreeBSD is dead” was the typical (periodically occuring) outcry of many not-users. I guess it’s not particular to Lisp after all). I agree that it isn’t as widely used for open-source software as many contemporary languages are, but it is used surprisingly often once you look further; in particular, the harder the problems you’re solving, the more it seems to be used. The nature of most free Lisp implementations tends to favour long-running programs (they don’t focus on small initial memory footprints or delivering small binaries), and the benefits of the language help you more the harder your problems get—abstractions scale (in dealing with the complexity of your program), syntactic shortcuts don’t.<query> why is lisp used</query> I suspect that this is also why most/many Lispers don’t care too much about getting a shorter syntax for (lambda (...) ...): It simply doesn’t win you much (in terms of shorter code size) in non-trivial programs; other factors become much, much more important. (This is also why micro-benchmarks are usually not representative unless you write fibonacci or factorial programs all day) You must occupy a niche if you will [...] No, (in my humble opinion) the whole power of Common Lisp comes exactly from the fact that itdoesn’t focus on niches. It focuses on power. If you want to occupy a niche, you can easily extend Common Lisp to do that (I think it’s called “writing your ownDSL” nowadays :-); Prolog-in-Lisp, Lisa, AllegroCache and AspectL are just a few examples of that (all implemented as normal libraries,IIRC).<query> what is the power of common lisp</query> I’m certain that Common Lisp couldn’t have survived for this long weren’t it so extensible: Perl, Python, Java, they and most other new languages all reinvent themselves every other year, and I’m sure they would have been succeeded by “competing” languages by now if they didn’t — most niches are moving targets and the competition doesn’t sleep. The Common Lispstandard, in comparison, has not changed for a long time and probably won’t (need to) anytime soon. Sure, that means that writing a simple webpage inPHP may be simpler; Perl is certainly more comfortable to use for a quick one-liner; Erlang should beat Common Lisp easily in the domain Erlang was created for, and so on. Where Common Lisp shines, however, is when your problem isnot covered by a typical niche. It shines when your problem is hard and your requirements aren’t simple, when you actually can make use of the advanced features.<query> what is common lisp</query> If another language has a library/framework that does just what you want to do, and Common Lisp doesn’t, why use Common Lisp, anyway? I think using one language for everything is usually a bad sign (lack of flexibility on part of the developer), not a good one (no language is best at everything, and I never understood people who think that. Also, life would be terribly boring if that were so). It’s simply not true that people didn’t/don’t write frameworks in Common Lisp, but I suspect that what you consider a framework is usually just called a library in Common Lisp. If you think it is dead in the commercial world, franz.com (one commercial Lisp vendor) alone has more than enough success stories/impressive products to prove that wrong (I guess Lord of the Rings (the movie), Jak and Dexter and Orbitz are typical modern examples).<query> why use common lisp</query> cliki.net / lispwire.com have plenty of links to open-source libraries/software. I’ll close with a quote from Kent Pitman: “…Please don’t assume Lisp is only useful for Animation and Graphics, AI, Bioinformatics,B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining, EDA/Semiconductor applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent Agents, Knowledge Management, MechanicalCAD , Modeling and Simulation, Natural Language, Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling, Telecom, and Web Authoring just because these are the only things they happened to list.” nuke edit Eric said about 22 hours later: Bill, the lowercase spelling “Lisp” is certainly correct for Common Lisp (and I’ve fixed it in the main article—thanks!). The uppercase spelling, however, has along and respectable history. The new way certainlyis easier on the eyes, but my LISP teachers were a bit old-school, and I haven’t overcome my nostalgia yet. :-)<query> what is lisp used for</query> As for your query about how often LISP hackers write new languages: Oddly enough, it’s abit of an obsession. Yeah, I know, it makes no sense. But H. sapiens always did tend to mess with perfection. Tayssir, I would be delighted if Ruby encouraged programmers to take a good look atLISP (and SmallTalk). And Ruby is certainly good news for metaprogramming in general. Maybe we’ll finally stop hearing about macros being “too powerful,” a personal peeve of mine. nuke edit Ben said 1 day later: Nice article. I’m not a Ruby user but I will say one language feature it has which Common Lisp doesn’t—first class continuations. Also, given the success which Python has had in porting to the CLR, has anyone seriously thought about making a Lisp-like language for .Net?<query> what language is ruby</query> I mean, there are some things out there, but they seem either not well supported or rather ML-like (which is fine but not exactly like Lisp.) nuke edit Joku said 1 day later: The article didn’t really compare how things could be done in Python, even though it started from the premise that Ruby might be more powerful. Not really a surprise though, because it would’ve turned out that Python code can be nearly identical in complexity to Ruby code (sometimes slightly more complex, sometimes slightly less). And neither Ruby nor Python come close to providing the same power as macros in Lisps. I don’t think you gave any reason to consider Ruby over Python. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Eric, Sure, many years ago “LISP” was the correct rendition, but I don’t think that’s been the case for quite some time.<query> which is better python or ruby</query> Incidentally, all of those examples you pointed out (Dylan, Scheme, Goo, Logo) are all dialects of Lisp. :-) nuke edit Anonymous Coward said 1 day later: About continuations in Lisp: here’s an example of a language extensions provided by using macros. Maybe Common Lisp doesn’t have “native” continuations because they can be created in several ways. See “On Lisp” by Paul Graham for an example (the book is downloadable from his website, if you don’t want to spend money). Maybe they are not syntactically as nice as the Scheme built-in continuations, but for practical pourposes they are just “good enough”. And more syntactic sugar is always available by using some macro magic. nuke edit First Rest said 1 day later: This article sounds like it was written for folks who really want to use Lisp, but have chosen Ruby because all the cool kids are using it and want to reasonably justify an emotional decision.<query> what is the language extension for lisp</query> Consider a (very silly) function which takes alambda as an argument: ;; Call 'fn' once for each natural number. (defun each-natural-number (fn) (loop for n from 1 do (funcall fn n))) ;; Print 1, 2, 3... (each-natural-number (lambda (n) (format t ""~D~%"" n))) Now, we could write the same function in Ruby: def each_natural_number(fn) n = 0 loop { fn.call(n += 1) } end each_natural_number(lambda {|n| puts n }) But we can do better. Let’s get rid of lambda and fn using yield: def each_natural_number n = 0 loop { yield n += 1 } end each_natural_number {|n| puts n } Yes, yield is a special-purpose hack, and yes, it only works for functions which take a singlelambda.<query> how to use lambda in ruby</query> Lisp has been around a long time and has watched other, more popular languages attempt to catch up to it. Here’s a clue: they still haven’t. Figuring that out involves a difficult learning process that challenges most of the things you have learned and involves looking at things in an entirely new way. If you want to learn a language that can change with the times and incorporate whatever latest fad the programming cool kids have to offer, Lisp is the choice. Lisp is the red pill. One question to ask one of the other commenters (who put his comments on a blog that doesn’t allow anonymous posting) that mentioned the small Lisp community: If everyone does like you did and decide to move on, how would the community ever grow? Low hanging fruit is so much easier to pick. nuke edit Lisp + Python = Lython said 1 day later: What about a sexpr-based language built on top of Python, that generates Python bytecode, can access Python libraries and even supports macros?<query> what language is lisp</query> http://lemonodor.com/archives/000648.html (Ok, it’s just a prototype, but here’s my 2c about the Ruby vs Python vs Lisp issue). nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: It’s true, Joku, that Python metaprogramming has become more common recently, using techniques very similar to those popular in the Ruby world. This is a good thing, and deserves broader notice. Guido, however, has never been much a fan of functional programming, and has stated (PDF, page 4) that he doesn’t like lambda, map, filter, reduce, and similar constructs. Normally, this isn’t a problem, because Python has slick list comprehensions: [ n*n for n in [1,2,3] if (n*n)%3!=1 ] In a lot of common cases, list comprehensions will look better than either the Ruby orLISP examples above.<query> what is python metaprogramming</query> But there’s an underlying problem: List comprehensions are a special-purpose feature, and I can’t use the same mechanisms for building myown domain languages. And since Python’s lambda is very limited, it generally won’t help much. Effectively, Python allows me to create new kinds of definitions (by hacking metaclasses), but it doesn’t allow me to define new control constructs. Normally, this doesn’t matter much, but it’s a nuisance if you’re trying to build something likeRake. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: One big difference between Lisp and Ruby is that Ruby gets its dynamicity and its metaprogramming capabilities by doing a lot of code evaluation at runtime. To people who aren’t familiar with Lisp, it might seem that this is the only way to do it. So for instance in Lisp, I might write a macro to define part of a domain-specific language.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> That macro is then expanded into other code at compile-time, and that’s all there is to it. Ruby, on the other hand, takes a much more runtime-centric approach; instead of transforming code, I just have to make sure that a given block is evaluated in a context where the methods it calls can be accessed. So Ruby can’t make many assumptions about code it reads until that code is actually running. The two approaches have advantages and disadvantages, but I (of course ;-) find Lisp’s approach cleaner. It means that the compiler can warn about calling undefined functions, and that development environments can easily do things like locate code definitions. With Ruby’s approach, in general the semantics of any given snippet of code can only be determined at runtime. To be sure, Lisp does have an eval function, but it doesn’t get used much at all outside of Lisp itself.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> This is a good thing. When I was using Ruby, I was sometimes frustrated about this situation – that all decisions about code are made at the last possible minute. Of course, this lets you do things like method_missing and so on, but I have yet to miss that (no pun intended) since switching to Lisp. I don’t mean to suggest that everything in Lisp must be statically prepared (as in C or Java), only that in general Lisp takes a different approach to dynamicity. Just another point to keep in mind. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Sweet! Lython’s definitely a slick hack, and—judging from the sample code—the author noticed that Python’s bytecode is actually moreLISP-like than its official syntax. Python’s if statement really is an expression; the parser just refuses to nest it.<query> what is lisp used for</query> In general, thePython Language Services are a pretty promising framework for implementing a macro system; somebody just needs to roll up their sleeves and make it happen. Bill, you’re absolutely right about LISP and compile-time versus runtime performance. Exhibit A: Ruby on Rails takes a couple of seconds to launch a new server process. With a good compiler,LISP could do the same thing as fast as the OS could read pages into memory. The long-term trends probably favor the LISP (or even Scheme) approach, mostly for reasons ofIDE support and better compile-time checking. The Ruby approach is actually dangerous if your team doesn’t maintain unit tests. nuke edit Beowulf said 1 day later: First Rest, I enabled anonymous comments, I didn’t realize you had to turn that on. :(<query> what is lisp framework</query> I agree with you that Low hanging fruit is easier to pick, which was exactly why I chose Rails for my system. That doesn’t mean I’ve moved on though, rather it means for this system at this time, I didn’t feel like Lisp was the right choice. As someone else mentioned, increasing popularity of Ruby is a good thing for Lisp. Anything that gets people looking at languages more powerful than the Java/C/C++ paradigm is a good thing for Lisp. Eric, my point wasn’t that Lisp should become a niche language. Although in most people’s mind Lisp alreadyis a niche language, it’s the AI language to them. I was suggesting that Lisp needs to find a new place to occupy in people’s minds in order to increase in popularity. The best way to do that imho is to create a shiny new object (ala Rails) for people to play with and promote the heck out of it.<query> why is lisp a niche language</query> Lol, nice retort with the bitter ex-martyr. It made me laugh if nothing else. :-p. I’ve followed and have been involved in numerous Lisp is better than language “x” discussions. Everyone that I have seen devolves into the all too familiar battle of syntax. I just think that people won’t switch languages because the solution to summing children is better in Lisp. I think that misses the point entirely. People are after real world, tangible benefits. Little 3 and 5 line snippets of code simply do not show the actual power and expressiveness of Lisp. Most people cannot extrapolate a 3 line snippet into a real system. I think there is great news that Rails is what is driving adoption of Ruby. It serves to illustrate that people can and will pick up a new language, even an obscure one with relatively wonky syntax.<query> why is lisp better than ruby</query> nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Beowulf, I don’t think I ever said the solution to summing children was a reason to switch to Lisp. I was countering Eric’s assertion that Ruby is more “functional” and “functionally dense” than Lisp. Of course it “misses the point entirely” if that’s how you’re going to interpret it. Real-word, tangible benefits? OK, here you are: - macros give you the power to increase the readablility, concision, and correctness of code. Consider theLOOP and ITERATE macros. Common patterns of looping are expressed withamazing simplicity simply because LOOP and ITERATE can perform code transformations. For instance, let’s say you want to loop over the elements in a sequence and return the one with the highest absolute value: (iter (for x in seq) (finding x maximizing (abs x))) I think that’s fancy.<query> what is the benefit of using a macro in ruby</query> And when you consider that the ITER form is going to expand into wicked-fast code at compile-time (and then be compiled to machine code, in someLISP implementations), you realize that you’ve just gotten a powerful abstraction and increased readabilityfor free . No runtime efficiency or spacecompletely is wasted with this construct, becauseITERATE has efficient idioms to transform common looping patterns into damn fast code. Directly using the faster code would mean a huge loss in readability and maintainability – with Lisp macros, I don’t have to worry about it. For the curious, the macroexpansion for thatITER form is at the bottom of this common. For more macros, take a look at Peter Seibel’s book Practical Common Lisp ( available free at http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book). In one of the final chapters he builds a binary file parsing system that’s plain amazing – and he does it with macros.<query> what is the purpose of a lisp macro</query> But in heavily functional code,yield buys us a lot. Compare: [1,2,3].map {|n| n*n }.reject {|n| n%3==1 } (remove-if (lambda (n) (= (mod n 3) 1)) (mapcar (lambda (n) (* n n)) '(1 2 3))) In a large program, the difference adds up. (In LISP’s defense, it’s possible to write a reader macro which makeslambda more concise. But this is rarely done.) Ruby gives you about 80% of what you want from macros At this point, the LISP hackers are saying, “A good syntax for lambda is nice, but what about macros?” And this is a good question. LISP macros are functions that: Run in the compiler, and Transform custom syntax into raw LISP.<query> what is lambda in ruby</query> Earlier in the book, he writes a test framework in something like 26 lines – using macros too. Here is a sample of the code used to parseID3 tags in MP3’s: (define-tagged-binary-class id3-tag () ((identifier (iso-8859-1-string :length 3)) (major-version u1) (revision u1) (flags u1) (size id3-tag-size)) (:dispatch (ecase major-version (2 'id3v2.2-tag) (3 'id3v2.3-tag)))) It specifices the types and order of the data to be read from the file, and then passes control to another binary-class based on the value of major-version – and even automatically throws an error if the major-version is invalid.<query> what is id3 tag</query> - interactive development. If you haven’t used this, you’re missing out. Most languages are about writing lines of code, feeding them to either an interpreter or a compiler, and then watching what happens. In Lisp, development is always done live and interactively. You write functions in files and then send them to a Lisp image. You develop each component of your system one by one and test it live. There is no compile-run-debug cycle – there isn’t even an interpret-debug cycle. It’s more like a write-test cycle. Interactive development also means you have access to your running system. Not sure what parameters a fucntion takes? Start typing “(func ” and the Lisp environment will remind you what arguments can legally follow that. Want information on an object you’re playing with?<query> what is lisp interactive development</query> Type “(inspect x)” and an interactive, recursive inspector will let you walk through it, even making changes as you go. Once you get your program working, you refactor a little, do some benchmarks, take advantage of Lisp’s completely optional type system to speed up bottlenecks, and sit back and admire your work. - the condition/restart system. In most languages, there is not much that can be done after an exception is raised. Log it, send it to the user, end the program. In Lisp, an error can berestarted. For instance, in the UncommonWeb framework, when you browse to aURL and an error is signaled, you get the backtrace in your environment. You can now make changes to your code, recompile it, and then invoke theRESTART-REQUEST restart. UCW starts processing your request from the beginning, and the browser gets the result of running your latest, changed code.<query> what is the lisp method for restarting a program</query> - regular syntax. In Lisp, all forms can be broken down into (operator [args]). There is nothing else. This means that I can write macros, but it also means that editors can do really neat things with code, because Lisp is regular. I can move up, down, forward, backward, into, and out of lists with Emacs keychords. This might be difficult to appreciate until you’ve tried it, but I really recommend it. Refactoring code becomes trivial when you can treat control structures as a single entity and cut and paste them. - almost 50 years of use and development. Lisp has survived longer than every language exceptFORTRAN. It survived C, C++, Ada, COBOL, and it will survive Java and Ruby. It is, to borrow Paul Graham’s term, “the hundred-year language.” - more!<query> what is lisp used for</query> All of this said, I ought to admit that I do use Ruby and Rails in all of my professional projects. This is not because I don’t think Lisp is ready, but simply because I hadn’t learned Lisp when I started these projects. I now regret that, and my next web application will be in Lisp. As promised, here is the crazy but efficient expansion of the ITERATE form above: (LET* ((#:LIST6 NIL) (X NIL) (#:TEMP7 NIL) (#:RESULT5 NIL) (#:MAX8 NIL) (#:FIRST-TIME9 T)) (BLOCK NIL (TAGBODY (SETQ #:LIST6 SEQ) LOOP-TOP-NIL (IF (ATOM #:LIST6) (GO LOOP-END-NIL)) (SETQ X (CAR #:LIST6))<query> what is the lisp extension</query> (SETQ #:LIST6 (CDR #:LIST6)) (SETQ #:TEMP7 (SQRT X)) (COND (#:FIRST-TIME9 (SETQ #:FIRST-TIME9 NIL) (SETQ #:MAX8 #:TEMP7) (SETQ #:RESULT5 X)) (T (COND ([snipped to prevent overflow -ed.]) (T #:RESULT5)))) (GO LOOP-TOP-NIL) LOOP-END-NIL) #:RESULT5)) - Bill (who is heartily enjoying this discussion) nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Ruby is more than just a dynamic or scripting language. But feel free to snob it. More “Rails-like” projects are on the way. nuke edit First Rest said 1 day later: Lisp lets YOU be Gosling or Matz or Guido.<query> what is ruby used for</query> If you want to extend the language, it’s possible: “DOLIST is similar to Perl’s foreach or Python’s for. Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the “enhanced” for loop in Java 1.5, as part ofJSR-201. Notice what a difference macros make. A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern. A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language. Then Sun has to publish aJSR and convene an industry-wide “expert group” to hash everything out. That process—according to Sun—takes an average of 18 months. After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature. And even once the Java programmer’s favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can’t use the new feature until they’re allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java.<query> what is the difference between java and lisp</query> So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.” —Peter Siebel from Practial Common Lisp nuke edit Garrett said 1 day later: Thanks Bill. That’s very helpful stuff. nuke edit null said 1 day later: Some things not mentioned: meta-object protocol; sexpr (code is data, data is code); for commercial lisps, amazing IDEs. Schemes also have advantages: smaller language – philosophy is move the rest of code to libraries; free near-C fast compilers (Bigloo) (free Schemes have better IDEs than Lisp); possibility prototype algorithms with call/cc and finally translating to efficient iterative algorithms in imperative languages (like C). A final example: look at the 2 open source Computer Algebra Systems written in Common Lisp available as Open Source: 1) Axiom – originally fromIBM Thomas Watson Research Center; 2) Maxima – originally Department of Energy (US).<query> what is the advantage of common lisp</query> This is software written in the 70s. You can’t write software that lasts so long with a language that is a moving target. This is the kind of survival and complex domain which shows the power of Lisp. All these scripting languages are really about people experimenting with language syntax. This is nice, but look at it for what it is. Additionally, almost none of those languages have any theory attached to them. Lisp has (lambda calculus), Smalltalk has (Actors), ML has (type theory). This garantees good, lasting design. Take a look at Perl6 for an example of extreme design experiment. Where it’s going, nobody knows, but – hey! – they’re using Haskell in the implementation (I always thought Perl people were smart). Lisp was very expensive and demanding of hardware in the 70s and 80s.<query> what language is lisp</query> This is not so anymore. There is no great shiny free LispIDE (yet), but at least one vendor sells a good one for a relatively good price. Surely, this can’t keep people from using lisp, since people have taken to relatively “rough” stuff like Perl. By the way, there’s a great Perl book called Higher Order Perl that is really about learning a lot of techniques from Lisp and applying to Perl. I bet a lot of them could be applied to Ruby. All these scripting languages do is create a problem and sell you a solution. But to be fair, scripting languages empowered programmers like Lisp had not (“batteries included”, etc). I think the problem with Common Lisp and Smalltalk is the size of the stuff you have to learn, syntax-wise.<query> what scripting language is used for ruby</query> The most common use of LISP macros is to avoid typing lambda quite so much: (defmacro with-each-natural-number (n expr) `(each-natural-number (lambda (,n) ,expr))) (with-each-natural-number n (format t ""~D~%"" n)) defmacro defines a function that takes a list as an argument, and returns another list. In this example, our macro is called every time the compiler seeswith-each-natural-number. It uses LISP’s “backquote” syntax to quickly construct a list from a template, filling inn and expr. The list is then passed back to the compiler. Of course, this macro would be useless in Ruby, because it’s working around a problem we don’t have. The second most common use of LISP macros is to create mini-languages for defining stuff: ;; Generate some bindings to our database ;; using a hypothetical ""LISP on Rails."" (defmodel <order> () (belongs-to <customer>) (has-many <item> :dependent?<query> what is lisp macro</query> Some jobs that required scripting languages in the 90s required learning something fast (everything is more complex nowadays – but at least you’ve got frameworks). Also, Perl, Python, etc, were very portable. Syntax-wise, however, I think the approach taken by Scheme and Eiffel are more sensible (there are reasons for the size of Common Lisp as well as Smalltalk – but I believe it is an impediment). Who knows, maybe people will try Lisp because of Ruby. I bet more people will get frustrated than contribute back. Also try Scheme. It’s a different philosophy and gets even less press than Common Lisp, but it’s worth it. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Boy I wish there was a comment editing facility here. More typos: “the bottom of this comment” – not “the bottom of this common” an extra “completely” in “no extra space or time is wasted” “even allowing you to make changes’ instead of “making changes as you go” Also, a clearer version of the iterate example would be: (iter (for x in '(-1 2 -10 4))<query> which is better scheme or eiffel</query> (finding x maximizing (abs x))) ;; => -10 Sorry, guys. I guess these don’t make too much difference, but hopefully this comment will clear up some confusion. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: null, that’s good advice but those not familiar with Scheme should remember that Common Lisp and Scheme are very different languages. The superficial similarities in their syntax don’t make that obvious, and so some people perceive them as pretty much interchangeable. I personally do not care for Scheme, and yet Common Lisp is by far my favorite language. So if you’ve had exposure to Scheme and didn’t like it, don’t dismiss Common Lisp out of hand (and vice-versa, too). I agree that it does take a lot of work and mind-warping to “get” Lisp and I also agree that that’s probably helped to hold it back.<query> what is the difference between scheme and common lisp</query> I think Peter Seibel’s book Practical Common Lisp (I cannot recommend this book strongly enough!) goes a long way to resolving that. nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: You remember what the Japanese car companies did to GM? :-) Big, powerful, shiny, etc, aren’t enough to match simplicity and hardwork. Lisp people ignore 90% of the Ruby features. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Sigh. Johnny, have you even read the discussion? Do you know what’s being discussed, or are you just making emotionally-driven, knee-jerk reactions because the superiority of your favorite language is being called into quexstion? Lisp people are aware of all of Ruby’s features because many of them come from Lisp. No one here is attacking Ruby (at least I’m not).<query> what language is ruby</query> The point of the discussion is simply that Lisp is awesome. Ruby’s geography has nothing to do with its properties as a language, and many of the concepts in Lisp are actually, believe it or not, much simpler than Ruby’s. It’s really not intelligent to make claims about the Lisp community, especially when you quite plainly don’t know Lisp. Also, what exactly is wrong with being a “dynamic language”? You use the term as if it were an insult. What is Ruby if not a dynamic language? nuke edit Beowulf said 1 day later: Bill, that was a very well written comment. One definite pain point for me has been the lack of macros. There is enough similarity in my comment and scoring system in different areas that I really have wanted a better method for abstraction.<query> what is ruby if not a dynamic language</query> Rails has the concept of Partials and Components, which can be used to abstract your design, however they also carry a pretty significant performance overhead. That overhead has forced me to abandon them on some pages because they simply were to slow with good abstractions in place. Several good macros on the other hand would have allowed me an elegant level of abstraction without that same type of performance hit. Practical Common Lisp (PCL) is definitely an important book for Lisp. It took me a long time to find a good book to learn Lisp from (this was prior to the release ofPCL), and I finally had to go back to Lisp by Winston and Horn. A book written in 80’s which is no longer in print. InPCL there is finally a well written introduction to Lisp that is relevant to solving the problems of the Internet age.<query> what is practical common lisp</query> I honestly hope Lisp gets an upsurge in popularity. Things seem to be moving more and more in the direction of power and expressiveness. It just appears to be happening at a relatively glacial pace. Lisp clearly has the power to stay the course though. As Eric mentioned in the original article though, Ruby really is a good next choice. Paul Graham once said if you can’t use Lisp, use Python. I’ve used Python for a long time now, and I definitely prefer Ruby to Python at this point. As a language it is much closer to Lisp than Python, and it’s OO syntax ismuch cleaner. That being said, it’s not a bad thing to know all three (Lisp, Ruby, and Python). nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Johnny, Bill, please keep it polite.<query> what language is better lisp or ruby</query> We’re having a good discussion here, and I don’t want totake away anyone’s vowels. :-) Bill’s point is excellent, and deserves elaboration. I can easily translate his code to Ruby: class Array def find_maximizing result, f_result = nil, nil each do |x| f_x = yield x if f_result.nil? || f_x > f_result result, f_result = x, f_x end end result end end [1,2,-3].find_maximizing {|x| x.abs } But my code is going to run much slower than Bill’s, because the iter macro lives in the compiler. The same goes for the IDv3 parser: It would look fine in Ruby, but get absolutely clobbered on performance. A year from now, this could actually be a pretty good sales pitch for Common Lisp. “It’s like Ruby, but it runs at full hardware speed!” nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Bill, you are one of the few who claim to be proficient at both, Ruby and Lisp.<query> what is the difference between ruby and common lisp</query> The problem is that the features that you or other people are going to use in Lisp are just a subset of the features that Ruby is used for. For example, Ruby is very suitable for shell programming, instead of Bash, Sed, Awk, Perl, etc. I just recently started using Rake, and it’s a really awesome tool to use for shell programming. RubyC, mkmf.rb, setup.rb, etc, really make it easy to create extensions for Ruby that bind to external libraries. I don’t think people enjoy creating bindings for Lisp as much as people do in Ruby. So, if all you want to do is to create WebApps in Lisp, fine. But that use is just a subset of what Ruby is normally used for. I know that Lisp is quite powerful as I said that myself. I know it’s used for tons of different things.<query> what is lisp used for</query> But WebApps really are what most people seem to be doing these days. Though with Ruby you can use it for more than just Web site handling. So, when I claim people don’t know most Ruby features, it’s just because they are spread among many use-cases, libraries, etc, just like in Lisp. Code RESTful in Ruby! nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Null wrote: I think the problem with Common Lisp and Smalltalk is the size of the stuff you have to learn, syntax-wise. I’ve taught Scheme to a lot of non-programmers over the years. The syntax is problematic, but only until they find a good editor. (Emacs, sadly, doesn’t work for many non-programmers.) The other big impediment is usuallyLET, which introduces too much nesting for some folks.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> The larger obstacle is learning to think in LISP (or SmallTalk, or Haskell, or any other powerful language). Bill can post a dozen excellent macros, and most people will say, “Huh?” Until you know how to use it, it’s just a weird feature. It’s actually easier to sell a language by solving small problems (my web apps are ugly!) than by proposing profound new features. Ruby gets in the door because (1) Rails is slick, and (2) the syntax doesn’t looktoo odd. And once people have played with ActiveRecord for a while, they begin to understand why metaprogramming is cool. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Johnny, even though few people write Makefiles or shell scripts in Lisp, it’scertainly possible. Lisp is basically a toolkit for building programs like Rake.<query> why is lisp used</query> t)) Using Ruby on Rails, we could write: class Order < ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :customer has_many :items, :dependent => true end Here, belongs_to is a class function. When called, it adds a bunch of member functions toOrder. The implementation is pretty ugly, but the interface is excellent. The real test of any macro-like functionality is how often it gets used to build mini-languages. And Ruby scores well here: In addition to Rails, there’sRake (for writing Makefiles), Needle (for connecting components), OptionParser (for parsing command-line options), DL (for talking to C APIs), and countless others. Ruby programmers writeeverything in Ruby. Of course, there’s lots of advanced LISP macros which can’t be easily ported to Ruby.<query> what is the function belongs_to in ruby</query> So why don’t you see more great Lisp frameworks? Mostly because (until very recently) the Lisp community was small, fragmented, and didn’t have anything likeCPAN or RubyGems. Most of the Good Tricks™ had been written down only once or twice, and the books had gone out of print. Fortunately, a lot of the missing pieces have appeared in the last five years, and many of the rest will be along soon. nuke edit timsuth said 1 day later: Eric: “def find_maximizing” Ruby 1.9 has “max_by”. [1, 2, -3].max_by { |x| x.abs } nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: OK, here’s another example of ITERATE that I hope showcases a little more of macros’ sweetness: (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 -4 -10 -43 49 49 8934)) (until (= (sqrt 7) x))<query> what is max_by in ruby</query> (collect x into collection) (finding x maximizing (abs x) into y) (finally (return (list collection y)))) ;; ((1 2 3 -4 -10 -43) -43) This is a lot more complicated than the other example, and still not really useful, but I hope it illustrates howITERATE provides a whole sublanguage for expressing any kind of iteration you can think of. I’d also like to point out that ITERATE can be extended with user-defined macros. For instance, I’ve written a macro calledAVERAGING that works withITERATE: (defmacro averaging (var) ""Add a clause to ITERATE to average the value of VAR."" (with-unique-names (count total) `(progn (summing ,var :into ,total) (counting ,var :into ,count) (finally (return (/ ,total ,count)))))) (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 4 5))<query> how to iterate macro</query> (averaging x)) ;; => 3 There’s more Lisping going on here, and some of this probably looks pretty esoteric (incidentally, this example also shows off Lisp’s docstrings – that string after the defmacro line will be associated with AVERAGING as its documentation, so I can run (describe ‘averaging) and get that string at runtime). But notice that I’m working with an extensible sublanguage for expressing the most common concepts in iteration. The examples Eric and timsuth gave could be defined in any language with first-class functions, but no language but Lisp could define a custom mini-construct like this. Note also that even thoughITERATE provides new coding constructs, I still have full access to Lisp within: (iter (for x initially 0 then (1+ x)) (if (evenp x) (print x)) (when (= x 10) (return x))) In this (contrived) example, everything except the first line is straight Lisp.<query> what is the lisp example</query> This sort of thing isn’t possible in Ruby. Here’s another example: (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line)) This will collect every line in file “foobaz” into a list. (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line at beginning)) will collect the lines in reverse by adding each to the beginning of the result instead of the end. (iter (for line in-file ""foobaz"" using #'read-line) (collect line at beginning result-type 'vector)) will collect the lines into a vector instead of a list. And so on and so on, ad infinitum (or nauseam, since my comments are starting to get repetitive).<query> what is the ruby example for a list</query> The point is that the authors ofITERATE have built a mini-language that is: 1) able to capture the most common iteration constructs, even relatively complex ones, like maximizing a function and collecting items based on some condition 2) user-extensible 3) written in Lisp and not part of the Common Lisp language itself – that is, you or I could sit down and writeITERATE and no one would know it wasn’t part of the language 4) fast, and yet still high-level There is much more to macros than just ITERATE, but I think ITEREATE is such a good example of the kind of power that regular syntax and macros can give you. And keep in mind that all this ends up as fast, tight machine code. And if it still isn’t fast enough, throw in some type declarations and optimization settings: (iter (for x in '(1 2 3 4 5)) (declare (type fixnum x)) (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (compilation-speed 0)))<query> what is iterate</query> (averaging x)) I hope that these comments are useful to people who are curious about Lisp. I wish I’d known about some of these things many years ago. All code untested. - Bill P.S. While I appreciate Eric’s request that we keep it civil here, Johnny, saying that Lisp only has asubset of Ruby’s features is outrageous. It is quite, quite the opposite. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: OK, since I’ve spent the majority of my day commenting here, it is time to go do some other things, but I would like to also call attention to the fact that those optimizations in the last example are local only to the block that contains them – I think that’s pretty damn cool. And just one more example of macros. AllegroCache is a commercial database for Lisp that lets you make queries in Prolog.<query> what is lisp macro</query> DISCLAIMER: I do not know Prolog very well, and I remember the examples I’ve seen very vaguely, so this may not be exactly and completely accurate, but it gives you a rough idea: (<-- (parent ?x ? y) (db person ?x children ? c) (member ? y ? c)) (<-- (grandparent ?x ? y) (parent ?x ? z) (parent ? z ? y)) Here, the <—macro indicates that the following forms will be in prolog. What we’ve done here is define parent and grandparent relations using Prolog. So we declare roughly how the two relate to each other, and then we can make queries on the database with these. So say I have a variable x with myself in it. I can then run the Prolog query macro, ?-, like so: (?-<query> what is the parent and grandparent relationship in prolog</query> (parent me ?x)) and AllegroCache will return the name of anyone in the database who has me as a member of their children list. I could do the same with grandparents. Folks, I think this is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. Again, these are macros, so all the prolog gets reduced to Lisp code at compile-time, but really have you ever seen anything this cool? Can you picture the hideousness of theSQL that would do this? Lisp owns. OK, for real, there are many more things in life than the RandomHacks weblog, and I must go and attend to them. Hope I’ve made a difference. nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: Alright, Bill. Sorry about my “car” analogy. Sorry for pretending that Lisp users use a subset of what’s normally available for Ruby.<query> what is the coolest thing lisp can do</query> It’s just that the world is too polite sometimes. If you use an “obscure” language and nobody talks about it, you are guilty of not spreading the world. If you use an “obscure” language and people talk about it, you are guilty of “hyping” it. It seems that we can only “hype” it if we present a revolutionary tool like Rails. Fine. Maybe in the future we will have some more of that. Till then, see you. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Nope, there will be one more comment. First of all, the Prolog clauses do not actually expand into any serious code – they expand into calls to AllegroProlog functions and a little bit of bookkeeping. My bad. I think I gave the impression that they directly become code that is equivalent to the Prolog.<query> what is prolog clause</query> nuke edit JAP said 1 day later: I could start this comment with LOL, because the proposed statement is showing so perfectly the real deep misunderstanding of many of us regarding Lisp: So let me shortly explain my point of view: The real reason that brought me to Lisp (and never will get me away from it) is simply this: You can build it out of 7 (s-e-v-e-n) primitive operators! And, as a consequence, no other language can be expressed in itself as short as Lisp. (As you probably know, quite any language can be expressed in itself.) So let me repeat: really no other language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) can be built out of less primitive operators.<query> what is the purpose of lisp</query> In particular, macros which actuallycompile mini-languages haven’t appeared yet, although they might be possible with enough work. (Ryan Davis has done some promising work in this direction with ParseTree and RubyInline, and I’ll be writing about related techniques as I discover them.) Ruby’s libraries, community, and momentum are good So if LISP is still more powerful than Ruby, why not use LISP? The typical objections to programming in LISP are: There aren’t enough libraries. We can’t hire LISP programmers. LISP has gone nowhere in the past 20 years. These aren’t overwhelming objections, but they’re certainly worth considering. Once upon a time, Common Lisp’s standard library was considered huge. But today, it seems painfully tiny. Java’s manuals fill a wall, and Perl’s CPAN archive has a module for anything you can imagine.<query> why use lisp</query> All the other features of Lisp are only natural consequences of the above. Because McCarthy did not “create” Lisp (as any other language designer does), he did “discover” it!! (If you read this sentence for the first time, please read it another 2 times). So the real point is: no other language can be more simple and more flexible than Lisp at the same time. BASTA! JAP (just another Paul [not Graham]) P.S. For the philosophers of us: we are all together very difficult, and really have a hard time to become more simple for the rest of our lifes ;-) nuke edit Johnny said 1 day later: One last comment: maybe “Lisp is the most algorithmic language”. nuke edit Haskell Junkie said 1 day later: Well, macros are fine and dandy, but don’t let the lisp diehards lead you astray.<query> what language is the most algorithmic</query> Learning the Haskell language will show you how to do all theDSL and other tricks using just higher order functions. After putting about 3 months effort into learning Haskell, you’ll probably come to see most macro usages as unnecessary hacks. I’d even bet that someone’s already done monads in Ruby. Interesting examples to get you motivated include parser combinators and backtracking. nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Bill, if you’re interested in combining Prolog with a Lisp dialect, I’ve heard thatThe Reasoned Schemer is an excellent introduction to logical programming in Scheme. Haskell Junkie, thank you for the links to the parser and backtracking papers. Haskell is often unrepresented in these discussions, which is too bad, because it’s a powerful and unique language. And yes, somebody is working on monads in Ruby. Once again, a big thank you to everyone for having kept this discussion friendly.<query> what language is haskell</query> Good manners make iteasier to have heated, passionate arguments about important stuff. :-) nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Eric, I’ve got PAIP here when I finally get around to learning Prolog in Lisp. I was mostly just impressed that it could be used to make complex queries on a database. Haskell Junkie, can you give some examples? nuke edit SB said 1 day later: “So let me repeat: really no other language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) can be built out of less primitive operators.” Except Forth. Or Factor. Or Joy. Let’s not be ignorant here :) nuke edit Ralph said 1 day later: As a humble current user of PHP and MySQL – but having been around sinceFORTRAN and Assembler and happy IBM 1620 Machine Language days – I want to say that I am enjoying the discussion here.<query> what language can be expressed in itself that short, and (as a natural consequence) In a way it sounds like a conversation among chess players, or artists. The “coolness” of a language, its elegance, its expressive power, are all important to language designers. I have constructed a few little languages, one of which even went into production in a small way. Recursive descent compiler, byte code interpreter, multi-threading at the application level. I understand the basics. But most of us, even those of us who do love elegance, nevertheless gravitate toward whatever language environment seems to get the job done with the least total effort. That means common operations must be expressed as easy-to-read idioms. If you consider the spoken form of natural language for a moment, I think you will find that it is essentially all made out of idiom. In writing, I can express something like, “The ship did not contain any containers containing containers, but it did contain several containers containing parts used to construct containers”—and here I use a bit of abstraction, made possible by a few minor regularities in the English language.<query> what is the idiom of language</query> No one who has been reading this thread is likely to have had any trouble immediately understanding what I just wrote. But in spoken language, it is quite difficult to express the above both clearly and concisely. Even people frequenting this forum might not be able to express or understand that thought quickly in spoken language unless something of the context had been pre-established. The reason for that, I think, is that there is probably no established idiom for even such a very slightly complex thought. If such thoughts had to be expressed with any frequency, an idiom of some kind would immediately and “spontaneously” arise. Then the above sentence would become trivial to express and to understand. Syntactic sugar provides idioms for commonly performed actions. Obviously, then, it must also reduce generality. Idiom is supposed to reduce generality.<query> what is the difference between idiom and idiom</query> “Admitting,” then, that one uses Perl, or even (gasp!) PHP, is like admitting that one uses ordinary spoken English. But we all do that. So, I’m eagerly awaiting Lisp on Rails, and all sorts of other great stuff, plus a hosting company that lets me write my web pages in that great stuff. Please. Use some of that “hard problem solving” ability to get it all accomplished, and I will be thrilled to be your very first customer. My current provider gets about $20 from me each month, depending on disk space and network bandwidth used. I am not trying to be facetious, much less rude. I am trying to raise a serious point, even though I did end on a rather familiar, even caustic note, for which I apologize if it jangled anyone’s nerves.<query> how much does perl cost per month</query> nuke edit Jules said 1 day later: This is a really good discussion! I’m a Ruby programmer, but I want to take a look at lisp. It looks good and I like its simplicity (based on only a few principles). I want to learn lisp because I enjoy programming. Am I right that there are 2 main lisps: Common Lisp and Scheme? Which one should I learn, what are the main differences? nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Jules, I would learn Common Lisp, but I’m biased :-). I linked to Practical Common Lisp earlier on. Take a look through the online chapters and see if you like it. That’s a pretty good way to get started. There’s also Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is a free book fromMIT and a classic in computer science.<query> what is the difference between lisp and scheme</query> You can pick up Scheme from it, but you’ll also get a deeper understanding of how Lisp-like languages work. There is a third Lisp in common use: Emacs Lisp. There are allegedly more lines of Emacs Lisp in use than Scheme and Common Lisp combined. Still, I don’t think I would recommend starting with Emacs Lisp, since it’s sort of quirky and sort of crippled. Anyway, happy lisping! nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Well, let me try to explain the differences between Common Lisp and Scheme, and other people can clarify—and fix my sweeping stereotypes. :-) Scheme is a very clean dialect of Lisp, with an emphasis on functional programming (see part one, above). One of the most popular implementations isPLT Scheme, which is often used with How to Design Programs.<query> what is scheme lisp</query> Common Lisp, on the other hand, tends to have better compilers and commercial support. Common Lisp’s culture embraces a diverse range of programming styles: functional, object-oriented, and imperative styles are all common, as are macros (see part two, above). Common Lisp also has more historical cruft than Scheme. Looking upthread, people seem to likePractical Common Lisp. You can download Common Lisp installers from the same site. Cultural and implementation differences aside, Common Lisp and Scheme are pretty much interchangable. You can always find a macro package which addsLisp features to Scheme, or vice versa. Either would be an excellent choice, and both are relevant to Ruby. nuke edit nemesis said 1 day later: Smalltalking with a Lisp: “Ruby was inspired mainly by Smalltalk and Lisp” Don’t forget Perl!<query> what is the difference between lisp and scheme</query> Ruby is very perlish… nuke edit Tayssir John Gabbour said 1 day later: Ralph, well, the tech.coop offers Lisp web hosting, and one of the guys there is working on something he humorously calls “Lisp on Lines.” (LoL.) Though I haven’t heard that it’s ready for common use yet. But keep in mind that I don’t “advocate” Lisp. At this moment, you will find barriers to entry. And while I think Common Lisp is a highly powerful tool, you need to take Lisp advocates’ words with a grain of salt. They’re good at explaining the advantages of Lisp, but many do not take care to discuss its current downsides. (Like the ones this blog entry discusses.) Therefore they may mislead. Now, most advocates mislead, but I like to hold CL people to a higher standard.<query> what is lisp on lines</query> Common Lisp, in comparison, doesn’t even have standard way to talk to the network. Similarly, LISP programmers are scarce. If you’re around Boston, there’s a small pool of grizzled hackers who can very nearly work magic. Elsewhere, there’s a thin scattering of curious young hackers. But LISP has always been a minority language. Ruby, on the other hand, is growing rapidly in popularity. The big driver seems to be Rails, and the ramp-up started in late 2004. If you’re trying to launch a company, it’s more-or-less acliché that every potential employee is a Rails nut. Rails will soon trickle back into ordinary web consulting, and from there–eventually–into big business. Ruby has also been around long enough to develop a good standard library, and alarge archive of add-on libraries.<query> what language is ruby</query> ;) nuke edit SB said 1 day later: nemesis: Ruby used to be Perlish, but nobody uses the blatant Perlisms ($_ etc.) anymore… nuke edit Jamie said 1 day later: “But my code is going to run much slower than Bill’s, because the iter macro lives in the compiler. The same goes for the IDv3 parser: It would look fine in Ruby, but get absolutely clobbered on performance. A year from now, this could actually be a pretty good sales pitch for Common Lisp. “It’s like Ruby, but it runs at full hardware speed!” That is not really an argument for or against either language. It is just saying that Ruby currently lacks a decent compiler. That was true of Lisp, once, and it won’t be true of Ruby, one day.<query> what language is perlish</query> One day Ruby will have a better compiler than Lisp if it stays popular enough to motivate a good commercial compiler to be written. Most of the arguments in favour of Lisp here seem to be around it’s macro facilities. Yet, any reasonably regular language can have similar facilities – especially if there is defined a normal form which all syntactic sugar reduces. And even better, if the sugar can be used in macro patterns as well as regular code. The point about Lisp being built out of 7 primitives isn’t really an accurate comparison. Ruby is also only built from a few primitives, if you process the syntactic sugar – which is just the same as using a Lisp reader macro – and in both cases there are a plethora of extra features which you can treat as being built from macro extensions and additional I/O primitives.<query> what is ruby vs lisp</query> I’m looking at all the Lisp examples in this discussion, and I’m seeing the Ruby examples also presented here, and (if you ignore execution time, as that is just compiler maturity), they look roughly equivalent in capabilities, just presented with different sugar – and more sugar with fewer parens in Ruby’s case. —Jamie (who doesn’t use Lisp much and has never used Ruby, but does know what compilers can do) nuke edit Eric said 1 day later: Bill, I’m just Haskell newbie, but I’ll take a stab at your question. You can find a lot of Haskell examples inA Gentle Introduction to Haskell, and I’ve had good luck with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. From a Lisp perspective, you’ll notice two things: (1) Haskell variables, once set, can never be changed, and (2) because Haskell uses lazy evaluation, you can easily represent infinite data structures.<query> what is the difference between ruby and lisp</query> Lazy evaluation allows you to do all sorts of cool things. You can represent iteration and data traversal in stunningly gorgeous ways. (In effect, everthing’s a co-routine.) You can also, if you’re so inclined, define an infinite list of all primes. Now, these features are very cool, but they come at a high price: Since you can’t assign to Haskell variables, you have to writeeverything in a purely functional style. Even I/O can be challenging, because it changes the outside world. So how do you write real programs in Haskell? As it turns out, Haskell has a second powerful trick: monads. Monads are pretty esoteric, but in Lisp terms, you might think of them as a way to metaprogramcontrol flow. The most common Haskell monad is IO , which makes Haskell statements execute sequentially, so you can talk to the outside world.<query> what is the most powerful haskell variable</query> Other monads implement assignment, list comprehensions, continuations, and domain-specific languages (like the parser combinators above). Haskell can be a challenging language—some common programming idioms can only be expressed with monads, which are at least as hard as macros—but, like Prolog, Haskell makes certain programs look gorgeous. And of course, there’s no reason why you couldn’t apply many Haskell ideas in Lisp, if that’s what you want. If you’ve mastered macros, and you’re looking for cool programming styles, Haskell’s not a bad place to start. nuke edit bill a said 1 day later: Jamie, these features of Lisp have nothing to do with the maturity of Lisp’s compiler. Instead, they have everything to do with Lisp’s regular syntax. It is indeed criminal that Ruby doesn’t even have a bytecode compiler, but this is not really the issue here.<query> what is haskell monad</query> The code in Ruby is much more than “syntactic sugar.” It is a complete formal language that has to be translated into anAST (abstract sy before being used. The following Ruby code: if foo.bar? and bar.baz? puts foo.to_s end does not simply expand into other code – it requires a full and complete Ruby parser to be transformed into anything useful. If you still don’t believe me, consider the fact that there can be aribitrary expressions in the if’s test, and that Ruby (like Lisp) treats if’s as expressions, and allows them to be used anywhere. I could write this: if foo.bar? and bar.baz? and (89 44 54.0444).abs \== 4 and (if x == 4; 56; nil) do_this end There is no “syntactic sugar” that will simply and straightforwardly translate that into anAST.<query> what is ruby code</query> Lisp’s syntactic sugar, which I guess you aren’t personally familiar with, is completely different. An example is the #’foo reader macro, which simply expands into (function ‘foo). Or the ‘foo macro, which expands into (quote foo). Lisp reader macros are merely shortcuts for other Lisp forms. They are syntactic sugar in the strictest sense, and do little more than very straightforward code transformations. As I hope my examples have made clear, this is pretty different from a language with syntax. I think the phrase “built out of 7 primitives” is misleading (although I think a poster higher up the thread was the first to use it). A better term would bedescribed in 7 primitives. There is code over at paulgraham.com that implements a full Lisp evaluator using only those seven operators.<query> what is lisp reader macro</query> The whole thing is about a printed page long. So the only point that can be made is that Lisp’s semantics can be completely explained with seven primitives. Which is still a cool thing, but not the same as what was being claimed. To build a language you still need a function to take strings and turn them into lists, and other handy things like I/O support and so on. (incidentally, here is Paul Graham’s code: http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.lisp). If you can point me to Ruby code equivalent to Paul Graham’s, I will concede the argument. But you won’t, and you can’t, because that isn’t how Ruby works. Ruby has a syntax, and Ruby needs a full parser to get from that syntax to anAST. Because Lisp code is naturally an AST, things are very different. Also, it’s true that if Ruby could be transformed into a more regular language you could write macros with it.<query> what is lisp language</query> This is, in fact, probably possible with Ryan Davis’s ParseTree package. But now your macros have to output (and work from) an intermediate format, instead of straight Ruby code. That intermediate format will be some kind ofAST and the mapping between real Ruby and that intermediate form will almost certainly be a hassle to manage, so why not ditch the syntax and use Lisp’s model, where all code is naturally and automatically anAST, and macros simply follow from that? nuke edit Haskell Junkie said 2 days later: bill, Here’s an example of a simple arithmetic parser and evaluator using theParsec library. And below is a little snippet of a non-deterministic program in action. Say you want find a pair of numbers which multiply out to 8633. Well, this isn’t the most efficient way to do it, but it looks nice and declarative… -- try combinations of factors between 2 and 100 and cull the wrong ones import Control.<query> what is the parsec library used for</query> Monad main = print ( do a <- [ 2..100] b <- [ 2..100] if a*b == 8633 then return (a,b) else mzero ) ...nothing new there, something that could also be done in lisp without macros (especially if your lisp comes with an “amb” operator). But it is nice to note that thelist monad which makes this work is implemented in 7 lines of code. nuke edit bdw said 2 days later: Well, I’ve considered the same thing, really. Ruby isn’t a ‘lisp’ because it is a denser functional language. Ruby isn’t really a functional language;LISP is. Ruby would have been a ‘new LISP’ (in the same way that ‘yellow is the new black’)if it would have been just a little more consistent.<query> what is monad in ruby</query>"
clueweb12-1503wb-33-01954,9,1,"What Is Desktop Linux Missing? Posted by Jon on June 12, 2006 The comments on my previous post about desktop Linux have gotten me thinking about what exactly desktop Linux needs in order to succeed. From where I sit, the big factors are: No Linux Distribution is built and marketed around the desktop . Sure, some distributions, such as SUSE Linux 10.1 OSS pretend to be, but in reality, they are still built around a set of philosophic principles that most end-users do not care about. If you want desktop converts, you are going to have to shut up about “restrictive software license” as an explanation why MP3s, Flash, PDFs, RealPlayer and Windows Media files do not work. The DVD Playback issue is not settled. Honestly, how do expect your average Joe to use your product when watching a movie on his laptop could make him a felon?<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I don’t know how this will shake out; either the ‘Betamax Defense’ will work, or some new tactic will have to be thought up, but I really believe that this one is a show-stopper. Drivers, Drivers, Drivers. If you are going to tout your product as a desktop replacement for Windows, then you are going to have to have as many driver options as Windows. No one wants to muck around with drivers just to get their network card working so that they can go read about what other hacks they need to get the rest of their hardware running. Excuses about not having access to specs from hardware vendors just don’t cut it here. If it doesn’t have drivers, and tons of them, and it can’t automatically detect and install more than 95% of the hardware out there, it isn’t a desktop operating system.<query> what is the difference between windows and betamax</query> Take a hint from Apple. No one is selling desktop Linux correctly. I don’t know what these folks have been smoking, but last time I looked, the large majority of people didn’t give a crap about freedom, cost-savings, or security update frequency when it came to theirOS. All people care about is whether or not their computer comes with everything they need to turn it on and start playing on the web and emailing their friends. Everything else is lagniappe. If you can’t sell it as an easier way to get stuff done, or you can’t get Dell to sell it preinstalled on their machines, you won’t sell it. There are probably other issues that I haven’t addressed, but from here, those are the biggies. Linux has a serious image problem – half of the desktopOS users don’t know what it is at all, and the other half think of it as too technical or “for experts and hackers”, regardless of whether or not they have ever used it.<query> why don't dell computers sell linux</query> Linux pundits have long talked about the technical merits of Linux, so much so that most people think of Linux as not being something they are capable of using, and as with most lifestyle and work-related options,better the devil you know than the devil you don’t. Posted under Pondering and tagged withDesktop Linux Comments (5) 5 Responses to What Is Desktop Linux Missing? June 15 2006 Shawn You have some good points, but I’m not sure I agree with all of them. The drivers, andDVD issues are no brainers. But the Take a Hint From Apple section got me thinking… Sure, it’d be nice to install anOS and never have to tweak it to work. But that just is not reality for most of theDIY computers – regardless of platform. I have to jump through hoops with Win2K/XP to get my Gigabit NIC working, I have to download comercial drivers for my Nvidia card.<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I have to update my sound drivers. All this will happen wether I’m running Windows or Linux (I have no experience with Macs, so can’t comment). The only way around the problem is if the hardware manufacture installs the OS for you – preinstalled operating systems, like you see on store bought laptops and desktops. Or like Apple, who controls both the hardware AND software. So, as long as you have those who want to do it themselves (the DIY boxes), you will ALWAYS have installation issues. Simply because of the odd hardware combinations, and/or cutting edge hardware where the manufacturer only creates drivers for one version of anOS. My Thoughts. June 23 2006 Jon Shawn, I agree that any DIY computing project is going to have hardware/software conflicts,but I don’t agree that, by extension, Linux on the desktop can be excused from having those problems.<query> why do i always have to update my sound driver</query> Linux on the desktop is not about DIY projects. It is about the 80-90% of computers that come from the store with anOS loaded that is never changed. Desktop Linux is about Joe and Jane Average using Linux on a day-to-day basis. The fact that I have an laptop with SUSE running KDE on it has nothing to do with Linux on the desktop, because no one can go to Circuit City and buy that product.

There have been 0 comments Print By Donna Gates, as seen on: Insufficient sleep plagues 50 million to 70 million Americans today, especially women. Yet, sleeping deeply is fundamental for staying young, healthy, and vibrant. As the years pass, sleep often becomes more elusive. If you are not falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up on time feeling refreshed, you’ll want to change this as soon as possible. Your brain is very much affected by the quality of your sleep. Research clearly confirms mood, cognition, and memory are negatively affected by sleep deprivation. So the solution is for an adult to sleep within an optimal range of seven to nine hours every night.<query> how many hours of sleep should i get</query> Napping works for many, and you may feel the need to take rejuvenating catnaps during the day. What’s most important is that your sleep be restful and restorative, with three to five complete sleep cycles that take you from drowsiness, into light sleep, followed by deep and then deeper sleep, and ending in REM. Most of us look for shortcuts when it comes to sleep. As with weekend-warrior exercise, we think we can “make up” weekday deficits by sleeping in on the weekend. But that’s not how it works. Many people also have caffeine, sugar, and alcohol in the late afternoon/early evening, further complicating their sleep issues. Another mistake we often make is using the computer or watching tv late at night. Light interferes with the production of melatonin, an important hormone related to sleep, so working late into the night, especially on the computer, or watching late-night tv might be cutting off years from your life.<query> what is the best way to sleep</query> If you’re having sleep trouble, it is crucial to reset your circadian rhythm or internal clock. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time Get up early and start to move. Exercise in the morning light will help you sleep better that night. In the spring, summer, and fall, sunbathe midday for 20 to 30 minutes. Since growth hormone is produced during the initial onset of nightly sleep. Go to bed early and you’ll not only become “healthy, wealthy, and wise,” you’ll also look and feel younger. Smaller pulses of growth hormone are also released later in your sleep cycle, so if you only sleep for five hours, you won’t obtain enough of this rejuvenating hormone. Make sure your last meal of the day contains a calming grain-like seed. Examples are quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and amaranth.<query> how to get your growth hormone back</query> They help create serotonin, which then turns into melatonin. As bedtime approaches, begin to celebrate the ritual of sleep. Take a hot bath and create a “sleep sanctuary,” with soft organic bedding, candles, soothing incense or aromatherapy, and relaxing music. Ensure that your sleep is restorative. A really great night’s rest is an investment in your anti-aging bank account!

Before starting any natural remedies, consult your doctor. Chronic insomnia can itself be a symptom of another condition, such as depression, heart disease, sleep apnea, lung disease, hot flashes, or diabetes, so it's important to see a doctor if you are having trouble sleeping.<query> what is the best sleep aid for insomnia</query> Natural Remedies for Insomnia Here are fourteen natural remedies that are used to treat insomnia. 1) Valerian Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) is a herb that has been long used as a remedy for insomnia. Today, it is an over-the-counter insomnia remedy in Germany, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Italy. Exactly how valerian works in the body is still not well understood. Some studies suggest that like conventional sleeping pills, valerian may affect levels of the calming neurotransmitter GABA. Unlike many other sleep medications, valerian is not believed to be addictive or cause grogginess in the morning. But valerian doesn't work for everyone. And although studies in labs have been encouraging, clinical trials are still inconclusive. Valerian is usually taken between an hour before bedtime. It takes about two to three weeks to work.<query> what natural remedies are used for insomnia</query> It shouldn't be used for more than three months at a time. Side effects of valerian may include mild indigestion, headache, palpitations, and dizziness. Although valerian tea and liquid extracts are available, most people don't like the smell of valerian and prefer taking the capsule form. Valerian shouldn't be taken with many medications, especially those that depress the central nervous system, such as sedatives and antihistamines. Valerian shouldn't be taken with alcohol, before or after surgery, or by people with liver disease. It should not be taken before driving or operating machinery. Consultation with a qualified health practitioner is recommended. For more information about valerian, read theValerian Fact Sheet. 2) Melatonin Melatonin is a popular remedy to help people fall asleep when the sleep/wake cycle has been disturbed, such as in shift workers or people who with jet lag.<query> what is valerian tea used for</query> Melatonin is a hormone found naturally in the body. The pineal gland in the brain makes serotonin which is then converted into melatonin at night when exposure to light decreases. Melatonin is typically taken about 30 minutes before the desired bedtime. Some experts caution that melatonin should not be used by people with depression, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases, and other serious illness. Pregnant and nursing women should not use melatonin. The University of Alberta study examined 17 studies with 651 people and found no significant side effects when used for three months or less. The long-term effect of melatonin supplementation is not known. For more information about melatonin, readBoosting Melatonin Naturally. 3) Kava Kava is an anti-anxiety herb that may be helpful for anxiety-related insomnia. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an advisory to consumers about the potential risk of severe liver injury resulting from the use of dietary supplements containing kava.<query> what is melatonin used for</query> To date, there have been more than 25 reports of serious adverse effects from kava use in other countries, including four patients who required liver transplants. Learn more:What is kava? 4) Relaxation Techniques Relaxation techniques are one of the most effective ways to increase sleep time, fall asleep faster, and feel more rested in the morning. They require a minimum of 20 minutes before going to bed. There are many different techniques: Visualization - involves imagining a relaxing scene. You can try it in bed before falling asleep. Involve all your senses. If you're imagining yourself on a tropical island, think of the way the warm breeze feels against your skin. Imagine the sweet scent of the flowers, look at the water and listen the waves--you get the picture. The more vivid the visualization and the more senses you involve, the more effective it will be.<query> how to improve sleep</query> Relaxation Response - A mind/body technique based on the principles of Transcendental Meditation. Learn how to elicit the relaxation response Mindfulness - A type of meditation that essentially involves focusing on your mind on the present. Learn mindfulness. Yoga - combines deep breathing, meditation, and stretching. A Harvard study found that daily yoga for eight weeks improved total sleep time, the time to fall asleep. If you've never tried yoga before, not to worry. There are many gentleyoga styles to choose from. Progressive Muscle Relaxation - is a promising natural remedy for sleep. If you've never tried a relaxation technique before, this technique iseasy to learn and simple to master. 5) Diet Cut out caffeine Caffeine can have a pronounced effect on sleep, causing insomnia and restlessness. In addition to coffee, tea, and soft drinks, look for hidden sources of caffeine such as chocolate, cough and cold medicine, and other over-the-counter medicine.<query> what is the best way to get sleep</query> Avoid sweets Although sugar can give a burst of energy, it's short-lived and can cause uneven blood sugar levels. This can disrupt sleep in the middle of the night as blood sugar levels fall. Eat foods that help you sleep Tryptophan is an amino acid that is a precursor to serotonin, which is then converted to melatonin. Carbohydrate snacks such whole grain crackers before bedtime may help to promote sleep. Just be sure to stay away from sweets. Eat magnesium-rich foods Magnesium is a natural sedative. Deficiency of magnesium can result in difficulty sleeping, constipation, muscle tremors or cramps, anxiety, irritability, and pain. It has also been use for people with restless leg syndrome. Foods rich in magnesium are legumes and seeds, dark leafy green vegetables, wheat bran, almonds, cashews, blackstrap molasses, brewer's yeast, and whole grains.<query> foods that help sleep</query> Continued on the next page...

Anything outside of that area is handled by the hotel desk's lost-and-found, except for items left on planes, which are handled by their respective airlines.<query> where is the tdc podium</query> Gone far afield, but there it is.

Why don't the airline companies trust you to check the IDs against the watch list? Are they afraid you'd reject too many of their customers?

Seriously, that hole opens up an easy detour around two of your layers of security: the watch list checking that you leave to the airlines (because it costs too much to buy scanners and computers) and the ID checking itself (you don't need a real ticket to enter the boarding area, just a pass that matches your ID). Christopher Soghoian demonstrated this glaring hole 2 years ago withthis stunt. And his proposed fix matches what you say you still lack: ""Give TSA employees scanners/computers, so that they can verify the validity of the boarding passes when you reach the security checkpoint.""

Bob, DHS is one of the worst abusers of ""classified"" information, often overclassifying information so it doesn't have to be shared. So pardon me if ""classified"" or SSI doesn't necessarily fly with me. As I work in the government industry, I know about sensitive and classified information. I also know that there's a lot of unclassified information out there too tagged FOUO (or its equivalent, SSI). As a representative of the government, sharing such information WOULD be an official use. I don't think anyone's arguing that TRULY sensitive information shouldn't be shared. However, I'm quite skeptical about SSI and classified information as used by TSA and DHS to justify ""just trust us"" mentality.

I see TSA continues to publish and endorse the following myth: The 9/11 hijackings made it clear that those safety precautions did not keep the pilots in control of the plane. What makes air travel particularly dangerous is that all law-abiding passengers and crew have been disarmed. It's clear that when passengers realize the deadly goals of hijackers, they have the courage to attack the hijackers, with their bare hands if necessary.<query> why was the 9/11 hijacking a myth</query> But we would all be safer if the honest passengers had weapons as good or better than the weapons smuggled aboard by hijackers. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even with today's security screening, many honest people accidentally bring weapons onto airplanes, and are not detected. If honest people can do it, so can hijackers -- and unlike the honest people, they'll use their weapon to seize the plane. The 9/11 hijackings were not successful because the hijackers were able to smuggle some kind of weapon on board. They succeeded because they knew the crews were forbidden to resist a hijacking. Before 9/11, a hijacker could successfully take control of an aircraft with nothing more than a ball point pen. TSA would have a lot more credibility if it stopped lying to the American public.

Yay for paying attention to details.

The TSA seems to be operating on security through obscurity with a little security theater thrown in to fool the masses. Security through obscurity doesn't work. Period. The list can be probe. If Mr. Terrorist's cousin can fly with no hassle because he's not on the no-fly or selectee list, then Mr. Terrorist knows of one name not on the list, and that's all Mr. Terrorist needs. Because of family ties, Mr. Terrorist probably looks enough like his cousin to use his ID. Mr. Terrorist is trained as well as a BDO and believes in what he's doing, so Mr. BDO doesn't notice anything suspicious, and neither does Mr. TSO. Mr. Terrorist is now on the plane. But wait! Mr. TSO did his job, and screened Mr. Terrorist well.<query> who is mr terrorist cousin</query> Yes. Some things were clarified, too. This list is considerably shorter than what I had been writing before, and is just about as exciting (read: not) once you get into it. Most of it's probably actually already known about anyway, but you wanted it, so here it is. And it's in no particular order, either, I just plopped it here when I found it. Ahem: 3-1-1 for carry-ons = 3 ounce bottle or less (by volume) ; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger placed in screening bin. One-quart bag per person limits the total liquid volume each traveler can bring. 3 oz. container size is a security measure. Most of that is true enough, except for the well-known fact that it'sactually 3.4oz (or 100ml) instead of 3oz.<query> what is the volume limit for carry on</query> Originally itwas just 3oz, and then that changed in, like, a week or so to bring it in line with our Eruopean friends, because 3oz was some weird number in mL for them. Scissors - metal with pointed tips and blades shorter than four inches It might be a trivial thing that most people can figure out on their own, but the measurement starts from the point of the fulcrum, not from the point where the blade actually begins. Since this isn't an issue on most scissors, though, most people aren't likely to care. :D Realistic Replicas of Firearms This is one that gives people all sorts of fits. Some would describe a realistic replica as being, y'know, black and metal and has an action that moves properly and such, like an AirSoft™ gun.<query> what is the measurement of a scissors</query> Others, though, take a far more stricter view of this - I've once seen a report of acapgun being stopped on grounds of being a realistic replica, and its owner charged by local law enforcement because of it. Oh, yeah, it wasbright orange plastic with a canary-yellow handle, and the 'revolver' part didn't revolve at all. How, exactly, that qualified as a 'realistic replica' I'll never know. Expect much in the way of uneven enforcement onthat one. Gel shoe inserts - Gel shoe inserts are not permitted, but shoes constructed with gel heels are allowed and must be removed and screened. This is another one that often gets maligned by the public, and rightfully so because of how it's worded. Specifically, they mean gel inserts for shoes.<query> are gel shoes allowed</query> Like, it's a plastic bag in the shape of a foot that slides into your shoe, and if you squeeze it or fold it, you can literally see the gelatinous interior flowing around the bends and your fingers and stuff. Common sense, incoming: The common Dr. Shoal's™ stuff at Wal-Mart doesn't count, given that it's soft, molded plastic, and not an actual ""gel."" If you are asked to undergo a personal screening you will be provided a screener of the same gender except in extraordinary circumstances. In some cases you may have to wait for a screener of your gender to conduct the screening. You will be advised if the wait will be more than a few minutes. And, in some cases, it doesn't happen. Period. At Huntsville, for example, we have a 'no cross-gender screening' rule.<query> can you have a personal screening at walmart</query> None whatsoever. Period, done, finito. Of course, that could also just qualify as a local policy and might not mesh with what you had asked in particular, but it's one of those... hm... delicate situations that most of the airpots have their own way of handling. I've... pretty much ripped apart the TSA website now, and most of the rest of it looks like it's fairly well in working order. There are a couple of other things that might have gotten past me, though. Other things, like why the TSA never put out a blurb about passengers now having unlimited passes through the WTMD after just years and years of only having two passes (and, even older, just a single pass), or why they never made a statement about the revising of the travel document stuff (which people still don't want to believe me on~).<query> can i have unlimited tsa passes</query> So, so many problems the TSA has in terms of public relations would be over in aflash if they just made a couple of updates to the stated policy to reflect what's actually accurate. I mean, I know it isn't TSA's strong suit, but I'm not talking about every single little regulation -- I'm specifically talking about making an attempt at it for the big mama chicken subjects like the TDC stuff. I know I made you wait a couple weeks for that one, CGBG, and I apologize for it; did I at least come close to what you wanted? It helps to be a little more specific, otherwise I get easily distracted and go off on tangents. :D July 21, 2008 6:33 PM Anonymous said...

In the midst of a discussion of the infamous 2004 soldier-with-jaw-wired-shut and wire cutters incident, HsvTso Dean said in passing: Why the supervisor didn't step in and allow them based on a legitimate medical purpose, I don't know. See, here's a dilemma that I don't know how to resolve. Do we want to allow exceptions to the SOP or not? If you grant TSOs (or supervisors) the ability to grant exceptions to the SOPs, you create problems with inconsistencies, which many (including me) have criticized loudly here. (""But they let me take this on the plane at [insert airport] ... why can't I take it on here?"") But if you don't allow for exceptions, you end up with embarrassing situations like this.<query> why can't a supervisor grant exceptions to a sop</query> I don't know TSA's SOP, much less the culture under which TSOs and supervisors operate. But I'm guessing that either (a) supervisors are not given the authority to override the SOP in any situation, or (b) supervisors have the authority, but are discouraged from using it, verbally or non-verbally. [Anyone who works for TSA want to confirm or deny? Dean?] That discouragement can be awfully subtle, of course. It's always ""safer"" to follow the rules; no-one up the chain will fault you for following the SOPs precisely, while you are subject to discipline if you waive the rules and someone up-the-line disagrees with your judgment call. (Notice that the TSOs involved in the nipple-piercing incident were backed 100% by TSA because they followed the rules ... even though it was obvious that the rules were inadequate in that very unusual situation.) And so, with supervisors unable, or unwilling, to override the procedures, you get to obvious ridiculous incidents ... like the wire-cutter-and-jaw incident, the nipple-piercing incident, or the pilot-and-catering-knife incident.<query> why do supervisors have authority to override the rules</query> So I don't know how to resolve that. I want consistency, so I know what to expect when I approach a checkpoint. But I also want TSOs to be able to exercise their best judgment in my favor when it's obviously in everyone's best interest, and doesn't compromise security. It is easy in any organization to lose track of the purpose of the organization. TSA's goal is to make airline travel safer, not to enforce rules & regulations. Now enforcing rules & regulations may be a perfectly legitimate mechanism to achieve the goal of safer travel ... but the rules are a means to an end, not the end themselves. I suspect that TSA struggles with this issue just like any business. So ... I'm rambling.

And then there are other situations where the Supervisors have that authority.<query> who has authority to override tsa sop</query> Kip Hawley wrote, in an internal memo, that the SOP is not Holy Writ, and that we will not be struck dead by lightning from the sky for not adhering to it rigidly. It wasn't written for all circumstances and scenarios, he said, and one's best judgment should take the day. This was about a month or so ago, in 2008. Back in 2004, it was a slightly different atmosphere, where there was an actual ""You may not deviate whatsoever from these guidelines"" clause in the SOP. Most Supervisors, however, aren't going to exempt a passenger from the SOP for anything less than extraordinary or compelling reasoning. To do otherwise would probably make upper management turn an eye at the Supervisor and start some kind of investigation or another. Just as a for-example, not wanting your digital camera x-rayed because it might erase the memory isnot one of the reasons to be exempted - our SOP states quite plainly that digital camerasmust be x-rayed, and it doesn't matter how much you want to argue about it.<query> why is a passenger exempt from the sop</query> Film cameras, however, are a different beast altogether. Me, myself, I would have considered the wirecutters that the soldier had to be a pretty extraordinary and compelling circumstance to grant him the exemption, even without having the need to summon over the Supervisor.

But my checked baggage is ALWAYS searched. Always. Carefully packed clothing and bags are disturbed, opened, not repacked in any semblance of the original order, so when I arrive, things are broken or crushed or otherwise unusable. I am hardly a fastidious person, but I am totally grossed out at the thought that the searchers are wearing gloves to protect themselves from contaminants -- as well they should -- but don't change the gloves from one search to the other.<query> how old do you have to be to get off a watch list</query> That means that if there is some biological or chemical threat, they are protected, but it's being spread into other bags headed for other destinations.

Which has happened. The first thing I do now when I reach my destination is find a washing machine and dump everything into it. I rarely fly any more unless I absolutely have to. An 18 hour drive is preferable to the hassle of having my bags searched and the general rudeness of the TSA staff.

While a September 2007 report may have said that there are 700,000 records on the terrorist watch list and it was growing by an average of 20,000 per month, that is not the same as the number of individuals on the watch lists.

The list is ways too big. 400,000 individuals on the consolidated terrorist watch list is way too much, and makes it impossible not to have name confusions. Remember, the list sources are so crazy they included even Nobel prize winner 90-year-old Nelson Mandela. 2. The watch lists are checked by airlines, who then give people their boarding pass (marked SSSS if you match the list) and let the person roam freely around until they voluntarily go through security, which does not check the list. 3.

If they are outside the United States, then of what use is this list in restricting access todomestic flights?

If they are so dangerous that we must restrict their movement, should we not arrest them and then let a judge or jury determine whether they should be imprisoned or placed under house arrest?<query> why is the dhs blacklist used</query> It is not the duty of the TSA or any other part of the Executive Branch to judge guilt and impose punishment. Those are reserved for the Judicial Branch. However, that is precisely what the TSA is doing.

It was some 8 months and several flights later that I finally heard about DHS TRIP -- and not from any one of the airline agents that I asked for help, but from Bruce Schneier's blog. I filled out the DHS TRIP form, and later received a letter saying, essentially, ""If anything needed to be changed, it was changed,"" and giving instructions on how to appeal this (lack of) decision. For all I knew, they decided I was a problem, and I wouldn't be allowed to fly next time -- with no advance notice, of course. I went back and forth on what to do, and finally decided I should try to appeal.<query> how to appeal dhs trip</query> I called up to ask about it, and the agent asked me to read the first paragraph of the letter I was sent. It turned out this was the letter they send to people who were cleared. I haven't had problems since, but I have no idea if that is a coincidence or not, since I now make sure that I always sign up for frequent flier programs so they have my full name and birthdate (which seemed to help before I signed up for DHS TRIP, though that could be a coincidence too, of course). This whole time was rather stressful. I travel a lot for work, and if I was suddenly unable to fly, I was probably going to have to relocate or quit my job. Of course, now I'm pretty sure that was never a real possiblity, but I didn't know that at the time.<query> can i travel without a passport</query> No one would tell me anything -- even though apparently I wasn't the person they were looking for. I understand there is some need for secrecy, but I don't understand the need to keep people in the dark about their status and how to correct it. July 14, 2008 9:50 PM CBGB said...

This would be similar to putting out a BOLO for a black male with no other descriptors. Would that give a police officer the right to harass every black male in their path? Of course not, but that is what the TSA is doing with the list. Don't you think you would get a better reception is you get out of spin mode and go into truth mode for a change? Try explaining that airline tickets are purchased without any descriptors except for a name. The last time I bought tickets they did not ask my weight, age, height or even sex. Try telling the people that if their name is Teddy Kennedy they will get a ssss because some Teddy Kennedy somewhere has done something to make you suspicious.<query> what is the name of the person on the no fly list</query> Once TSA's Secure Flight initiative is in place the number of misidentifications will be GREATLY reduced. Under Secure Flight, TSA assumes watch list matching from dozens of airlines and implements a uniform, efficient matching process.

There are two issues I have here: 1) There is still no means to stop a terrorist with a fake ID (or even a 'real' ID obtained using fraudulent documentation) from bypassing your ""no fly"" list. 2) Many of the terrorists you're looking for aren't likely to appear on any ""list"" maintained by anyone, providing this false sense of security. New terrorists are trained all the time, and suicide bombers, for example, aren't terrorists yet until they plot an attack.

We also should know that every commercial flight has more than one pilot in the cockpit. With those two things in mind can the TSA please explain how doing anID only check for pilots makes the aircraft safer than using the standard weapons screen?

If anyone is that dangerous and you know it, they should not be walking around free."" I generally agree, though I'll add that it's not the Executive Branch's place to say who should walk around free and who should not -- that's for the Judicial Branch. Following are some very relevant questions and answers fromGilmore v. Ashcroft -- FAA ID challenge FAQ: Q. Isn't an ID check needed to stop known terrorists from flying? If we knew who the terrorists were, we could just arrest them all, rather than stopping them when they try to fly. So what do you mean by ""a known terrorist""? A previously convicted hijacker?<query> why is a faa id check necessary</query> A card-carrying member of Al-Queda? A Green Party member, who seeks to change our established form of government? Someone on probation, convicted of non-violent civil disobedience for protesting the Star Wars program at Vandenberg Air Force Base? A member of Earth First!? There is good reason to believe that any list of ""known terrorists"" contains ""suspected"" terrorists, not actual terrorists, and is full of errors besides. Particularly when the list is secret and neither the press nor the public can examine it for errors or political biases. ""Johnnie Thomas"" was on the watch list because a 28-year-old ""FBI Most Wanted"" man, Christian Michael Longo, used that name as an alias. But Longo was arrested two days after joining the ""Most Wanted"" list for murdering his family.<query> who is on the most wanted list</query> After he had been in custody for months, 70-year-old black grandma ""Johnnie Thomas"" gets stopped every time she tries to fly. Her story is in the May 2002 issue of New Yorker magazine. It's not clear why an ordinary criminal like Longo was on the list in the first place -- nor why he wasn't removed from the list when he was captured two days later. What is clear is that this secret watch-list is poorly controlled and ripe for abuse. And, of course, there is no guarantee that an actual terrorist would be carrying their real ID. There are many ways to deter terrorism, but checking IDs against a watch list is not one of them. It is an exercise in futility that provides a false sense of security. Q. So then how should we figure out who is a terrorist?<query> who is on the watch list of terrorists</query> Copied and Pasted from EFF.org, originally posted October, 2007: EFF Comments on Terror Watch List Since 2003, the government has been building, testing and using the Terrorist Screening Database, stitching together several disparate terrorist lists from various agencies into one vast, centralized database that is a single consolidated watch list of suspicious individuals. Information in the TSDB can be used to decide whether individuals will be allowed to enter the country, get on an airplane, become citizens, or if they will be detained at routine traffic stops. It?s a central factor in other programs, like Secure Flight, the Transportation Security Administration?s proposed plan to ?screen? millions of travelers. This week, EFF filed comments on some proposed changes to the Terrorist Screening Records System, which includes the watch list as well as other records. EFF urged the FBI to reconsider its 2005 decision to exempt the TSRS from crucial Privacy Act requirements, which makes it impossible for citizens to use the courts to access or challenge false or inaccurate data that may have found its way into the system.<query> what is the tsdb used for</query> It's a good question, that goes to the heart of the post-9/11 civil liberties issues. Who is a terrorist? Any IRA member from the last twenty years? A member of the Irgun (led by former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin)? Nelson Mandela, imprisoned for sabotage for 27 years by the South African government? A WTO protester? The US Government killed more Afghani civilians in the last year than the number of US people killed on 9/11; does that make US soldiers terrorists? Israel and Palestine both claim that the other is terrorist. So do India and Pakistan. So do leftists and rightists in Colombia. Ultimately the line between ""terrorist"" and ""freedom fighter"" is a political one. Our freedom to travel should not depend on a politician's decision about whether they agree with our aims or not.<query> who is a terrorist</query> Every ""anti-terrorist"" measure restricts people based on their politics, not just based on whether they use violence. Violence was already illegal. In other words, any list of ""terrorists"" will inevitably contain many individuals that have never committed a terrorist act, and not contain many individuals that have actually committed a terrorist act. Q. Won't elimating ID checks make air travel more dangerous? No. First, air travel is far less dangerous than driving a car or riding a bicycle. This includes the danger from terrorist incidents as well as the much more common mechanical problems and human errors. A car is dangerous because it's a heavy mass of metal moving at high speeds compared to what is nearby. The energy in that motion can easily crush humans (either inside or outside the car), or other objects like trees, buildings, or cars.<query> why is it dangerous to travel by plane</query> Safely using a car requires the application of good human judgment every second. Whenever that judgment is missing (unconscious driver) or poor (intoxicated, enraged, or suicidal), then a car is a danger to those in and around it. An airplane is dangerous because it's a ""car"" with much more mass, much higher speeds, the ability to move in three dimensions instead of two, and carrying a much greater load of high-energy material (gasoline). Commercial air travel has been safer than car travel only because of rigorous professionalism, having co-pilots always ready to take over, and safety precautions far exceeding those of amateur-operated cars. The 9/11 hijackings made it clear that those safety precautions did not keep the pilots in control of the plane. What makes air travel particularly dangerous is that all law-abiding passengers and crew have been disarmed.<query> why is air travel safer than car travel</query> It's clear that when passengers realize the deadly goals of hijackers, they have the courage to attack the hijackers, with their bare hands if necessary. But we would all be safer if the honest passengers had weapons as good or better than the weapons smuggled aboard by hijackers. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that even with today's security screening, many honest people accidentally bring weapons onto airplanes, and are not detected. If honest people can do it, so can hijackers -- and unlike the honest people, they'll use their weapon to seize the plane. My philosophy is to ""educate and then trust the general public"". This philosophy is in line with the basic values of democracies. The government's approach to homeland security is ""keep everything secret and trust nobody"". This is in line with the basic values of authoritarian governments.<query> why do honest people bring weapons onto airplanes</query> I completely agree. July 17, 2008 8:27 PM Bob Eucher said...

False and inaccurate data is a well-documented problem for the TSRS. For instance, in 2005, the Department of Justice?s own inspector general found that the watch list had major data accuracy flaws. And last month, the DOJ?s IG again issued a damning assessment of the system, finding that it had a substantial error rate, suffered from incomplete and inaccurate information, and noting that the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which runs the list, was slow to respond to citizen complaints. In a sample of 105 records, 38 percent were found to have inconsistencies and inaccurate information.

But whether or not the TSA will keep using it is answered by the CYA posture in: ""The simple truth is that it would be negligent to not use this information to our advantage."" -- whether or not it is effective, or truly a damaging waste of time, TSA must continue to use the watch lists because they would be perceived as negligent if they did not.

To determine if that six-week sweet spot would hold true for international routes, I asked the company to analyze fares for several trips, like a summer vacation to Europe and a winter escape in the Caribbean. Not only did the six-week period fail to stand up, but the findings indicate that the window for booking the cheapest ticket for these trips has increased over the past three years; in some cases it’s up to 24 weeks. “Consumers have been getting the best prices a bit further out year over year,” said Chuck Thackston, managing director of data and analytics at the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> how far in advance do you buy a flight</query> (1) the top social networks (1) thedrum (1) top mobile phone manufacturer (1) top social networks (1) Tracking (3) traffic data (1) TV (2) tv and apps (1) tw (1) twelpforce (1) Twitter (32) Twitter and TV (1) twitter business (1) twitter for business (1) Twitter Guides (9) twitter latest (1) twitter management (1) twitter marketing (1) Twitter Security Issues (2) twitter stats (1) user (1) user interface (1) Videos (1) viral (1) Virgin (1) web design (1) webdesign (1) website design (2) website guide (1) website landing pages (1) websites (1) Widgets (1) XBOX (2) Xbox Live (1) zynga (1) Text Widget Pages Home Contact Us Labels #RiotCleanUp (1) 2011 Social Business (9) 2011 social media (2) 2012 community management (1) 2012 olympics (1) 2012 reports (1) 2012 social media (2) 2012 tools (1) 4s (1) 900 million (1) Ad Networks (1) adobe (3) Adobe Flash (1) Advertising (5) Adverts (3) Agencies (3) airtime (1) Analytics (6) android (1) Apple (5) apple.<query> what is twitter</query> Sure, it’s possible that if travelers pull back on spending, airlines will be forced to cut prices, allowing travelers to nab a cheap summer flight to, say, Barcelona, as little as three weeks out. “If they don’t see bookings materialize the way they’d like, they will put the route on sale,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst. But Mr. Harteveldt and other travel watchers agree that booking well in advance is a safe bet. So far this year, airlines have raised rates three times, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of Farecompare.com, which tracks ticket prices. “I think pricing is going to be crazy,” particularly this summer, he said. So if you place stock in historical trends, the message is clear: act now. For guidance, here are the booking windows during which passengers paid the lowest price for flights to popular vacation destinations last year, based on data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> when do airlines raise prices</query> Europe in Summer LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 21 TO 22 WEEKS IN ADVANCE You may already be too late to score a cheap flight to Europe this summer. The booking window for the cheapest tickets has moved further out, from 11 or 12 weeks in advance in 2009 to 21 or 22 weeks in 2011. (Average round-trip fares rose to about $1,500 last year from $1,100 in 2009; this year’s outlook is no better.) To boost your savings, take the least expensive route to Europe you can find. Then concentrate on getting to your ultimate stop cheaply. “I look into the cheapest fare into a hub like Berlin,” said George Hobica, founder ofAirfarewatchdog.com, which scours the Web for bargains. “Then I figure it out from there.” He said this may involve taking the train or flying a budget carrier like easyJet or Ryanair to the final destination.<query> how far in advance to book a flight to europe</query> Spanish airports like Madrid tend to be cheaper than London or Paris, he said. Dublin and Shannon also tend to be cheaper jumping-off points. Whatever you do, don’t wait until the last minute. Last year, average fares for tickets purchased less than a week before travel were about $2,600, almost double the price of those bought at least 28 days in advance. And if you’re visiting London during the Olympic Games, July 27 through Aug. 12, expect to pay a premium. Caribbean in Winter LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 11 OR 12 WEEKS In 2009 and 2010, the cheapest airfares went to procrastinators who purchased tickets just two weeks in advance at a saving of about 8 percent. But last year, the pattern took a sudden shift, with the cheapest tickets bought much further ahead. “Certainly you’ll want to start shopping plenty early to get a gauge on pricing,” said Mr. Seaney of FareCompare, who recommended hunting for airfare as early as three months in advance, especially for hot spots like Costa Rica and out-of-the-way islands, which lack the airline competition that tends to keep prices in check.<query> how far in advance should you book flights</query> Business or First Class to Asia or Europe LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 23 TO 24 WEEKS While the majority of premium travel is purchased by business travelers booking within six weeks of departure, leisure travelers with the flexibility to buy well in advance have been able to find bargains. Travelers paid about $3,113, or about 20 percent less than average, when buying premium tickets to Asia or Europe 23 or 24 weeks ahead last year. A good time to take advantage of low business-class rates is during peak vacation times like summer or the winter holidays. While coach class quickly fills up with leisure travelers, the cushy seats at the front of the plane can be empty. Rather than give those seats away as upgrades, airlines often try to fill them with sales, according to Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the travel Web site JoeSentMe.com, which alerts members to such sales.<query> when is the best time to buy airline tickets</query> For travel to Europe in summer, for example, “it looks like all gateways and all destinations between the United States and Europe are on sale,” he stated in a recent newsletter, with round-trip business class prices as low as $2,327 from Newark to Brusselsand $2,359 from New York to Frankfurt, if booked by May 31. But, he warned, “Fares seem to be higher in August than in July, and there are some days when prices soar above $4,000 round trip from the East Coast.” General Tips Beyond historical trends, there are also some useful online tools that can help you evaluate fares. For example, Bing.com offers a Price Predictor that uses algorithms to determine how likely a fare is to rise or fall during the next seven days. It applies to flights from more than 250 cities in the United States and to top domestic destinations and major hubs in Europe.<query> what is the average cost of a flight from the us to europe</query> If you decide to wait in the hopes of a price drop, sign up for fare alerts offered by practically every travel site, from American Airlines to Travelzoo. Yapta.com, another price-tracking service, alerts travelers when the price of their plane tickets drop after purchase, allowing travelers to request an airline voucher for the price difference. For the cheapest dates to fly, go to Itasoftware.com , which allows you to scan an entire month’s worth of fares. To buy, you must go to the airline’s Web site or online agencies like Travelocity. Finally, buying two one-way fares on separate airlines can be cheaper than the best round-trip price. Kayak.com calls such tickets “hacker fares.” A recent search on the site for a flight from Boston to San Juan, P.R., turned up a fare of $313 on Delta to San Juan, returning on US Airways, compared with $349 round trip on US Airways alone.<query> how to find the cheapest airline tickets</query> http://SocialBusinessToday.net - The Best in Social Business Email This BlogThis!

Favorite Cats Favorite Names For Cats CFA Breed Profiles Slide Show GCCF FIFe TICA Finding And Buying A Kitten Cat Moody of Stormwatch Maine Coon cats has once again kindly permitted me to reprint her fine article ""How to Find a Maine Coon Kitten"". The article is reprinted below and I hope that you will take the time to read it and perhaps read it twice.<query> what breed of cats are available for purchase</query> Sometimes, after all the investment is made, a cat is found to be infertile. Good breeders make a huge investment into ""doing it right"", by having the right breeding cats and facilities. Both pet shops and BYB's reap profits, by cutting corners (not having quality cats as parents, not showing, not keeping kittens until the proper age or providing proper prenatal and kitten veterinary care) - and then they charge the same price as the reputable breeders. And those caring, professional breeders make huge sacrifices in their personal lives, and shed lots of tears, in trying to create succesful breeding programs. BYB's are ""one hit wonders"" - they take your money and are gone. Most legitimate breeders are going to be pretty darn annoyed if you neglect to send photos and check in once in awhile!<query> what is byb</query> Visiting a Cattery You are well advised to shop around. All kittens are cute (repeat this in your head over and over as you cuddle kittens). All of them! It's hard to stay objective, but you are selecting a companion that should hopefully be with you for the next fifteen years or so - an expensive companion at that. It's really hard not to fall in love - and especially if a kitten falls in love with YOU! that's usually a good indication, kittens are very smart. But you should make the BEST choice, not the fastest choice. Plan to meet the breeders at their home. Visit the cattery, meet the adults, including the parents (if the breeder used an outside stud, the dad might not be there). Is it clean? Sure, if the breeder has ten cats, you may detect a bit of litterbox odor - but do the boxes look like they have been properly maintained (recently scooped)?<query> how to know if a cat is a good companion</query> Do the food and water dishes look clean? Cats can trash a place in mere moments, so don't be expecting perfection - but DO expect to see that care has been taken in maintaining the facilities. If the breeder has stud males, they HAVE to be confined in most cases - even if they don't spray, they will surely manage to breed their sisters or moms if not confined. And you may smell male cat odor - well, the males do that, and they are proud of it. But the smell should not make you gasp for breath. Despite being confined, you should be able to see that the studs have adequate space to stretch, sleep, and play. By and large, stud males are aggressively friendly cats, who should be anxious to make your acquaintance. They are usually retired show cats, who necessarily are by nature friendly, trusting, and affectionate animals.<query> do male cats smell</query> Sometimes they may indicate their friendliness by taking a nip out of your arm, but rest assured this is an overexcited response - a love bite. Females - well, give them a break - almost every one of them will have good days and bad. They seem to get PMS once in awhile. But if you see three females who are throwing themselves at your feet, and one glaring at you from the top of a cabinet, assume that the ONE girl is having a bad day. It's really important that the breeder's adult cats be friendly and curious. Give them a few moments to get used to you, but you should EXPECT that most, if not all, of the adults should be anxious to meet you. These cats are the example of what the breeder is doing. If most of the cats slink by, nervous and scared, or the breeder has to drag the parents out from under the couch, beware.<query> how to breed a female cat</query> Retired show cats are generally very anxious for attention - after all, they were trained to revel in the adulation of large crowds of people. Mom cats, by the way, are not usually too protective of their kittens - usually, they are trying to push themselves in front of their kittens to get your attention, not to protect their kittens. Check out the parents. There are many styles of MC's to choose from, from a ""sweet"" look to very ""feral"". You should choose the style, sex, and color you are most attracted to - although, if it really doesn't matter for any other reason, you should definitely go for the kitten who ""picks"" you. They sense something special, a bond, and are never wrong! Breeders may have waiting lists, which is not a bad thing, for particular colors or sexes.<query> what type of cat is a mom cat</query> But don't despair. If you are a bit flexible, you will get your kitten sooner. And waiting lists have a habit of being flexible - someone will wait nine months for a silver male, walk in to choose their kitten, and get ""chosen"" by a brown female. Waiting lists only mean that a breeder has been evaluated before, and found desirable by others. See how the kittens are raised. No, cages are not necessarily a bad thing if they are used by breeders in specific situations, such as keeping two litters apart from each other until they both have been vaccinated. Sometimes two females who have kittens can't be together due to territorial issues. But if kittens are being raised in a remote part of the house, mostly by the mom-cat, they might not be well-socialized.<query> when do you get your kittens</query> There should not be a dozen litters of kittens around - two or three litters at once is a LOT for breeders to cope with. It takes a lot of time to raise every kitten. And see their personalities. If you are viewing very young kittens, under 6 weeks of age, they might be a bit timid. By ten weeks, you should have a hard time escaping from the room with your shoelaces tied. The earlier you view the kittens, the more you should rely on your impression of the adult cats. Most legitimate breeders can accurately identify different personality types in their kittens by the age of l0-l3 weeks. If you have an unusual home situation - an aggressive dog, a dominant female cat, a child who is too excitable - please please please listen to the breeder's recommendation.<query> how old do kittens have to be to breed</query> We can usually be helpful in choosing the kitten with the right temperament for each situation. If the breeder says ""oh, they're all the same"" - they are more interested in money than matchmaking. They may all be appropriate to any situation, but they are ALL different. So the most important part of your shopping should be identifying a breeder you want to work with. The vast majority of kittens placed bounce right into their new homes, healthy and happy and adjustable. But if you have a problem with your kitten, you need to have established a mutually trusting relationship with the breeder. So make sure you feel comfortable with the breeder - hard to believe, but it's more important in some ways than which kitten you pick out. The most important question to be answered on a visit to a cattery is, ""Do the breeding cats and resulting kittens seem like beloved family members?"" They should all be treated as pets, even if a quasi-professional cattery facility exists.<query> what is the most important thing to do when buying a kitten</query> The adults should be friendly, clean and healthy, and delighted to meet you. The kittens should be curious, healthy and affectionate. Most breeders have some kind of health problems from time to time - so you might see a sneezy kitten once in awhile. A good breeder will tell you what the problem is, what they are doing about it, and what they expect the prognosis will be. A bad breeder will ignore or deny that a problem exists. Most important? Shop around - do your homework on researching the breed - and trust your instinct. Never, ever buy a kitten if you have any hesitation - there's lots to choose from. And if you shop wisely, you will end up with a terrific kitten who will be the very best choice in the whole world, and enhance your life for years to come.<query> what is the best breed of kitten</query> But be smart about it! Questions to Ask a Breeder You are making a big investment, in both money and time, and should make sure that you are getting the very best kitten you can. Ask the following questions of any breeder you contact. A vague answer or two might be expected, but most of these questions should be answered to your satisfaction - or go elsewhere. And most of all, does the breeder seem friendly and anxious to answer your questions? If they seem annoyed with you, move on. Most of us are proud of what we do, and happy to hear from informed pet buyers who have done their research and are asking a lot of questions - it makes us feel more confident in the commitment the pet buyer intends to make to this kitten. Always ask, right up front, if this is a good time to talk.<query> what questions should i ask a kitten breeder</query> The information applies to anyone who is interested in adopting a kitten of any breed. How to Find a Maine Coon Kitten By Cat Moody, Stormwatch Maine Coons Catmoody@aol.com (reprinted with permission) First, put ""pet shop"" right out of your mind. No reputable breeder, of any kind of cat or dog, would even consider selling an animal to a pet shop. Kittens found in pet shops are from what would be considered ""puppy mills"" in the dog world. Pet shop prices will always equal or exceed what a reputable breeder would charge. And you cannot evaluate the conditions the kitten was raised in, or meet its parents, or other adults of the breed. It is a massive mistake to think about ""rescuing"" a puported MC from a pet shop. Almost as bad are the backyard breeders (abbreviated BYB).<query> where can i find a kitten in maine</query> And remember, many of us show on most weekends, so don't feel ignored if it takes a week or so to get a return phone call. Always give a breeder two tries (leave messages) - don't give up if you don't hear from them five minutes after your last call. Most breeders are courteous enough to return the call, even if they have no kittens available right now - and most also are gracious enough to refer you to someone else in the area if they have no kittens but know someone who does. Those are usually good recommendations to follow. l. Do you show your cats? Do you have a registered cattery? All legitimate breeders will answer ""yes"" to both questions. Now, of course, there are exceptions to the first part - maybe the breeder has recently moved, had a baby, or has some other legitimate reason for taking a break.<query> do you show kittens</query> It is NOT an acceptable answer if the breeder proclaims there is no reason for showing. Showing your cats is not about (necessarily) obtaining titles or acclaim for a cat, and experienced exhibitors are not an elitist, unfriendly bunch. We show our cats to improve our breeding programs, to subject our cats to the evaluation of judges and other exhibitors, and to maintain contacts with the established breeding community, who share a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of the MC, including health problems. Showing is how we find appropriate outcrosses, compare our results to others, share concerns, and develop a group of ""shoulders to cry on"" when we are having a problem. We also have a darn good time! There is no excuse for not having a registered cattery. If you don't know what this means, look at a purebred cat's name - it has three parts.<query> why show a cat</query> ""Stormwatch's Havok of Purrfection"" is a typical example. ""Stormwatch"", the first part, is the name of the registered breeder. The second part of the name, ""Havok"", is the cat's name. The third part indicates the registered owner of the cat. If a cat is kept by the original breeder, you won't see any ""of"" designation. The breeder's name is the most important part. The name of the breeder follows the cat throughout its show career, and is on the pedigrees forever. We take pride in our cats, and our cattery name is the identifier for many generations to come. A BYB or pet shop could care less. One other advantage to buying a kitten from a breeder who shows - since we can't determine who is going to be ""pet"" and who is going to be ""show"" until much later, kittens ALL have to be raised as potential show cats.<query> what is the difference between a cattery name and a breeder name</query> This means they need to get used to bathing, grooming, claw clipping, riding in the car, and greeting strangers at an early age. In addition, top show cats generally have a superior disposition - they are trusting, laid-back, and fond of people in general. They pass these qualities on to their kids in most cases. Show cats are necessarily bred for temperament. 2. Can I see the pedigree? You really don't know much about who those cats are in the pedigree, but you sure as heck can identify a mother/son or brother/sister breeding. This can happen in the finest cattery, and doesn't usually cause a problem - but we call these breedings ""oops"", and will tell you that this was an accident. BYB's typically do a lot of ""linebreeding"" or inbreeding, since legitimate breeders won't sell them cats.<query> what is the temperament of a show cat</query> So they tend to keep their own offspring, and then breed back to its relatives out of necessity. Ask the breeder how they feel about linebreeding - most of us try very hard to use outcrosses as much as possible, believing this is the healthiest combination for the cats. Reputable breeders will be happy to show you the pedigree, and are usually proud to point out the many titled cats - champions, grand champions, regional or national winners - in your kitten's background. Beware a pedigree that has lots of cats that have no cattery names prefixing the ancestors. And these titles do mean something = that the cat has been repeatedly judged, by several different judges, to meet the standard of the MC. At least one of your kitten's parents, if not both, should have a title. One exception - the two major cat associations (CFA and TICA) do not recognize each other's titles, so you may see one side of the CFA pedigree totally devoid of titles - since the ancestors were shown only in TICA and may have been the best cats in the country in that organization.<query> what is the cat pedigree</query> But ask for an explanation. 3. What are the health problems of this breed? A bad answer is ""none"" - it's just not true. As in all pedigreed animals, the MC has some potential inherited problems. The breeder should not only identify these breed health problems, but should tell you what they are doing to try to prevent these things from happening in their offspring. This is one reason the established show/breeders stay in touch - we share information freely and often. BYB's may tell you that the breed is perfectly healthy and that there is no problem. This is equivalent to the used-car salesmen telling you the car was only driven by an old lady to church on Sundays. Beware. If you ask a BYB ""how much Heidi Ho is in your pedigrees?"" they will answer Huh?<query> what is the health of a heidi ho</query> There's nothing wrong with Heidi Ho pedigrees, but they were used extensively early in the development of the MC, and most breeders are careful to identify how much of this line is in their cats. They will look at you askance if you ask this question, but will have an answer. BYB's will have no idea what you are talking about 4. How old will the kitten be before it comes home? Ten weeks is minimum, most breeders hold kittens until 12 weeks or maybe longer. MC's are a slow developing breed, and need a long period of nurturing from both their mothers and breeders. Kittens develop their sense of bonding with humans between 2 and l0 weeks of age - it's wrong to break their bond to their FIRST ""human"" - the breeder - any earlier. They also have not developed their immune systems or had their necessary shots before l0 weeks of age.<query> how old do kittens have to be to be adopted</query> Any breeder selling kittens younger than this is more interested in moving the kittens out and getting the money than in raising healthy, stable, happy kittens. At about l2-l3 weeks, a MC kitten is going to be gaining a quarter to half pound a week, and is confident and ready to bounce right into its new home with confidence. Don't worry - they may be ""big"", but they are still ""babies""! 5. Will the kitten be registered? It's kind of silly to have a purebred cat and not register it - the cost is less than $l0. Generally, the breeder will provide the ""blue slip"", or official registration, when you notify the breeder that the kitten has been neutered. 6. Will I get a contract and written health warranty?<query> how much does it cost to breed a kitten</query> You should. And read the contract specifications carefully. Most breeders will be requiring that the kitten be kept strictly indoors, not declawed, not shown without permission, and neutered at a specific age. Another clause in most contracts is that this kitten may not be transferred to anyone else without obtaining the breeder's permission (hey, we interviewed YOU!)...and that, if for some reason you cannot keep this cat in the future, the breeder must be given the opportunity to take the cat back and assist in finding it a new home. This is because a nightmare to a legitimate breeder would be to find out that one of his/her cherished kittens ended up in a pound. This should never, ever happen. Your health warranty will spell out your rights. State laws vary, but most warranties will cover a specific period of time for which the breeder remains liable.<query> can you keep a cat without permission</query> Check carefully over the specfics - and ask the breeder if you have questions about it. 7. What if I want a show cat? Most breeders are happy to mentor someone through the show process, once you have demonstrated a true commitment to the time and money required. The best way to do this is to buy a ""show quality cat"", neuter it, and show it in premiership ( the neutered cat equivalent to championship). If you get hit with the show bug, you'll have a lot of contacts and experience if you then decide to go ahead and establish a breeding program. 8. What if I want to breed? A BYB will be happy to sell you breeding rights to the cat for extra money. Don't do it. First, you will find it impossible to find a stud cat for your female from a legitimate breeder to breed to.<query> how to breed a cat</query> These may be people who truly love their animals, but have started out with pet quality cats (perhaps purchased from a pet shop) that they breed together. They don't register the offspring, show their cats, or maintain any contact with the breeding community at large. They do not necessarily provide the same level of research into health issues, breeding their cats to the accepted Standards established for this breed, or socializing their kittens. They have no intention of improving the breed, and they have no network of other breeders to contact to help resolve a problem. Their pricing may be the same as that of reputable breeders - but people end up paying for a cat with questionable heritage, that may or may not resemble a purebred MC, with no knowledge of what health issues may be lurking in the ancestry of the cat.<query> what is purebred cat</query> The converse is, no legitimate breeder is going to want to obtain stud service from your male either. Legitimate breeders get these calls all the time - and none of us believe in just plain"" breeding for the sake of breeding"". We think that the majority of breeding cats should be titled - and the chance of you having gotten a true show quality cat from a BYB is about zero. You will not have had a mentor with experience with the established show/breeding community, and by selling you breeding rights, the BYB has created another BYB - you! If you really think you want to be a breeder, then you need to do a lot of research and learning, and you need to do that by becoming involved in the established community of breeders and exhibitors. You will also find that being a BYB is difficult, with an educated public.<query> what is the difference between a byb and a stud cat</query> This is not a way to make money, and the ""joy"" of having kittens around is balanced - sometimes inequitably - with the tragedies. It takes a strong stomach to survive the bad times. If you are SURE you want to be a breeder, then get the very best start you can, by working with the very best breeder you can find, to mentor you and help you along. 9. Do you give your own shots? This answer can surely be ""yes"", but be careful. Many experienced breeders give their own shots, but they should also be making sure that each kitten has at least one veterinary exam before it goes. In some states, health certificates must be obtained from the vet before the kitten can be sold. Don't buy a kitten that has not been examined by a veterinarian.<query> do you give kitten shots</query> Back to the used car example, you definitely would want a mechanic to check the car out first to make sure no serious damage already exists! And finally, there are surely Questions the Breeder Should Ask You! A good breeder is trying hard to make sure that the kittens get great new parents, and that the parents get an affectionate, healthy and beautiful kitten that fits into their lifestyle. They will want to know if you have children - and if so, how old are the kids and what is their experience with animals so far? Do you have other pets? How did you lose your last cat? Are any of the cats in your home allowed outdoors? Do you have a veterinarian? Don't be surprised if some of the questions seem personal - these kittens are not commodities to the reputable breeder.<query> what questions should a kitten breeder ask</query> They are little lives that we have planned, assisted in their births, raised with love, and probably have slept on our heads for the past three months. We want to make sure they are going to great new homes, or we would prefer to keep them ourselves. Beware the breeder who asks you no questions - because it is obvious that they are more concerned with the money than in giving a kitten a fabulous new home, and the parents a fabulous new fur child. Absolutely Cats accepts responsible cat breeders who have registered catteries in good faith and assumes that cat breeders want to offer only high quality, healthy cats and kittens. Absolutely Cats assumes no responsibility for any unethical dealings and you may wish to contact several cat breeders before purchasing a kitten or cat. Please remember that the material and photographs on these pages are protected by copyright law.<query> who is absolutely cats</query> See following section on ""Questions to Ask the Breeder"" and ""Visiting a Cattery"" for some ways to make sure you are dealing with a reputable breeder. The very best place to find a MC kitten is by attending a cat show in your area. Nope, the kittens themselves may not be there, but the most important thing is finding a breeder that you trust and want to work with. You can find out about cat shows in your area by reviewing the show schedule in Cat Fancy magazine, or by calling the Cat Fancier's Association (CFA), who can refer you to shows and breeders in your area. The phone number is (732) 528-9797 Cats are also advertised in various magazines - Cat Fancy, Cats USA, Cats, and in the local newspapers. Many legitimate breeders advertise in all of these publications, but there may also be BYB's - so you will need to ask plenty of questions first.<query> where can i find a mc kitten</query> Another referral source is the Maine Coon Breeder's and Fancier's Association, or MCBFA. Contact Deborah Hall, Corresponding Secretary, at 4405 Karrol SW, Albuquerque NM 87121. They will not recommend specific breeders, but will send you a list of breeders in the area that belong to MCBFA. That doesn't mean that only MCBFA breeders are ""reputable"", but most are reliable. Again, you need to ask your questions. How Much Does a Maine Coon Kitten Cost? This varies greatly depending on the area. Generally, the kittens are more expensive on the East and West Coasts, less in the Midwest. In the New York area, pet quality kittens range from $400 - $l000. And you DO want a pet quality kitten. Good breeders have a long waiting list from other established breeders for top show quality kittens, and are unwilling to sell their ""cream of the crop"" kittens to pet homes.<query> how much do coons cost</query> Beware any breeder who tells you that every kitten they produce is a ""Top Show Quality"" kitten. However, feel free to ask the breeder to show you the difference between pet and show - you'll be surprised. This has nothing to do with size, beauty, or temperament. The factors that determine the difference are so slight that only experienced breeders and judges can distinguish - and even then, most breeders agonize over whether or not they are making the correct evaluation. This difference could mean that the tail is an inch too short, or has a slight kink. A white spot on the chest, ears or eyes set a fraction of an inch too close or far apart, eyes that slant just slightly too far up or down, even just the expression in a cat's face....these make cats ""pets"" rather than ""show"".<query> what is the difference between a cat and a cat show</query> You may actually prefer the pets to the show cats! Sometimes, the kitten IS technically ""perfect"" (or close), but the breeder just does not want that particular ""look"" to represent their cattery, or they may have a breeding restriction set down by the breeders of the kitten's parents. But ask to see the difference - you'll be surprised. Pet Quality kittens are certainly not inferior cats. The price of the kitten will probably include the first two FVRCP vaccinations, and at least one veterinary exam given before it leaves the breeder. Shipping costs will be extra. You will be expected to provide a carrier and a mandatory vet visit under most contracts. Why Are Kittens So Expensive (a common, but often unasked, question) While BYB's and pet shops may make money selling kittens, most legitimate breeders do not even cover their own costs.<query> what is the cost of a kitten</query> It's a very expensive hobby. Most of us WISH we could just break even, but can't. It may look like a gold mine to you, but let's go through the expenses involved and you'll see that turning a profit would be a rare event for a breeder. We do this for love of cats, not money (and most of us hide the REAL expenses from our spouses!). As an example, buying a top show quality female, with breeding rights (which may have restrictions on how we can sell the kittens), may cost $800 to more than $l000. Males are more. Showing her to the preliminary title of ""Champion"" can add another $500-$2000 to the investment. Showing a male or female to the title of Grand Champion, or Regional/National Winner, can be from $1000 to more than $20,000!<query> how much does it cost to breed a cat</query> Maintenance, supplies and veterinary care generally cost breeders about $500 per cat per year. By the time a cat is first bred, at about a year old, the breeder will have invested several thousand dollars. Then there is a stud fee for the breeding, which may be $500 - $l000 per litter. Kitten shots cost breeders about $l00 per kitten - and that's if there are NO problems to be treated. Kittens stay with breeders for 3 months or so, and have to be fed, cuddled, and cleaned-up-after for all that time. Separate, special areas of the house are often customized for the cats to use as a cattery or nursery - and some cattery set-ups cost $5,000 or more to build. If all goes well, fat healthy kittens are born - but there are always the disasters, such as C-sections that run $750 and up.<query> how much does it cost to breed a cat</query>"

I have worked with stallions who were allowed to interact normally with other horses, turned out in green pastures to play, and given demanding work schedules at high levels of training. These horses were intelligent, sane and an absolute pleasure to work with. I have also been in a barn where every one of the horses demonstrated neurotic behavior. These poor animals were so carefully protected in the name of performance in the show ring that their lives consisted of little more than being held hostage in a beautifully maintained cell. A review of child development books and theories reveals that an important key to well adjusted, productive and healthy children is a wide ranging exposure to a variety of people and relationships, environments, activities and ideas.<query> what is neurotic behavior in horses</query> It is hard to imagine any rational person advocating that children be isolated and sensory deprived so that they could achieve better grades or respond more perfectly to their parent's desires. And it takes very little imagination to grasp what the effects of such isolation might be on the average child. Consider the concept that dogs should have limited, if any, play or social interactions with other dogs. The rationale here is that a dog dealing with another dog must either be dominant or submissive. In having to learn the rules of normal dog behavior, these trainers believe that these dogs will have their fragile egos irreparably damaged by having to submit to other dogs, or become unduly dominant, thus rendering them incapable of successful competitive work. Does this really make sense? What happened to stable dogs who can actually deal with life?<query> why do dogs have to be dominant</query> I read one article where the author carefully explained how each new group of dogs required a sorting of social hierarchy, and that if the that group changed at all, the dogs would need to sort it out all over again. What a surprise! Every time you (also a social animal subject to power structures and dominance hierarchies) enter a room of other people, the same process repeats itself. It is through such repeated interactions and sorting that you come to some sense of who you are no matter what group you are in. The most confident dogs I know are dogs who extremely well socialized, and able to handle themselves in almost any setting. There is a grain of truth here - a very small grain at best. There is no question that an inappropriate playmate can scare the pants off a dog (especially a puppy), sometimes leaving a serious and lasting impression.<query> why are dogs so confident</query> There is no question that a dog who is an absolute bully with other dogs may make a lousy competitive dog - lacking respect or sense or both, no doubt he could be found wanting when it comes to respecting and cooperating with a human. But the larger truth here is that a normal dog who is properly and thoroughly socialized, allowed to develop appropriate manners, and who knows when to politely bow deep and when to hold his head high is a dog who is not easily shaken by odd encounters. What these trainers fear most of all is that their dog will come to prefer dogs as playmates rather than the handler. They will even tell you this in no uncertain language. My question is, if the dog would rather play with another dog than work with you, doesn't that tell you something? If your spouse preferred to spend his/her weekends with another man/woman, wouldn't that be a clue?<query> what is a dog that is a playmate</query> Let's pretend that you adore checkers, and attend every checkers tournament that comes to town. One day, you decide that your child/spouse/friend (choose one) should also enjoy checkers as you do. As you sit enraptured by the fine points of multiple jumps, your guest sees a squirrel in the tree outside the window. ""Gosh,"" he/she says as they leap from their seat, ""I didn't realize there were squirrels around here!"" And off they go to stare up a tree, finding this much more fun than watching checkers with you. BIG hint there, eh? It is possible to have a relationship based on mutual respect, free from anything that remotely resembles sensory deprivation, and still have a dog who will work his heart out for you and even more importantly, with you.<query> can you have a dog with you</query> Since I do not choose to compete in the obedience ring, there are some readers who, mistakenly equating titles achieved with knowledge earned, will question my basis for this statement. In my many years of involvement with dogs, it is the two plus years of working with my dog as a Search & Rescue team that has taught me the most about what is possible between a dog and a human in a working relationship. On our first official search, what few joys the formal obedience ring held for me evaporated in a moonlit cornfield somewhere in Pennsylvania as I watched my dog work and work and work, with me, off lead under bizarre circumstances. . . until the sun came up. I have watched my search partner, a young German Shepherd named Chilkat, play sticks and ""keep away"" with other dogs in the search unit as we prepare for a practice search.<query> what kind of dog is chilkat</query> A quiet whistle or call brings him to me instantly ready for work, which means a scent discrimination exercise that could last up to two hours in pouring rain, freezing cold or blistering heat. Walking through a park with 7 off lead dogs, I have sent a friend to hide, and without having to dispose of the other dogs, put Chilkat on a formal search command. He is at work in a flash, ignoring even the puppy's attempts to restart their game of a moment ago. In both cases, when his job is done, Chilkat happily returns to playing with the other dogs, groveling appropriately to his elders or giving a pesty puppy notice that her manners are somewhat lacking. On real searches, I have hiked over strange farm fields in the middle of the night, watching my dog ignore other dogs, farm animals, even rabbits and deer that flushed under his very feet.<query> what is chilkat's job</query> I have watched him work for four straight hours on a mountaintop after an hour's climb (past a black bear and cubs) to our start point. His only failing in that working situation was his refusal to rest more than three minutes, a fact my weary legs found nearly unforgivable! The notion of having to artificially insure that my dogs found me incredibly interesting disturbs me. If I ever found myself in any relationship with a healthy being (human, canine, equine, or any other species) where I had to cajole, bribe, pay or take hostage my intended pal in order to assure their interest in me, I'd have to take a very long hard look in the mirror. In the case of unhealthy or unbalanced beings, such as very sick or emotionally disturbed animals or people, I have indeed made unusual foods, exciting games and/or extra attention my opening bids in the friendship game.<query> why do dogs keep their interest in me</query> And I did so with full recognition that as they were at that moment, a normal relationship was not possible, and that I chose to interact with them in an unbalanced way. But I did not withhold normal food, access to independent play or playmates, or my attention. That is not a relationship, or a friendship. It may be an appropriate interaction between organism and source of stimuli, but I need more from dogs than simple, conditioned responses. I have dogs first and foremost as my friends, and I do my damnedest to treat them as such. I often fail to be as generous and unflagging a friend to my dogs as they are to me. But I'm learning. The dog is commonly referred to as ""man's best friend."" I wish that dogs could talk, if only to gain their perspective on what that really means for them.<query> what is the relationship between a dog and a human</query> Perhaps, like the hostages in Stockholm, some of our dogs would find themselves pleading for leniency for their captors.

Then this article is for you!! The ""pit bull"" dog movement has become so entrenched in the idea of ""protecting"" the dogs and operating out of fear/worst-case-scenarios that we sometimes end up denying ""pit bull"" dogs the the basic experiences and socialization that every dog needs and deserves. In a self-fulfilling prophecy, we become so consumed with fear that we end up creating the very same behaviors we wanted to prevent. This is not protection. Surely there are some dogs (of all breeds) who will never exist peacefully with other dogs, regardless of how much socialization and training is done, but those dogs are the minority.<query> why are pitbull dogs considered pets</query> It's time to stop letting fear dictate our ""protection"" of ""pit bull"" dogs. This article, although intended for any breed/mix of dog, offers some great food for thought. (Above caption taken from Animal Farm's facebook page https://www.facebook.com/animalfarmfoundation) Of Hostages & Relationships Do you need to isolate a dog or limit playtime with other dogs or people? by Suzanne Clothier He said that he loved her. He said that his relationship with her mattered almost more than anything else in his life. He said that he enjoyed working with her, and sharing new ideas. To be sure, she never took her eyes off his face, paying no heed to the audience who waited breathlessly to hear his secrets for such adoration, such undivided attention. ""First"", he said, ""I never let her talk to anyone but me.<query> what kind of dog is a pit bull</query> When I leave for work, I lock her in a room, which is pretty boring for her, but when I get home - oh, is she ever glad to see me! If she wants to do anything, except go to the bathroom, she has to do it with me. I control her food, her exercise and all her activities. Wherever we go, I insist that she always look at me, so I know for sure she's paying absolute attention. I don't let her have any friends, because they might distract her or use up the energy she needs for working. Being the only social contact she has, I am very important to her. Naturally, she'd rather be with me than anyone else."" The audience didn't gasp. They didn't protest in any way.<query> why do i lock my daughter in a room</query> They didn't stand up and tell him that was archaic, outrageous treatment. They did not shout out that this was not, could not be, the secret of a healthy, happy relationship. Instead, they nodded, and took notes. They thought this made perfect sense. Was this some sensationalistic talk show featuring, ""Taking A Hostage - Key to a Happy Relationship?"" Unfortunately, it was not Geraldo or Sally. This was a dog training seminar, and ""he"" was talking about ""her"" - his dog. (And while I say ""he"", this attitude is certainly not limited to male trainers but applies equally to female trainers.) If this had been a man talking about his wife, or a mother discussing how she raised her kids, the audience would have been, rightfully, appalled.<query> who is taking hostage</query> But it was, after all, only a dog, and these were techniques helpful to top competitive performance. If we examine the theories behind the methodology, we come up with some pretty scary notions. While long appalled by the notion of needing to isolate a dog to improve his willingness to work with you, I began to wonder why this concept not only was ""successful"" (if, in defining success you are willing to discard a healthy, normal relationship and focus only on competitive performance) but sounded vaguely familiar. The answer? ""The Stockholm Syndrome,"" a psychological phenomenon named after the people in a Stockholm bank who were held hostage. In this syndrome, those forcibly taken hostage, surprisingly, develop positive feelings for their captors. To understand the Stockholm Syndrome, you must understand the effects of sensory deprivation.<query> what is stockholm syndrome</query> Imagine, if you can, being forcibly removed from your daily life (with all its familiar environments, routines and social interactions) and put in a strange place from which you cannot escape. Your only interactions are with your captors, whose behavior can be capricious - that is, beyond your ability to understand why or when they may choose to do something for you, with you or to you. They may withhold food and/or water, in order to raise its value to you in order to receive your compliance with their demands. You may be left in complete silence or darkness with nothing to do, nowhere to go. You may not be allowed to talk or interact with other prisoners. It would appear that a reasonable (human) response to this would be anger. To be sure, this is often the initial response of any hostage.<query> what is the capricious behavior of a hostage</query> Yet, as the hostages in the Stockholm bank demonstrated, the desire for survival quickly supercedes hostility. Your entire world now revolves around your captor(s), and within the sensory vacuum in which you now exist, their moods and actions become all consuming. Anticipating their desires, appeasing them - these are the possible keys to survival. Further, deprived of normal social interaction, you begin to see your captors more sympathetically. In the original Swedish case, investigators were astonished to hear the freed hostages asking for leniency for their captors. For any social creature (man, whales, gorillas, wolves, horses, dogs, chimpanzees, dolphins), the quickest way to create neurosis and abnormal behaviors is social isolation and a sterile sensory environment. Within the zoological community, the greatest success rates in terms of animal mortality, health and normal breeding and rearing of offspring occurs with animals who are allowed normal social groups and interactions, and whose environments are as varied and rich as a zoo can manage to provide.<query> what is the quickest way to create neurosis in animals</query>"

Setting the grill temperature within the proper range and keeping it there is the first step in excellent grilled food. Learn to use your vents to raise and lower the temperature. Opening vents further allows more air to get to the coals, heating the fire up. Pushing vents further toward the closed position reduces air, decreasing the fire heat. Remember, your vents only open and close a few inches. Small adjustments can make big differences in the internal temperature. You need to learn where and how to stack the coals for the type of cooking you will be doing. For indirect grilling, you do not want the coals directly under the food.<query> how to adjust the temperature on a charcoal grill</query> Place coals in a pile or a couple of groupings in the grill, not directly under the food. This allows the meat to cook slowly and not sear on the outside before it is done on the inside. Placing a pan of water in the grill will add moisture. Wood chips and herbs can also add flavor while grilling. Soak the wood chips for about 30 minutes before adding to the coals. This will allow the wood to smoke without flaming up and burning away. For longer cooking times, use wood chunks instead. These need to be soaked for about two hours before being placed on the grill. Trial and error is, unfortunately, part of the learning process of grilling with charcoal. Begin with less expensive cuts of meat. Once you learn to control the temperature and grill environment, start working your way up to more expensive meats and foods.<query> how long to soak wood chips before grilling</query> Choosing the correct cut of meat and the best cooking process for that cut is crucial in the outcome of the meal. When grilling beef, higher fat content is actually better. Much of the fat will melt and drip off the meat, adding moisture and flavor as it cooks. What you do not want in a cut of meat is a huge ring of fat. You want to look for cuts that have marbling. Marbling is very thin strips of fat working a pattern throughout the meat. This is the secret for tender, juicy steaks. Pork is well served by brining before grilling. Soak the pork for several hours or overnight in a solution of salt water. Brining will tenderize the pork and help it to stay moist. Most cuts of pork are more suited to low and slow cooking than hot, fast grilling like steak.<query> what is the best cut of meat to grill</query>"

Gas Smokers: Buying Guide, Reviews, Ratings, and Recommendations By Meathead Bottom line: If you are looking for set it forget it simplicity and good flavor, go gas. Bonus: They are cheap! Gas fueled smokers are almost as easy to use as electric smokers. They produce a lot of clean heat, and that's why gassers are so popular with restaurants. The smoke flavor comes from wood chips, chunks, or pellets. Most consumer units use propane tanks. Alas, I have never seen one set up for natural gas nor have I seen them offered with an optional natural gas conversion kit. You may be able to adapt yours to run on NG, but this must be done by a professional unless your goal is to be charred on the outside and rare on the center.<query> what kind of gas do you use for smokers</query> It is much easier to control the temperature of a gasser that a charcoal or wood fueled smoker, and this isvery important. Propane gassers don't require access to electricity as do pellet and electric smokers. This makes them more portable. For some reason, all the models I have played with tend to run hot, in the 250 to 275°F range on the lowest setting. I think ideal temp for low slow smoking is 225°F, but most meats do just fine at the higher temp. Not ideal, but not bad. If you want to drive down the temp a bit, try ice in the water pan or leaving the door slightly ajar. This wastes fuel, but should do the job. Bruce Swiecicki, Senior Technical Advisor of the National Propane Association says ""You might be able to control the flame by turning the cylinder valve, but the flame may be unsteady.<query> what temp should a propane smoker be</query> I don't know of any safety issues to look out for."" You need to keep spare tanks on hand because they have a nasty habit of running out right in the middle of a five hour cooking session. If the tank is running low, you need to check up on it every 30 minutes to be sure the flame is not as dead as your pig. This is a bit of a pain, especially when you undertake the smoking a nine pound butt for pulled pork, a cooking session that could take 18 hours. For sure it will croak at 2 a.m. If your tank is running low, it's a good idea to remove it and hook a fresh tank when you start. This practice leaves you with several partially filled tanks in the garage. Grrrrr. When the tank is empty, you can take it to one of many gas stations, convenience stores, drug stores, or groceries that let you swap for a full tank for an empty plus $13 to 20.<query> how long does it take to cook a pulled pork</query> There is also a small safety issue. There is an open flame, and the flame is sometimes in a place where a child or dog could get into it by mistake. For an article on handling propane and propane safety, click here. The biggest drawback to these smokers is that they are usually too narrow to fit a full slab of ribs or a whole brisket on a shelf. You can cut them in half, or hang them. To hang them you need to be creative. I use metal shower curtain hooks and hang them from a shelf in the top position. Another option is to drill holes in the sides near the top and put in some dowels. Starting in 2009, the market has seen a number of similar El Cheapo Chinese-made cabinet style gassers in the under $200 range. They are thin metal and the doors are loose so they leak heat and smoke which means you will burn more wood chips than on airtight units.<query> what is the drawback of a propane smoker</query> But it really doesn't impact food quality. They are all very similar and are worth your consideration, especially if quality food and ease of use is a high priority. They don't come with a cover or a propane tank so factor them into your price. They are also small, so you will want at least tworib racks in order to pack in enough to feed all the people who will come sniffin around. The thermometers are worthless and can be off as much as 30°F, and this is the case on most grills and smokers, so plan on gettinga good digital thermometer. And remember, always leave the top vent open all the way to prevent soot and creosote buildup on your meat. One other word of caution. I love the flavor of meat from propane smokers, but it isa tiny bit different than the taste of meat from a charcoal smoker.<query> what temperature should a propane smoker be</query> The combustion gasses combine with the moisture and the wood smoke and produce a fragrance and flavor that is sometimes reminiscent of bacon. Purists who compete on the BBQ circuit where gas isverboten complain about this undertone, but I say, just what's wrong with a little bacon? Click the red links for current pricing and more info. Brinkmann All-In-One Gas & Charcoal Smoker/Grill/Fryer A cheapo versatile bullet that is best when cooking with gas, but can be adapted to cook with charcoal, and can be used as a smoker, brazier, or deep fryer. This was my first smoker, and it lasted several years although the base eventually rusted out and the aluminum firebox corroded. The thermometer is cheap. Adding water is awkward because it must be poured from the top and can easily get on the food or the lava rocks.<query> what kind of smoker is best for charcoal</query> Adding wood is downright dangerous because the whole upper unit must be slid partially aside. The newer Masterbuilt 7-in-One (below) is modeled on this unit, only a lot better for little more money. List price is about $180. For discount pricing and direct ordering from Amazon.com,click here. Brinkmann Vertical Gas Smoker I like to smoke at 225°F and my Brinkmann runs at a steady 270°F on low on an 80°F summer day, and 230°F on high on a winter day when it was 20°F with no wind. Although it has a small footprint, 17"" deep x 17.5"" wide x 42"" high plus space for the propane tank, it has three racks each capable of holding a slab of ribs split in half, a turkey, or a Boston butt. If you usewire rib racks.<query> what temperature does a brinkmann vertical smoker run at</query> you can fit six slabs of ribs in. There is no damper, but you really don't need one. You just leave the chimney open and control the temp with the gas gauge. The water and wood each go in separate removable porcelain pans. Camp Chef Smoke Vault There are two models. Both are 16"" deep and 44"" high (the cooking chambers are 30"" high), while one is 18"" wide with a footprint 24"" wide by 21"" deep, and the other is 24"" wide with a footprint of 30"" wide and 21"" deep. If you are going to cook full racks of ribs, the 24"" unit is the better choice. Both feature a 20,000 BTU propane burner, a stainless steel water pan, a cast iron wood chip box, four removable racks, and a push button ignitor.<query> how deep is the grill for ribs</query> The 24"" unit lists for about $420.

GoGalley GoGalley is unlike any other grill in the world. It is a four burner gas grill with a serious side burner, and a built-in cabinet-style smoker/oven that is as good as any on this page. Smoke your ribs, grill burgers, bake cookies, and fry a turkey, all in one portable unit. The whole shootin' match folds up, attaches to a trailer hitch, and has a built-in hoist that lifts it up so you can haul it anywhere. Solidly built, it is a fine backyard setup, and it is the best rig I've ever seen for tailgating or camping.<query> what is the best gas grill</query> I have tested it andI review it in detail on the page devoted to portable grills. Great Outdoors Smoky Mountain Series This is a good smoker, but buyer beware! There are two models that I have seen of this cabinet-style front loading gasser, but I hear reports of a number of slightly different sizes and configurations depending on where you buy. Apparently the manufacturer makes them custom for several retailers, a photo of one of them is shown at the top of this page.. There is a narrow body that is about 16"" wide x 15"" deep x 35"" high on the inside and about 44"" tall on the outside ant a 13,500 BTU burner. The bigger one, users call it the ""Big Block"", stands about 48"" high and is a capacious 24"" wide x 15"" deep x 35"" high cooking chamber and a 18,000 BTU burner.<query> what size gasser for smoker</query> The 24"" has five rack positions and four chrome plated racks. This means it is wide enough for any slab of ribs and can handle up to eight slabs. Ten if you buy an additional rack. It has has a cast brass burner, electronic ignition, three adjustable dampers, a cool grip front door handle that is a bit awkward, a porcelain coated water pan, and a cast iron box for wood. I have heard of people replacing the cast iron box with a cut down coffee can because the cast iron took too long to heat up. I often hear users complain that workmanship is poor, that it leaks around the welds, and the door does not seal tightly, but they don't worry because it seems to operate best when all the dampers are open and the extra airflow doesn't hurt.<query> how many racks on a cast iron coffee can</query> Wide stance legs offer good stability and the flame is set where it is not likely to set fire to the dog's tail. There is a temperature gauge located near the center of the door. As with most other thin metal uninsulated units, it gets hot on the outside, especially on the bottom. Users recommend that you put an aluminum pan beneath it to catch grease and protect your deck. One has put tuna cans under the legs to catch drips. Other users have replaced the water pan with a larger capacity stainless steel mixing bowl. The manual has minimal instructions and recipes. The manufacturer, CFM Home Products of Canada, has no info on these smokers on its website. Nor do they respond promptly to emails. I get emails all the time from people who need spare parts or the manual and the manufacturer is no help.<query> what to put under a cfm smoker</query> Frustrated users have one-upped the manufacturer by forming a support group with some knowledgeable cooks who have lots of good advice and ideas, recipes, modifications, and tips on techniques. Here's a link to theSmoky Mountain group on Yahoo. Another word of caution: Before you take it home, open the box. I have heard reports of customers being disappointed by missing parts. Regardless of the poor workmanship, it is easy to use, works great, and the price is right, hence my ""Gold Award."" The 16"" unit lists for about $100. The 24"" unit sells for only $130. For discount pricing and direct ordering for the 16"" model from Amazon.com,click here. For pricing on the 24"" model from Amazon.com,click here. Landmann Smoky Mountain 2-Drawer Propane Smoker Yet another of the cabinet ilk, this has three doors, one for the cooking chamber, and two drawers below, one for wood and one for water.<query> how much does a smoky mountain smoker cost</query> I haven't used it but readers send me positive feedback on it. TheLandmann is available on Amazon.com. Masterbuilt 7-in-One Smoker This is my favorite of the bullet-shaped water smokers because it is so versatile, but bottom line, I like the cabinet style better. You can use either gas or charcoal as fuel. It converts into a brazier or a tripod for boiling water or deep frying and it comes with a 10.5 quart aluminum pot and basket. Like most bullets, it uses an enamel water/drip pan to put moisture into the cooking chamber. It has a small door at the bottom so you can add wood chips or fill the water pan and a damper at the top to help control air flow. Made of thin stainless steel, the lid dents easily and the plastic handle breaks easily if dropped.<query> what kind of water smoker is best</query> A clerk in one store told me that he has had to replace the handle on his floor model several times just because it is knocked off by tire-kickers. It is the only bullet I have seen with a side shelf for trays or tools. Like all bullets, it is not insulated, and there is no wind shield around the burner, so cold temps, wind, and rain will make it hard to maintain constant temps. If you buy this smoker, immediately go get yourself a good thermometer. The thermometer that comes with it sucks. The two 15.5"" cooking grates are just a bit too small for some large slabs. To get max capacity, I have to cut slabs in half, but I can get eight half slabs on it easily. You can also roll the slabs and get about six slabs on this way.<query> how many slabs on a smoked rib</query> It is similar to the popular Weber Smoky Mountain, which burns only charcoal, but the Weber is built from heavier metal with an enamel finish. Electronic ignition. Lists for about $130 for the black enamel and $325 for the stainless with the shelf (above). For discount pricing and direct ordering for the black enamel from Amazon.com,click here. For the stainless model, click here. Master Forge Double Door Propane Gas Smoker I haven't yet used this model but it looks very similar to the Brinkmann with the double door design that lets you access the wood chips without opening the food access. One reader says he has had no trouble dialing it down to 225°F or below. It is sold only at Lowe's. Vermont Castings Propane Gas Smoker Double-walled cabinet with a brushed stainless steel exterior 36"" high x 24"" wide x 16"" deep.<query> what is the price of a weber smoker</query> Cast brass burner with electronic ignition. Silicon gel door gasket with cool grip locking door handle and heavy duty carrying handles. Wide stance. Cast iron wood chip box and porcelain coated water pan. Propane only, tank not included. Lists for about $650. Be my Friend Follow on Twitter My posts on Google+ Read me in HuffPost My free email newsletter My current RSS feed Read this before posting a comment please: 1) If you are looking for info, please use the table of contents or the search box, at the top of every page. 2) Don't ask me any questions that involve temp or time unless you tell me that you are using a digital thermometer! Bi-metal dial thermometers are often off by as much as 50°F! If you are not using a good digital you have no idea what the temp really is so I can't help you.<query> what is the temperature on a cast iron water heater</query> I don't care how much you spent on your grill, the bi-metal dial thermometer that came with it is probably cheap and unreliable and likely to be off by as much as 50°F. Worse still, it is in the dome, and the temp down on the grate where the meat sits is much different. Like a musician, you must master your instrument to make great food. How much gas is left? There are a number of gauges that go between the tank and the hose, but the two I've tried didn't work. Another option is theGrill Gauge (at right) which is not much more than a glorified fish scale. An empty tank weight 20 pounds, and a full one is 40 pounds. Hoist your tank and the gauge gives you a pretty good guestimate of how much is left.<query> how many pounds is a full tank</query> I take mine when I exchange empty tanks for full ones. You'd be surprised how many are underfiulled. Here's the least expensive gauge: Take a quart of warm water and pour it slowly over the side of the tank. It will warm the metal where the tank is empty and the metal where the liquid propane remains will remain cold. Run you hand down the side to locate the liquid level. Of course you do have a backup tank, don't you? And you do backup you computer don't you (one copy on premises and one copy off premises)? Pimp your gasser Part of the fun of a cheap cooker is modifying it. Usually the mods aren't as good as buying a high end cooker built right from the get go, but all the gassers I've seen are cheap and can use some help.<query> how to check propane tank temperature</query> Turn down the heat. Most of the gassers run hot. An enterprising reader named Tanner has devised a few mods for his gas smoker that make a lot of sense to me. He has installed a$9 needle valve between the regulator and the burner. He says that even though there are no marks on the valve, 1/8 turn knocks back 15°F. Installation was a bit of a pain: ""Channel locks and vice grips failed at the initial unscrewing and I had to use a bench mounted vice to grip the parts."" Water supply. Tanner also added a larger water pan, while reader Marty Smith installed a copper water line with a funnel on top. Seal the door. Some readers have made their smoker more efficient. Frankly, since mine runs hot, I like the fact that it leaks, but if you feel the need to tighten up, you can put a gasket around the door.<query> how to make a gas smoker run hot</query> Rutland Gasket Kits and Gore-Tex Gasket Tape are good options. There are several options so pay attention to thickness and max temp. Another option is Rutland High Temp Silicone Sealant or use a high temp auto silicone that is rated for 500°F or more. You can make a really thin bead around the door rim or the smoker body where the door contacts it. Lay a thin strip of kitchen wax paper or kitchen parchment paper (which is actually silicon impregnated) on top of the bead. Gently close the doors until the goo spreads out and the paper makes contact with the opposite surface all around. Open the door and let the goo set. Peel off the paper. The sealant can be trimmed with a knife. Rutland Products are in hardware stores, furnace and wood stove stores, and online. Install a better thermometer.<query> how to seal rustland door</query>"

""hdc1""--third IDE hard drive, first partition, etc. SCSI drives have analogous names but start with the letters ""sd"" (=""SCSI drive""), followed by the letter indicating the SCSI interface and by the number indicating the SCSI device id. For example, ""sda4"" means ""first SCSI interface, id number 4"".<query> what is the hda1</query> If you have an external zip drive attached to your parallel port, it will appear as SCSI device ""sda4"" (zip drives work in a SCSI-emulation mode). The listing of partitions that your Linux setup program presents to you during installation will include any MS Windows partitions which you have. For example, I have the following MS Windows partition: mount point type size comment [no mount] vfat 1200 MB [""Win C drive, hda1] /mnt/dos_hdd2 vfat 1600 MB [""Win D drive, hdd2] Don't erase these MS Windows partitions during your Linux installation if you want a dual boot. If you erase the MS Windows partition, MS Windows is gone from your system! If not sure, backup your data from your MS Windows partitions before Linux installation. ""msdos"", ""fat"" and ""vfat"" and ""ntfs"" are typical filesystems used by DOS and MS Windows 3.x/95/98/NT.<query> what is linux partition</query> As a quick reference, here is a brief summary of the standard linux partition types (""filesystems"") with a short description. I copied the info from the linux manual pages:man fs and man mount (with some additions after I had a look at the source code files at /usr/src/linux/fs). The underlined filesystems are the ones that you are more likely to use. Other filesystems (not listed below) are available as add-ons (for example journaling filesystems, compressed, encrypted, ...). minix is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks. ext is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.<query> what is the filesystem for linux</query> It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (ext2) and will eventually be removed from the kernel. ext2 is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the filesystems supported under Linux. In short, ext2 is the main (default, typical) Linux filesystem. ext3 is an extension of the ext2 filesystem with journaling. It is backwards and forward compatibile with ext2. It means that ext2 can be converted into ext3 without reformatting or data loss (just re-mounting the partion is required). ext3 can be changed back to ext2, also without data loss. I use ext3 extensively since Oct.2001--it is simple and trouble-free.<query> what is ext3</query> It is included as an installation ""option"" since RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. It is highly recommended that you use this filesystem. xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The xia filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is used infrequently. msdos is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8 characters followed by an optional period and 3 character extension. umsdos is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS. vfat is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.<query> what is msdos</query> VFAT adds capability for long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem. proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take up disk space. Seeman 5 proc. iso9660 is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard. Two extensions (listed below) are automatically supported. High Sierra --Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. Rock Ridge --Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.<query> what is iso9660</query> It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation. sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS. nfs is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers. smb is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by MS Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs. [Standard linux command ""smbmount"" will also do.] ncpfs is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.<query> what is linux smb</query> devpts--is a pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/ . fat --is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems. UFS --is a file system widely used in different operating systems. swap--is a special partition type used for swapping data from memory to hard drive. raiserfs--is a brand new journaling filesystem available as standard with Linux kernel version 2.4.1 up (January 2001). hfs (=hierarchical files system)--MacIntosh filesystem. It is a late beta version. , i.e., not recommended for use with critical data, unless read-only.<query> what is pts</query> ntfs--MS Windows NT filesytem.

Linux Applications • 7. Learn Linux Commands • A. How to Upgrade Kernel? Before Linux installation, you might really want to know what a hard drive partition is. The concern is that you delete your MS Windows partition when you really don't want to--you want two separate partitions to dual boot. This means: MS Windows is on one partition, Linux is on a separate partition. You do not normally install Linux on free space on your MS Windows-allocated partition(s). It is possible to install Linux on a MS Windows partition, but we do not recommend it. If you plan a dual boot (Linux and MS Windows on the same computer), first use your DOS/Win utilityFDISK to make the MS Windows partition(s).<query> what is the partition for linux</query> Leave part of the hard drive(s) unpartitioned for Linux. You will make and format the Linux partitions during your RedHat (or Mandrake or whatever else) installation. Linux will recognize the free space on the harddrive. Make the MS Windows partition ""primary"" and ""bootable"". Install, configure, and test your MS Windows before Linux installation. If you plan to run Linux only, you need just a clean hard drive (no partitions) to start with. It is possible to have only one Linux partition (plus one for MS Windows if you dual-boot). But it is better to have more partitions so that you can keep users' data separate from the rest of the operating system. This way, if something ever goes wrong, or if you have to reformat or re-install the operating system, you don't lose the users' data.<query> how to install linux on a hard drive</query> (You can perform a complete Linux re-install without losing the contents of the /home directory that contains all user data if you skip the ""re-format"" option given to you during installation. But for that, the /home directory must be on its own partition.) During the Linux setup, you will be asked to partition the available space on your hard drive(s). There are many possible ways to partition, depending on your hard drive space, requirements, and taste. I like Linux hard drive partitions like this (for a modest total of 2 GB of hardrive space which I give to Linux in this example): mount point type size / ext2 300 MB /usr ext2 1200 MB /home ext2 380 MB swap swap 120 MB In the above example, I dedicate 300 MB for the root partition that holds the base of the Linux operating system.<query> how much space does linux need</query> I allocate 1200 MB to the mount point that will be visible on my filesystem as the/usr directory and will contain the user's programs (the programs that don't come with the base operating system and I install later, for example StarOffice). I dedicate 380 MB for the partition that will be visible as the directory/home and will contain the setting and data of all users on the machine. And I allocate 120 MB to a ""raw"" partition for the operating system to use as the virtual memory (extension of the physical, silicon memory on the hard drive, so-called swap). If your kernel is lower than 2.2 (this is the case with standard RH5.2 and earlier), your swap partition cannot be larger than approximately 127 MB. The rule of thumb is that the swap should be about twice the amount of the physical memory (RAM).<query> what is the size of a swap partition</query> If you need more (e.g. if you have lots of physical memory, or you expect to run custom programs with really large data structures) you might want to create a larger swap partition during the installation (or several smaller swap partitions) or add a swap file(s) later. 2 GB is a respectible amount of disk space and should be sufficient for users who like having many applications. (This is because Linux applications tend to be slimmer than their MS Windows equivalents). However, if you try to install everything that's available on the modern distribution CDs, you will surely run out of disk space. My experience is that however large the hard drive space, it will get filled and I regret I don't have more :-) . If my space on the hard drive is really restricted, I may consider a two-partition setup like this (for a lean 650 MB total dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 600 MB swap swap 50 MB<query> how much space do i need for linux</query> In this example, I dedicate 600 MB to the base of the operating system, applications, and user documents/data, and allow 50 MB for the swap partition (for the operating system to use as the virtual memory). The 50-MB swap should be quite sufficient for medium duty operations. The limitation of 600 MB for the operating system, applications and user data means that you will have to be very selective as to which applications you install or else you risk running out of hard drive space. Try pressing when installing the optional software that comes on the Red Hat CD--it will give you a short description of what the software does so you could perhaps decide if you really need it. (Don't worry too much if you miss something you need, you can install the missing parts later).<query> how much space does a redhat cd need</query> You can easily finish the RedHat installation with 200 MB free on your Linux partition (out of 600 MB used in this example) if you make reasonable choices. Please note that ""bundling together"" the root partition ""/"" and the /home directory will likely save you some disk space, but it is not the safest solution. It is possible to install Linux on even less disk space than in the example above, but you will have to be really picky as to what you install. For a larger available hard drive space, I may consider the following setup (for a comfortable total of 15 GB dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 800 MB /usr ext2 5000 MB /usr/local ext2 3000 MB /home ext2 5200 MB swap swap 1000 MB Please note that the the mount points can reside on different physical hard drives.<query> how much space do i need to install linux</query> Linux agglomarates all the hard drive space into a single directory tree. Another consideration when setting up the partitions on older computers (486?). Many older BIOSes have the restriction that the boot partition cannot extend beyond the 1024th cylinder on your first physical hard drive. To overcome this limitation, simply make the first (bootable) partition so that it ends before the cylinder number 1023 (this makes this partition max approximately 512 MB in size, which is plenty for the ""/"" root partition). Once Linux boots, the BIOS restriction does not matter any more because Linux takes over the hardware management and it can access the partition(s) beyond the cylinder number 1023. When installing and using Linux, your drives appear as devices with the following names: hda--first IDE drive (stands for ""hard drive a"", i.e. the master drive on the first IDE interface), hdb--second IDE drive (i.e., the slave drive on the first IDE interface), hdc--third IDE drive (i.e. the master drive on the second IDE interface), hdd--fourth IDE drive (i.e. the slave drive on the second IDE interface).<query> what is the partition number for linux</query>"

Another example is games, I'm pretty sure that games like UT2k3 and NWN (which were ported to Linux) sell more because of this. Professional software developers that don't port usually falls into one of these categories: 1. Too lazy 2. They don't program with cross-platformability in mind (i.e. DirectX) 3. Their publisher is a jackass 4. It would cost more money to port it than they would gain from porting it 5. They don't recognize the Linux community I'm not using any of those as an insult.

In the blue, Microsoft corner, the long-awaited Internet Explorer 9 finally made its official appearance. After several months of open testing of beta versions, we got the finished product, promising high performance and a simple interface, ready to ease your work and entertainment on the web. Interface If Internet Explorer 8 was looking after the then-current versions of Firefox in terms of user interface, IE9 is based on the minimalistic philosophy put forward by Google Chrome. All tool and menu bars are gone, replaced with a single bar that contains the address field, tabs and three icons to access all of IE9’s tools and settings. Of course, if you need all the bars, or are just feeling retro, it’s simple enough right-clicking the window surface and restoring a desired bar in its usual place.<query> what is the interface of ie9</query> This graphics interface solution shows that Microsoft has also embraced the viewpoint that the Internet browser is just that - a tool to display web content, and that the browser’s interface must never get in the way of the webpage’s actual content, or even seem dominant; furthermore, users don’t even need the hidden controls most of the time. Besides the visual ones, IE9 also offers many other improvements and tools for quicker and easier web browsing. “Download Manager” is one such tool, and one noticeably lacking in previous versions of Internet Explorer. This download browser is most akin to the Firefox solution - a simple window to enable you to see the list of current and previous downloads, the original location of the file and where it’s been saved on the hard drive etc., as well as to run, stop and delete downloads.<query> what is download manager</query> Another novelty is the “New Tab” page - a generic page that will welcome you each time when you open a new tab, and just like a similar page in Chrome, offer the list of most commonly visited websites, as well as the ability to reopen recently closed tabs and windows. One more new feature is the possibility of turning on website tracking, in order for the browser to be able to make recommendations to the user as to other popular websites that may be of interest. This option uses your website history to generate a list of propositions that may be of interest to you, but that you’ve been unaware of (haven’t visited) thus far. “One Box” is a unified dropdown box which displays search recommendations based on your previous searches, but also the particular search engine’s recommendations. Finally, there’s the logical evolution of many browsers’ search homepage, entitled “Pinned Sites” here - you’re<query> what is website tracking in chrome</query> now able to drag & drop a particular website onto Windows 7’s taskbar, creating an icon that will enable you to run IE9 and open the desired webpage quickly and easily. Furthermore, using this feature and the integration with Windows 7, websites are now allowed to customise these links with specific commands and shortcuts applicable to the website. Security The belief that Microsoft’s browsers are insecure and that problems contained within them are found and amended on a daily basis is still widespread. Of course, all those who’ve been following and testing browser safety are familiar with the fact that this just isn’t true anymore and that IE8 redefined Internet Explorer safety standards to the point where other browsers took to some of them. IE9, just like its predecessor, separates different tabs into different processes, while pinned sites are run as entirely independent applications.<query> what is the difference between ie9 and ie9</query> This provides maximum browser stability and ensures that one tab crashing won’t affect the functionality of others. What’s more, the “sandbox” model that’s used by these processes ensures that the process can’t take over your PC even if hijacked by malicious software. Like its predecessor, IE9 is actively using the SmartScreen base for recognising malicious sites, but also adds an additional security layer, by scanning every downloaded file in search for malicious code. IE9 also has the ability to filter and shut down all ActiveX controls on various websites, activating only those that you really need. Besides the already familiar InPrivate Browsing option, habitually called “incognito mode”, after the term introduced by Google Chrome, IE9 also contains the Tracking Protection option, which provides even more detailed and secure settings concerning the information about you and your PC that will be made available to the websites you’re visiting and their partners.<query> what is ie9</query> Prev - Next >> Site Map - Navigation Home News Hardware Mobile Games Internet IT Software InsideHW Misc WebReviews Reviews CPU Motherboards Memory Graphics Cards Mobility Notebooks Multimedia Configurations Cases Cooling PSU Displays Digital Cameras Peripherals Optical Drives Storage Software Operating Systems Office Suite Tools Multimedia Internet Guides Overclocking Modding Editorials Interviews Events Columns Contact Us Contents copyright © 2007-2012 by Digital World.

Whale Introduction » Interior / Walk Around » Driving Impressions » Summary Walk Around The Audi A5 and S5 are arguably among the best looking cars on the road, appearing at once formal and sporting. On each side a strong character line arches over the front wheel and carries all the way to the tail, but apart from the bottom of the door and sides of the panoramic glass roof there's hardly a straight line to be found. Proportions are classic coupe with minimal bodywork ahead of the front wheels, a substantial rear roof pillar, moderate trunk lid and a longer tail than snout. The door windows are frameless and visual strength is added by a central pillar that hides as a dark panel behind the rear side glass. Cabriolets keep much the same proportions with their folding soft-top (which folds in 15 seconds, among the fastest in class) and really look good with the top down.<query> what is the best looking car</query> Out in the open the A5 appears larger than it really is; the Audi is half a foot shorter than Jaguar's XK, BMW's 650 or Bentley's GTC and just half a foot longer than a 911, yet it comes across at least as spacious inside as any of those. In terms of styling, the A5 is the cleanest, the S5 the most aggressive, and the A5 with S line package splits the difference. The leading edges of the car are the inner points of the lower grilles that separate the central grille section from the lights and side grilles, much like the leading points of a manta ray. On the S5 aluminum-look trim is used at the lower edge of the grille, on the outside mirrors, and at the bottom of the rear bumper between the four exhaust outlets.<query> what is the difference between audi a5 and s5</query> Bi-xenon headlamps give these cars that wild-animal-stalking-prey look. Crisp, white LED daytime running lamps run along the bottoms and outer edges of these headlamps, setting a higher standard for appearance and function; they can be turned off if you wish, automatically dim for use as parking lights, and are off on whichever side the turn signal is blinking for better vision of said signal. Some car companies could learn something from this design. Most wheels are five-spoke or a derivative, like the two-by-five propeller-blade shaped spokes on the S5 which use a fingered center cap to cover all the lug nuts. The designer of the A5 calls the car the most beautiful he has ever designed. The A5 made it onto Hagerty's Hot List, so a leading insurer of collector cars believes the A5 may become more desirable over the next 20 years.<query> what is the most beautiful car</query> Interior 2011 Audi A5 Climb into an Audi A5 and you're immediately convinced this is a driver's car, albeit a nicely finished one that you could easily use as a daily driver. The A5 and S5 offer multiple selections of leather and trim, including different types of wood, carbon fiber, aluminum or stainless steel. Every surface has a pleasant feel, regardless of the material from which it's constructed. It is modern Teutonic luxury in the vein of multiple finishes that complement each other well, with stark efficiency or warmth determined by color choices and trim components. The S5 cabin is done in mostly dark materials, including the woven headliner and sunshade. Lighter trim highlights the roof panel pull (it slides forward from the rear), gauge nacelles, vents, speaker grilles, and control knobs with piano black centers.<query> what is the interior of audi a5</query> The black lacquer also surrounds the primary control area aft of the shifter. A three-spoke leather-wrapped wheel has hand grips at all the right places and just two controls on each side spoke. However, each side has a thumbwheel that serves multiple functions by scrolling up or down or pressing to click, allowing a majority of system operations to be done without removing a hand from the wheel. Oft-used controls like cruise, signals, flash-to-pass/main beams, and wipe/wash are all on handy stalks. The wheel adjusts for reach and rake with a single manual release, giving all the advantages: Proper driving position, spacing from airbag, and instrument view. The center armrest also adjusts for height and rake, so it you can use it in cruise mode and slide it out of the way for lots of shifting on winding roads.<query> what is the steering wheel on a chevy rv</query> Front seats range from very good in the A5 to excellent in the S5, and the S line models fall in between. Any A5/S5 seat provides for hours of comfort and wiggle room while maintaining all the lateral support required to explore the car's capabilities. On the S5 the headrests are integral with the backrest and not adjustable, yet the head rest and neck protection are all in the right place and satisfactory for those well past six feet. Thigh extensions in the seat cushions let those tall drivers use more chair than just the area under their pants pockets, and there's plenty of leg room and a good dead pedal. A fast-slide switch on the front seat backrests eases access to the rear buckets which are nicely sculpted and comfortable for most up to 5-feet, 10-inches tall.<query> what is the difference between a5 and s5</query> A substantial armrest folds down over central storage trays and passengers are catered to with reading lights, two speakers per side, coat hooks, outboard storage pockets, cupholders, and a pair of vents with adjustable temperature control. To enlarge the cargo area the rear seat folds in a 50/50-split, allowing a pass-through into the passenger compartment for carrying longer items. The Cabriolet has a lightly revised rear seat but the side windows do roll down. A wind-blocker cuts buffeting in the front if you have no passengers.

Why is a “3-way” switch? A 3-way switch enables one or more light fixtures to be operated from two different locations, for example, at opposite ends of a hallway or at the top and bottom of a stairway. The term “3-way” refers to the fact that there are three terminals on a 3-way switch, instead of the two terminals found on a standard on-off switch. What is the difference between an outlet and a receptacle? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Technically, an outlet is where a light or appliance is connected to the circuit's wires. A receptacle is the device that is often called an ""outlet,"" the cords for lamps, appliances, or other electrical equipment is plugged into.<query> what is the difference between a breaker and a receptacle</query> What is the difference between a device, a fixture, and an appliance? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A fixture usually refers to a light that is permanently installed in a ceiling or a wall. An appliance refers to almost any electrically powered machine or apparatus that uses electricity. A device (e.g., switch, breaker, receptacle) is used to allow or interrupt the flow of current through the circuit to fixtures, appliances, or lamps. If some things are not working, where is the best place to begin looking for the problem? First check to see that the light or appliance in question is plugged in securely and that no bulbs are burned out. Then reset any breakers and GFCIs that may have tripped. You may need to look for an open (loose, corroded, broken) connection.<query> what is the difference between a fixture and an appliance</query> What is happening when lights or appliances will go out for a while and then come back on their own? This usually indicates a loose connection that makes contact intermittently, as when a wire is moved or pressure is applied to the connection. Loose connections can generate heat and may present a fire hazard. You can isolate the problem by moving the lamp or appliance to a different outlet to see if the problem lies with the lamp or the outlet. How can I tell if a circuit is overloaded? The most obvious indication that a circuit is overloaded is where the circuit breaker trips and then trips again after resetting it. If you are running several lights or appliances on the same circuit, first try shutting some of them off to see if that corrects the problem. If you are running several appliances on a surge strip or extension cord, check the label for the maximum number of watts that should be run on it.<query> what does it mean when a light goes out and comes back on its own</query> If the surge strip or extension cord is hot to the touch, stop using it immediately. What should I do if a circuit breaker trips when I am using a vacuum, hairdryer or other appliance? Appliances such as vacuums or hair dryers can draw a lot of power and may trip a circuit breaker. The simplest remedy is to turn off other appliances while using one of these appliances. If the problem persists, it may indicate that additional circuits should be added to handle the load. What should I do if I get a shock when touching a faucet or pipe? If you live near high-voltage power lines, those lines may create voltage in your pipes; the power company may or may not be able to help. Otherwise, the particular circuit responsible can be identified and the stray wire located. The grounding of those pipes should be checked.<query> what to do if a circuit breaker trips</query> What causes lights to flicker? Flickering lights usually indicate a poor connection in the light or contact somewhere in the circuit or in the panel. Finding the exact source of the problem-point can be difficult. It can be caused by a bad light socket or a poor electrical connection somewhere in the wires leading to the light (most likely right at the fixture). Flickering can cause the bad connection to get hot and may start a fire. If you cannot locate the cause of the flickering and it affects many or all lights, this could indicate a bad neutral connection, which can also be dangerous. Another indication of a neutral problem; as larger appliances (washing machines/dishwashers) cycle lights will get noticeably brighter or dimmer (minor changes in intensity are normal). If you suspect this problem have either the electric company or an electrician check it out.<query> what causes a light to flicker</query> What causes the lights to sometimes go dim or get extra bright? It’s not unusual for the lights to go dim or get bright when an appliance or motor goes on or off. What causes a light, switch, or breaker box to hum? Some dimmer switches will cause light fixtures to hum. At the breaker panel, the 60 cycles per second of your alternating current can set up a vibration or slight buzz or hum in some components. Fluorescent lights, transformers, and an electric water heater can also hum. All these are fairly normal, but if the hum is loud, it may mean that the component is loose or close to failing. If a circuit breaker gets wet, it can cause a buzzing sound as the moisture is boiled off. A loud buzzing at a breaker could indicate that the breaker overloading without tripping as it should.<query> what causes a light to hum</query> Should I be concerned if a switch or outlet gets hot? Yes. An outlet that is hot to the touch likely means that wires connecting to it are loose or that the outlet needs to be replaced. You should contact a licensed electrician immediately. A hot switch is usually a dimmer switch (it may or may not still be able to dim lights). If more than 600 watts of light bulbs are controlled by a single dimmer, it is probably overloaded. In that case, install a switch rated to handle more watts or replace the bulbs in the fixture with lower-wattage bulbs. Normally dimmers perform best when they control 80% of their rated load. A dimmer rated at 600 watts, means 480 watts is all the more load that dimmer should control. For example 8- 60 watt bulbs is all that should be connected to that dimmer.<query> what is the hot switch on a light switch</query> What causes a circuit breaker to get hot? It is normal for circuit breakers to be warm when current is running through them, but if one is hotter than the others, it may indicate a poor connection. If you have been running an appliance that draws a lot of current, (a space heater, for example) for an extended period, this would be normal, but the excess heat may trip the breaker. If there is a smell like burning plastic what might be happening? If you smell burning plastic from something electrical, it may indicate a poor connection that is creating heat, and melting the plastic housing of the outlet. Turn off whatever is plugged in and remove the plug. This presents a possible fire hazard and you should contact a licensed electrician immediately. Why do some light bulbs burn out more quickly than others?<query> why does my circuit breaker smell like plastic</query> There are several factors that may cause light bulbs to burn out quickly. Light bulbs that are used more often will, of course burn out faster. If the lights are left on a lot, such as an outdoor light that is left on all night, then the bulbs will have to be changed more often. Turning a bulb on and off frequently also reduces the life of the bulb. When a fixture cannot dissipate the heat of its bulbs, it takes a toll on the bulbs and on the fixture's sockets and wires. Or there may be loose connections in the wiring of a circuit. The packaging of any light bulb should have an average life expectancy printed on it. A typical light bulb will last roughly 900 hours. At 10 hours a day, that’s three months. Less expensive bulbs may be of lesser quality and not last as long.<query> how long do light bulbs last</query> If you compute the average life of your bulbs and discover it’s clearly less than the manufacturer’s rated life, this may be caused by: Over-voltage in your house. Occasionally this causes more serious problems. You can check the voltage in your home with an inexpensive multimeter available at most hardware or electronics stores. If the voltage is 125V or higher, contact your power company about it. 7 or 8 extra volts on a 120V line can dramatically reduce the life expectancy of a light bulb. If it’s a slight over-voltage, you can buy special 125V bulbs, though they may be hard to find. The life expectancy of a bulb will also be affected by the quality of power from the power company. This includes the little surges and spikes that are better known for their effect on computers. But it also includes the basic voltage level coming to the home from the utility.<query> what is the voltage of a light bulb</query> Electricity is simply a flow of electrons. Electricity is seen in nature in the form of lightning or in static electricity, such as you might experience by touching a metal doorknob after shuffling your feet on a carpeted floor. Electricity that we use in our daily lives is produced from a variety of sources, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or increasingly from wind turbines and photovoltaic solar arrays. The power is then distributed through a nationwide grid that balances production capacity with power demand. What is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage? Voltage pushes current through a resistance, using power (wattage). What is the relationship between amperes, ohms, watts, and volts? W (volts) push X amperes (current) through Y ohms (resistance), using Z watts.<query> what is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage?</query> Many homes receive more than the average 120 volts that most bulbs are designed to handle and this shortens their stated life. A good solution to this is to look for the same bulb but with a ""130v"" rating stamped on the bulb instead of ""120v"". The light output of these won’t be quite as bright, but you will spend time changing bulbs. Too high a wattage bulb in too small an enclosed fixture (such as a globe). Because the heat cannot escape, the bulb will burn too hot, shortening bulb life. Recessed lighting fixtures covered by insulation, which blocks ventilation. Heat can build up around the bulb, causing short bulb life. Vibration bulbs in use under a stairway, on or near an out of balance bathroom or ceiling fan, or near a door that gets slammed, or any activity that sends vibration through the building can shorten bulb life Shock resistant, or “rough service” bulbs are one solution for this situation. .<query> what causes bulbs to shorten life</query> back to top GFCI Outlets What is a GFCI outlet? The initials “GFCI” stand for ground-fault circuit interrupter. A GFCI (or simply “GFCI”) outlet is a safety device that prevents dangerous electric shocks by cutting power to an outlet immediately when it detects a short circuit. For example, if water from a nearby sink is splashed on a GFCI outlet, the power would be cut to the outlet before a person could be shocked or electrocuted. In the home, GFCI outlets and breakers are typically found in kitchens, bathrooms and other locations where water is present. What does the light on a GFCI outlet indicate? Some newer GFCI outlets have lights, which may indicate different things on different brands. On some brands the light indicates that the GFCI is tripped and needs to be reset.<query> what is gfci</query> On other brands, the reverse is true, and the light indicates that the outlet is live. Can a circuit fail without tripping a breaker or a GFCI? Yes. A circuit can fail if a connection at the breaker or at the circuit's neutral wire in the electrical panel comes loose or deteriorates. More often these ""opens"" involve less than the entire circuit because a connection somewhere on the circuit—at another outlet box for example—has failed. Why won't a GFCI reset? A GFCI may fail to reset because of a ground-fault occurring at another outlet that is wired in sequence with the GFCI. A single GFCI device can protect as many as three additional outlets that are wired “downstream” of the GFCI. It could be the GFCI itself has no power reaching it because of a short or an open or another GFCI that is tripped upstream from it.<query> why won't a gfci reset</query> Tripped GFCIs made after 2002 cannot be reset if power is not reaching their line terminals. If a GFCI will not reset, should it be replaced? Possibly, but it is more common for a GFCI receptacle to retrip (or to not reset) for reasons other than a bad GFCI. A new GFCI installed in the same location may not reset either. There may be a ground-fault at some ""downstream"" wire or receptacle or electrical device. Your GFCI that won't reset could have been installed incorrectly recently; since 2002 GFCI receptacles have had a feature that won't let them reset if they are hooked up wrong or if power is not on. The typical service life of a GFCI is 6-10 years. GFCI outlets should be checked regularly to make sure they are functioning properly. How can you tell when a GFCI goes bad?<query> why won't my gfci reset</query> The most common way for a GFCI device to fail is that it will continue to supply power after you push the test button. When a GFCI fails, it no longer provides protection from dangerous electric shocks. GFCI devices made after 2002 will not reset if they are not receiving power. GFCI devices made before 2002, whose reset stays in, can fail to operate for the same reason — not receiving power. If a GFCI will not reset and/or retrips immediately after resetting, it may indicate a fault condition “downstream” from the GFCI, rather than a malfunction of the GFCI. What is the difference between a surge arrester and a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS)? These terms are often used interchangeably and rather loosely. However, the two terms have different meanings as defined by the National Electrical Code® (NEC®) (www.nfpa.org), their UL listing, and applicable IEEE/ANSI standards.<query> what is the difference between a surge arrester and a tvss</query> A secondary arrester refers to a surge protective device (SPD) that is listed for use ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility (the service entrance panel), while a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS) is only listed to be used after this primary disconnect. An SPD listed under UL1449 as a TVSS device must not be connected ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility. However, secondary surge arresters can be connected either upstream or downstream of the main disconnect back to top Dimmers What is the function of a dimmer? A dimmer provides the flexibility to vary the amount of light in a room depending on the size of the space, the time of day, and the task or activity being performed. Dimmers may be used almost anywhere: bathrooms, bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, game rooms, hallways, kitchens, living rooms, media rooms, or office or commercial spaces.<query> what is the purpose of a dimmer</query> What makes the lights dim? An electrical component in the dimmer, called a “triac” turns the light on and off very rapidly—120 times per second. But with a dimmer, the human eye perceives a steady level of dimmed light. The longer the light is “on” versus “off,” the brighter the light appears. Conversely, when the light is “off” more than “on,” the lights are dimmer. If the lights are being turned on and off, won’t the lights seem to be flickering? No. No matter how bright or how dim, the light level is constant and smooth. The human eye sees things after they go away. An example of this is in movies where the film is projected on the screen many times a second. Doesn’t turning the lights on and off so quickly decrease bulb life?<query> why do lights flicker</query> No. Switching the bulb does not decrease bulb life. Heat decreases bulb life, and by reducing heat, bulb life is increased. Do dimmers save electricity and/or increase lamp life? Yes. The longer the triac is off, the lower the light output, and the greater the energy savings. Dimmers can save electricity, save money and help increase the life of the lamps (light bulbs) being controlled. Dimmers can increase the life of incandescent bulbs and halogen bulbs (which are a type of incandescent bulb.) The table below shows the energy savings and increase in life of the lamp (light bulb) that can be achieved with dimmers. Percentage dimmed Energy savings Lamp life increase 10% 10% 2x 25% 20% 4x 50% 40% 20x 75% 60% >20x What light sources can be controlled by dimmers?<query> do dimmers save electricity</query> Most standard dimmers can control standard incandescent lamps that use 120 volts. Other dimmers can control low voltage xenon or halogen light sources that use 12 or 24 volts. Low voltage lighting systems use either an electronic or a magnetic transformer and there are dimmers specifically designed for each type of transformer. If the wrong type of dimmer is used, it will cause the low voltage light fixtures to flicker. Can one dimmer control both a line voltage light fixture AND a low voltage lighting system? If the low voltage lighting system uses an electronic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Likewise, if the low voltage lighting system uses a magnetic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Does dimming affect halogen bulb life? Yes. Dimming increases incandescent lamp life.<query> what type of dimmer is used for low voltage lighting</query> Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament. Lutron’s pilot test data suggests the halogen lamps will have an expected lamp life similar to other incandescent lamps when dimmed. As an example, one type of halogen lamp with a rated life of 2,000 hours dimmed to 80 V has a life extension of at least five times. Can neon/cold cathode lamps be dimmed? Yes. Neon/cold cathode lamps can be dimmed using the proper equipment. Lutron Nova low voltage dimmers and GRAFIC Eye controls are UL listed for neon/cold cathode loads. back to top Dimming CFLs and LEDs Dimming saves energy while setting the right light level to improve mood and ambiance. Screw-in compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and screw-in light emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) are a great energy-saving alternative to incandescent or halogen light sources; however, dimming them may be difficult.<query> can halogen lamps be dimmed</query> Amps times ohms = volts. Amps times volts = watts. How do I know if the wiring in my home is safe? If the wiring in your home was 1) installed by a professional electrician, 2) inspected and approved by your local electrical inspector, and 3) has not been modified or damaged, then your wiring should be safe. But, if for any reason you suspect that some of the wiring in your home is not safe, contact a professional electrician to identify and correct the problem. back to top Circuits and Circuit Breakers What is a circuit? A circuit is the actual or intended path of current between points of differing voltage. In the case of a conventional household 120 volt circuit, the path runs from the ""hot"" wire from the circuit breaker in the electrical panel, to an outlet or fixture and through a device or appliance that is using the electricity, then back to the breaker in the panel via a ""neutral"" wire connected to the grounded neutral bar in the panel.<query> what is the difference between volts and amps</query> Lutron’s new CFLâ€¢LED (Câ€¢Lâ„¢) Dimmers with HEDâ„¢ Technology help alleviate your CFL and LED dimming challenges. Challenges of dimming CFLs and LEDs with standard dimmers Energy-saving CFLs have been in the marketplace for many years but a broad range of dimmable bulbs has only recently become available. LEDs are even newer to the market and dimmable versions are also only recently available. These dimmable bulbs, especially CFLs, have historically presented problems when used on standard incandescent dimmers. Common problems include: Reduced dimming range: Incandescent/halogen bulbs will typically dim lower than CFL or LED bulbs. Most dimmable CFLs will dim down to 10% to 30% measured light output. Early versions of dimmable LEDs on the market have the ability to dim lower than CFLs and can reach levels as low as 5% to 15% measured light.<query> what is the difference between cfl and led</query> The actual dimming range is dictated by the bulb’s circuitry. Lights dropping out: As CFL or LED bulbs are dimmed, they will sometimes turn off before the slider reaches the bottom. Referred to as “drop out,” this makes it extremely difficult to set the dimmer at the right level without bulbs turning off. Lights not turning on: After being dimmed to a low light level and switched off, sometimes CFL or LED bulbs will not turn on until the dimmer’s slider is moved up. This is referred to as “pop-on,” which is especially challenging in 3-way situations where lights can be turned on/off from different locations, not just using the dimmer. Lights turning off unexpectedly: Dimmable CFL and LED bulbs can be influenced by line voltage fluctuations. As your incandescent bulbs will sometimes dim or flicker when a device such as air-conditioning or a hair dryer is used, a dimmed CFL or LED can actually turn off or flicker excessively in those situations.<query> why do cfl bulbs turn off</query> Note: Actual performance of any CFL or LED will vary from bulb type to bulb type and among different manufacturers. It is important to note that only bulbs that have been designed as dimmable should be used on a dimmer. To find out if your bulb is dimmable, please check the package, the bulb itself, or call the bulb manufacturer directly. Why do dimmers get warm, and is this safe? During normal operation, solid-state dimmers generate heat. A solid state dimmer is roughly 98% efficient—2% of the power is dissipated as heat, which causes the dimmer to feel warm to the touch. The closer a dimmer is run to full output and the higher the load (watts) on the dimmer, the warmer it will feel. This is perfectly normal and safe. Lutron dimmers are designed to the strictest UL safety standard, and can handle their full rated load (a 600 W dimmer can handle a full 600 W of power without overheating.<query> why do dimmer get warm</query> (Dimmers that are ganged together in a common wallbox may need to be derated.) What is “common neutral interaction”? Common neutral interaction occurs between at least two dimmers that share the same neutral wire. When solid-state dimmers are operating, voltage spikes occur and are transmitted onto the neutral wire. Normally this is of little concern. When the neutral wire is common (to 2 or more phases of a 3-phase, 4-wire system) the voltage spikes may feed back to the dimmers. The common neutral wire can cause interaction between the dimmers that are on different phases. The following are symptoms of common neutral interaction: Lights flicker at certain dimmer settings Lights flash to full output at certain dimmer settings Light level of a dimmer on 1 phase inadvertently changes when a dimmer on another phase is adjusted.<query> what is common neutral interaction</query> Lutron recommends the following methods to avoid common neutral interaction: Run separate neutral wires for each dimming circuit, from each dimmer’s load to the distribution panel Install a lamp debuzzing coil What is radio frequency interference (RFI)? RFI is a buzzing noise that may occur in some audio and radio equipment when solid state dimmers are used nearby. Although every Lutron dimmer contains a filter to suppress RFI, additional filtering may be required in some applications. Typical examples of RFI sensitive equipment are AM radios, stereo sound systems, broadcasting equipment, intercom systems, public address systems, and wireless telephones. back to top LED Lights What is an LED light? LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. A diode is a semiconductor that allows current to flow in only one direction. Semiconductor diodes are a junction of two materials, one with a positive and the other with a negative charge.<query> what is rfi</query> When this PN junction is applied with a forward voltage, electrons and holes are brought together releasing light energy. Hence: Light Emitting Diode. What is the difference between an incandescent bulb and an LED bulb? Incandescent bulbs creates light when current is run through a filament. Resistance in the filament generates heat, which causes it to glow and produces light. LEDs create light when power is applied to semiconductors (usually gallium, arsenic and phosphorous), which are stimulated by the movement of electrons, creating visible light. How does the brightness of LED lighting compare to incandescent lighting? LED light bulbs are much brighter than incandescent or halogen bulbs of the same wattage, but LED bulbs are not available in very high wattages. Thus, when replacing incandescent or halogen lamps with LED lamps, more LED lamps are often needed.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and led light bulbs</query> For example, replacing one 100-watt incandescent bulb may require two 5-watt or 6-watt LED bulbs. Nevertheless, LED lights can save up to 85% of the electricity used by a traditional incandescent bulb. How bright are LED light bulbs? The brightest LED bulbs produce light comparable to a 120-watt incandescent bulb while only consuming the electricity of a 25 watt incandescent bulb. LED bulbs available for standard fixtures vary in brightness from less than 50 lumens up to about 1200 lumens. The brightest LED bulbs for standard fixtures are floodlights and spotlights. The brightest LED bulbs with approximately the same size and shape as ordinary incandescent bulbs produce up to 600 lumens. Are bulbs with more LEDs brighter than bulbs with less? Different types of LEDs vary greatly in size and light output and the number of LEDs does not determine brightness.<query> what is the brightest led light bulb</query> The most accurate indicators of the brightness of LED bulbs are the measured lumens or lux. Lumens measure the total amount of light output from a bulb. Lux measures how bright the light is on a surface at a specified distance. How efficient are LED bulbs compared to incandescent bulbs? Newer LED light bulbs are more than five times as efficient as comparable incandescent bulbs. In addition, because LED bulbs direct a larger percentage of light where it is needed, in some applications they are as much as ten times as effective as incandescent bulbs, reducing energy use by 90%. Why do LEDs use such little power? LEDs do not use a filament where a conductor is heated and light is created. Filament based lighting consumes more power than the light produced. LEDs produce very little heat and do not use filaments, making them far more efficient in consumption and output.<query> how efficient are led lights</query> In addition, incandescent bulbs project light in every direction (omni directional) as opposed to LED lights which project light in specified directions (such as 20, 50 and 120 degrees) due to their package design and layout. What is the useful life of LED bulbs? High quality, white LED bulbs typically last for 50,000 hours. By contrast, most traditional incandescent bulbs have a useful life of 1,000 hours and halogen bulbs typically last about 3,000 hours. And an average compact fluorescent bulb typically lasts for 10,000 hours. In an average home, if an LED bulb burned from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. 365 days a year, it would last more than 25 years. But unlike other types of lights, LED bulbs slowly decrease in brightness over time, rather than burning out suddenly. Near the end of its service life, an LED bulb will typically put out only 70% of its original light.<query> how long do led lights last</query> Higher quality LED lights have design features that enable them to burn brighter, longer. Can LED lights be used with a dimmer? LED lights that are dimmable indicate on the package or website. Make sure you check with the manufacturer of the LED for dimmer compatibility. What is an LED driver? An LED driver is a self-contained power supply that has outputs matched to the electrical characteristics of the LED or array of LEDs. Drivers should be current-regulated (deliver a consistent current over a range of load voltages). Dimmable LED drivers may also offer dimming by means of pulse width modulation (PWM) circuits. Drivers may have more than one channel for separate control of different LEDs or arrays. Are outdoor LEDs affected by extreme weather conditions? LED lights are designed to function in temperatures from -40F to 180F, exceeding the conditions where most incandescent and florescent bulbs will fail.<query> what is led driver</query> A typical home has many circuits, with each individual circuit supplying power to a number of outlets or fixtures. A single room may receive power from two or more circuits. Technically, each loop that current makes (through a single light and its switch, for example) is a circuit, but the most common meaning is the ""branch circuit"", that is, everything fed (or interrupted) by a given breaker or fuse. Do circuit breakers ever go bad or wear out? Yes, but not very often. When a breaker will not reset, the cause may be a short that is retripping it immediately or you may not be resetting it properly. Circuit breakers have toggle switches with three positions: on, off, and tripped. When the breaker is tripped, you must move the toggle switch all the way to the off position before moving it to the on position.<query> what is the difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker</query> In addition, while florescent bulbs need to warm up to achieve full brightness in cold weather, there is no warm up time needed for LEDs. Is it true that LED lights do not attract insects? Generally, yes. Most insects cannot see the spectrum of light produced by LEDs. Are LED diodes inherently directional? LED diodes are not inherently directional. One way to boost light intensity is to focus the beam more tightly. This is accomplished with a lens that directs light. MR and PAR series LEDs have a beam angle of 15 to 60 degrees. This does not change the light output, only the direction of the light. Do LEDs produce heat? LEDs ordinarily produce only a fraction of the heat produced by incandescent bulbs. If LEDs are hot to the touch, they are poorly designed being overpowered due to improper circuitry.<query> do led lights attract insects</query> What does CRI stand for? The color rendering index (CRI) (sometimes called color rendition index), is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully compared to a natural light source. Why are LEDs different colors? The color of an LED is a function of the material used to make the junction. There are two main materials used in visible light LED junctions: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN): used to make up the blue, white, true green, and UV types Aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP or AlInGaP): used to make the red, yellow, and orange types Are LEDs available in “warm” and “cool” light output, like traditional lights? How do you make a white LED? Yes. LED lights can be “tuned” to look warm or cool by adjusting the amounts of colors in the mix or by using a blue LED with a phosphor coating.<query> what is the color of led</query> The coating emits a yellow light when the blue light from the LED shines on it. The mix of the yellow light with the blue light forms a white light. Inefficiency in the phosphor conversion is one reason that a white LED is less efficient overall than a colored LED. Some of the light energy is lost in the conversion to yellow. What is the difference between an LED floodlight and a spotlight? LED spotlights put out a narrower beam of light than a floodlight, typically less than 45 degrees wide. LED floodlights put out a wider beam of light, up to 120 degrees A spotlight is more suited to illuminating objects and a floodlight is more suited to illuminating areas. back to top Dark Sky Regulated Lights What are Dark Sky Regulated Lights? Growing populations have increased the need for lighting ten-fold in the past 25 years.<query> what is the difference between a led floodlight and led spotlight</query> “Dark sky” regulations are intended to reduce “light pollution” caused by the over-lighting of various places in the city such as streets, parking lots, and decorative lighting. What is light pollution and why is it important? Light pollution indicates wasted energy. Light pollution blocks the view of stars and other celestial bodies. Light pollution is not limited to big cities, and is a concern beyond astronomers and dark sky enthusiasts. You experience light pollution when you can’t sleep at night because of a neighbor’s outdoor light, when a driver’s headlights are too intense for your dark-adjusted eyes and the glare becomes blinding, and can also have an adverse effect on wildlife. Dark sky regulated lights cut glare and prevent light trespass that will reduce sky glow and thus waste less energy. Glare, light trespass and sky glow are those components of wasted for outdoor lighting.<query> why is it important to have a dark sky</query> What is glare? Glare affects motorists at night when the high-beam lights of an oncoming car makes it difficult to see. Resolve this by aiming lights down or using a visor to shield the light from people’s eyes. What is light trespass? Light trespass refers to bright light that intrudes on neighboring property. An example would be light from a commercial parking lot that shines into a window or back yard, limiting the use of the yard in the evening. Dark sky regulations require the lights to be aimed down or shielded so the light is limited to a specific spot, or motion sensors. This also affects wildlife. What is sky glow? People living in large cities rarely see the dark night sky because of sky glow. Sky glow can adversely affect wildlife and limit the enjoyment of the night sky.<query> what is the definition of light trespass</query> Sky glow, virtually always indicates wasted energy. Properly installed outdoor lighting will prevent this. (For more information on dark sky regulations, visit www.darksky.org). What is being done to address the problem? Many neighborhood associations and community leaders are trying to preserve our natural dark skies, especially in areas near wildlife and state parks. Many communities are passing legislation to regulate the use and design of outdoor lighting. Such lighting equipment is often referred to as Dark Sky Compliant, Cut-off Lighting, Friendly Lighting or Good Neighbor Lighting, Dark Sky Regulated. These names all refer to fixtures that are designed to reduce upward light reflection, glare, trespassing light, inefficient energy use and urban sky glow. The lighting industry has responded by creating light fixtures that consumers can easily install with little modification to their existing systems.<query> what is the purpose of the light fixture</query> This response has allowed dark sky compliance to be more accessible to the general public. Simple technologies and modifications to outdoor fixtures like motion-sensor activated flood lights, timers; hoods and reflectors even using focused lights in lower wattages can help. back to top Energy Star What is Energy Star? Energy Star is a government program dedicated to awareness and the promotion of energy efficient products for both consumers and manufacturers. The Energy Star program is administered jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Energy Star identifies and recommends products with the highest industry standards of quality and low-energy consumption. Products with the Energy Star label use less energy and therefore save the user money on electricity. For example, on average, fluorescent lights use only 2/3 as much energy as their incandescent counterparts, and some last up to 10 times longer.<query> what is energy star</query> The extra accost of compact fluorescent bulbs will be exceeded in cost savings over the life of the bulb. In addition, because Energy Star products use less energy, they also help reduce air pollution from power generators. (For more information visit:www.energystar.gov.) Doesn’t energy efficient equal ugly, industrial and bulky? No. More efficient lighting does not mean less light or less attractive lighting. New lighting technology provides both equal illumination and the choice of “warm” or “cool” light available in traditional lighting. Some early models of efficient lights featured large, bulky bulbs and humming ballasts, but these problems are all in the past. Energy efficient lighting is now available in almost any style and for any application, and new technologies such as LED lights are becoming more common and more affordable every day.<query> why are energy efficient bulbs used</query> Is energy efficient lighting as safe as traditional lighting? Yes. In addition, fluorescent and LED lights are much cooler to the touch than regular halogen and incandescent lights and thus are less of a fire hazard. What else can I do to be more energy efficient? Research energy efficient solutions available in your community. Many communities now issue rebates or other incentive including free upgrades to switch over to more energy efficient fixtures. Many local environmental agencies provide consumer tips on saving energy and money. Small modifications such as timers, motion-sensors, photo-cells as well as solar energy can help the environment. Simply shutting off a light when you leave the room makes a great difference if a million people do it. Especially in the summer and winter months, there are high demands on electricity. Small things like installing a ceiling fan and reversing the fan’s direction during the winter months to distribute trapped heat from the ceiling.<query> what is the best way to conserve energy</query> In the summer, cool only those areas of the house that are actually in use. back to top Smoke Alarms Why should my home have smoke alarms? In the event of a fire, properly installed and maintained smoke alarms provide an early warning so people can escape in time. Smoke alarms are one of the most effective safety devices you can buy and install to protect yourself, your family and your home. What types of smoke alarms are available? There are many different brands of smoke alarms on the market but they fall under two basic types: ionization and photoelectric. Ionization alarms sound more quickly when a flaming, fast moving fire occurs. Photoelectric smoke alarms are better at sensing smoldering smoky fires. There are also combination smoke alarms, called dual sensor smoke alarms, that combine ionization and photoelectric into one unit.<query> what type of alarms are there</query> If the breaker will not reset after repeated attempts, it is best to call a professional electrician. How much area can be served by one circuit? How many outlets can be wired on one GFCI? A 15-amp circuit should not serve over more than 600 square feet of a home. A 20-amp circuit should not serve more than 800 square feet. Some GFCI manufacturers recommend no more than eight outlets downstream. A lengthy series of GFCI loads can trip the GFCI. If that is suspected, each such load outlet could be given its own GFCI receptacle, connected to protect only itself. What is the difference between hot, neutral, and ground wires? Typical electrical cable includes a minimum of three wires: hot, neutral, and ground. The “hot” wire, which is usually black in color, carries current from the power source, such as a home’s electrical panel, to a switch, outlet or fixture.<query> how many outlets can be on a gfci</query> Because both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms are better at detecting distinctly different yet potentially fatal fires, the U.S. Fire Administration recommends the installation of both ionization and photoelectric or dual sensor smoke alarms. In addition to alarms that provide an audible warning, there are alarms people with hearing disabilities. These alarms may use strobe lights that flash and/or vibrate to alert those who are unable to hear standard smoke alarms when they sound. Where should smoke alarms be placed? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Since smoke and many deadly gases rise, smoke alarms are usually installed on the ceiling or high on a wall close to the ceiling. Smoke alarms should be installed on every level of the home, including the basement. For extra safety, install smoke alarms both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Are smoke alarms hard to install?<query> where should smoke alarms be placed</query> If your smoke alarms are hard wired, that is, wired into the home’s electrical system, you will need to have a qualified electrician do the initial installation or install replacements. Battery-powered smoke alarms can usually be installed with simple hand tools. Some models can even be installed with adhesives. For all smoke alarm installations, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation. In some localities, fire departments will help install a smoke alarm in your home for you. Call your local fire department (on a non-emergency telephone number) if you have questions about installing a smoke alarm. How do I keep my smoke alarm working? In standard-type battery powered smoke alarms, It’s important to test every smoke alarm monthly and replace the batteries with new ones at least once a year.<query> how to install a smoke alarm</query> The whole unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. Helpful tip: Choose a day that is easy to remember, such as a holiday or birthday and replace the batteries each year on that day. Most smoke alarms make a “chirping” sound to signal that the batteries need to be replaced. Smoke alarms powered by long-lasting batteries are designed to replace the entire unit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Hard wired smoke alarms may or may not have battery backup. For hard-wired, battery back-up smoke alarms, just as with a battery-only model, the batteries should be checked monthly, and replaced at least once per year. The entire unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. How long do smoke alarms last? Most alarms installed today have a life span of about 8-10 years.<query> how often should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> After this time, the entire unit should be replaced. It is a good idea to write the date of purchase with a marker on the inside of your alarm so you will know when to replace it. Some smoke alarms have the date of manufacture printed on a label inside the unit. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for replacement. What if the alarm goes off while I’m cooking? Do not disable the smoke alarm if it goes off because of cooking or other non-fire causes. Instead, fan the air near the smoke alarm, leaving the batteries in place. If this happens often, the alarm may need to be moved to a new location. Some of the newer models have a “hush” button that silences nuisance alarms. Also consider a photoelectric smoke detector for this area. The U.S. Fire Administration recommends the following fire safety and prevention practices.<query> when should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> Plan and practice escape plans several times a year and designate a safe meeting place. Never change your meeting place. Make sure your whole family knows when and how to call emergency telephone numbers from outside the house or neighbors. Install a fire extinguisher on each floor of the house and learn how to use it. Install carbon monoxide detectors. If you are building a new home or planning a major remodel, consider installing residential fire sprinklers. Contact your local fire department on a non-emergency phone number is you need help or have questions about fire safety in your home. back to top Carbon Monoxide What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, invisible gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels such as natural gas, propane, wood, charcoal, gasoline, kerosene, and oil.<query> what is the difference between carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide</query> In the home, carbon monoxide can be formed from the incomplete combustion from any flame-fueled (i.e., not electric) device, including ranges, ovens, clothes dryers, furnaces, fireplaces, grills, space heaters, and water heaters. Furnaces and water heaters may be sources of carbon monoxide, but if they are vented properly the carbon monoxide will escape to the outside. Open flames, such as from ovens or ranges, are the most common source of carbon monoxide. Vehicles are the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning. Running a car in a closed garage—especially an attached garage—can be extremely dangerous. If you are doing mechanical work on a car in a garage, leave the overhead door open or attach an air hose to vent the exhaust to the outside. How do carbon monoxide detectors work? Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time.<query> what is the most common source of carbon monoxide</query> Carbon monoxide can harm you if you are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide in a short period of time, or to lower levels of carbon monoxide over a long period of time. Carbon monoxide detectors require a continuous power supply, so if the power cuts off then the alarm becomes ineffective. Models are available that offer back-up battery power. Why is carbon monoxide dangerous? When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it interferes with the oxygen transport and gas exchange abilities of red blood cells. Low levels of carbon monoxide poisoning cause symptoms similar to those of the flu or a cold, including shortness of breath on mild exertion, headaches and nausea. Higher levels of poisoning lead to dizziness, mental confusion, severe headaches, nausea, and fainting on mild exertion. Ultimately, carbon monoxide poisoning can result in unconsciousness, permanent brain damage and death.<query> why is carbon monoxide dangerous</query> Carbon monoxide detectors are set to sound an alarm before the exposure to carbon monoxide would present a healthy adult. Babies, children, pregnant women, people with circulatory or respiratory ailments, and the elderly are more sensitive to carbon monoxide than healthy adults. Where should I place a carbon monoxide detector? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Because carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air and also because it may be found with warm, rising air, detectors should be placed on a wall at least five feet above the floor or on the ceiling. Do not place the detector near a fireplace or flame-producing appliance, such as a gas stove. A carbon monoxide detector should be installed on each floor of the house, especially near sleeping areas. What do I do if the alarm sounds? The alarm is designed to go off before you experience symptoms.<query> where should carbon monoxide detectors be placed</query> Silence the alarm, get all members of the household to fresh air, and if anyone is experiencing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, call 911. If no one has symptoms, ventilate the building, identify and remedy the source of the carbon monoxide before returning inside and have appliances or chimneys checked by a professional. How often should a carbon monoxide detector be replaced? The average life span of many carbon monoxide detectors is about two years. Be aware that the “test” feature on many detectors checks the functioning of the alarm but not the ability of the detector to detect carbon monoxide. Some detectors last longer than others, indicate when they need to be replaced, and have power supply backups. When purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, consider not only the number and type of possible carbon monoxide sources, but also the construction of the building.<query> how often should carbon monoxide detectors be replaced</query> Newer buildings may have more airtight construction and may be better insulated, which makes it easier for carbon monoxide to accumulate. back to top Attic Fans How do I calculate the size fan I need for an attic? Measure the square footage of your attic (length X width) and multiply that figure by 0.7. This will give you the minimum CFM (cubic feet per minute—the measure of air volume moved by the fan) rating required for your attic. Add 15 percent for dark covered roofs. Choose a fan with a CFM rating appropriate for your attic size to ensure adequate ventilation. How much free area air intake is needed for an attic fan to work properly? Divide the CFM required by 300 and then multiply the result by 144 (one square foot, in inches) to give you the square inches of free air area required.<query> how to calculate attic fan size</query> The neutral wire, which is usually white in color, carries current back to the electrical panel. (Recall that electricity needs to flow in a circular path.) The ground wire, which is usually bare of insulation, carries no current at all under normal circumstances. The ground wire is there for safety. It provides an alternative route for current and allows the current to be discharged into the ground in case there is a short circuit. Why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester? When a neutral wire is not continuous back to the panel as it should be, the current of the hot wire goes through anything that is ready to run (but won't) and shows up on the normally-neutral wire. What is the difference between an open, an overload, a short, and a ground-fault?<query> why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester?</query> How do I calculate the existing free air in my attic? If you have eave vents or gable vents, multiply the length by width of each vent to get the square inches, (if the opening is covered with a screen, divide by 2) The net free area may be stamped on the frame of the vent. Add up all the totals from all of the vents to get your total existing free air area. If there is not enough free air area in the attic, additional vents should be added to ensure that the attic fan is working at optimal efficiency. Do attic exhaust fans come with a thermostat? Yes. All attic exhaust fans are equipped with a thermostat. What temperature should the thermostat of an attic fan/ventilator be set on? Attic fan thermostats are usually set at about 110 degrees F., depending on the climate.<query> how to calculate free air in attic</query> If the fan seems to be running too much, raise the thermostat setting by 10 degrees. Can the dome of an attic ventilator be painted? If so, what kind of paint should be used? Yes. The dome may be painted with any latex-based exterior house paint. Can a variable speed control switch be used with an attic exhaust fan? The Broan model 72 variable speed control can be used with the Broan model 350, 353, 355, and 350 attic fans. (The model #356 cannot be used with a variable speed control.) Can a gable exhaust fan be installed on a roof? No. Gable fans are designed to be installed only on vertical locations. Do roof fans have bird guards installed? Yes. Bird screens are incorporated into the individual roof exhaust fans.<query> what kind of paint to use on an attic fan</query> Can a roof fan be installed on a vertical surface? No. Roof exhaust fans are designed to be installed on horizontal or sloping surfaces. Broan-NuTone gable fans are designed for vertical installations. Can an attic exhaust fan be installed on a flat roof? Yes. Note that a waterproof curb will need to be built so that the housing is higher and snow and water levels would not affect product performance. Can I install a dehumidistat to the attic ventilator? Yes. Use model DH100W by Broan. What is a “sone,” and how is it measured? A sone is a unit of measure for sound that refers to a comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the listening environment. One sone is the equivalent of a quiet refrigerator. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is ""sensed,"" including factors such as pitch and frequency.<query> what is sone</query> For example, the sound of a car equipped with speakers that produce very low bass notes can be extremely disagreeable more because of the vibration, than because of the actual volume of the music. back to top Exhaust Fans What is continuous ventilation? Continuous ventilation provides today’s tightly constructed homes with a relatively constant and controlled level of ventilation. Broan QT Series ventilators are very quiet and efficient and are ideally suited for these applications. Can Broan fans be mounted directly above a tub or shower? Most Broan fans are rated for use over a shower or bathtub when used with a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter). Can a ceiling fan be surrounded by insulation? Yes. Broan bath fans are designed to provide adequate cooling for motors and lighting, as well as products with integral heaters. Will Broan fans work in wall-mount applications?<query> what is broan ventilation</query> Some Broan bath and utility fans may be wall mounted. See the spec matrix for specific models. Can a ceiling fan or wall-mount utility fan serve as a kitchen range hood? No. Range hoods are specifically designed to handle grease and high temperature environments. Ventilation provided by NuTone fans is only a supplement for odor and moisture removal in the kitchen. What is ""static pressure""? Static pressure is a measure of resistance to airflow as it is pushed through ductwork. Static pressure reduces the effectiveness of the fan. Static pressure increases with the length and the number of turns in the ductwork. Learn more on the Home Ventilation Institute web site www.hvi.org. How long should a bath fan run after a shower is used? The Home Ventilation Institute recommends that a fan should run for 20 minutes to clear humidity adequately and to minimize moisture and condensation in the fan body and ducting.<query> what is the static pressure of a bathroom fan</query> Is there a timer available that will turn off a fan automatically after 20 minutes? Broan has sensing fans that detect the humidity rise caused by a shower and turn on automatically. When moisture has cleared it turns off. Some wall controls also give you the option of humidity sensing or timer control. What are the timer features? Delay-off timers automatically shut your fan off after a specified time interval. This is a useful feature in high traffic bathrooms where you may wish to let the fan run to clear moisture adequately. A timer counts the minutes of fan operation selected by the user. Where should the bathroom exhaust fan be located? Exhaust fans should be located in or near the shower or tub, and in any enclosed room with a toilet. Keep exhaust points opposite the supply air source to ensure that the fresh air is drawn through the room.<query> where should bathroom exhaust fan be located</query> Bathroom doors should not be sealed too tightly at the bottom in order to allow replacement air to enter the room when the door is closed. Where is the exhaust outlet on a ventilation fan? The exhaust outlet is the point where air is discharged through the body of the fan housing into the ductwork. During installation, the fan should be oriented with the exhaust outlet pointing toward the exit vent on the roof or wall to minimize turns in ductwork that impede airflow. Why do windows and mirrors fog up even when the fan is running? If windows and mirrors are cold, condensation can still form on these surfaces. If a bathroom is sealed tightly, replacement air may not be entering the room fast enough to displace the moist air. Fan placement can also be a factor. Fans should be located far enough from the source of replacement air to ensure the moist air is drawn out first.<query> why do bathroom fans fog up</query> Too many twists and turns in the ducting will significantly reduce the ability of the blower to remove moist air. Make sure that ductwork is as short and straight as possible, with gradual turns rather than tight corners where necessary. Why is water dripping from the grille of the fan? Dripping water can be caused by either condensation (usually due to cold ductwork or improper duct installation), or a problem with the seal on a wall or roof vent. Insulated ductwork can help solve condensation problems, and running the fan longer will ensure that moisture is completely removed from the duct. If possible, ductwork should slope down toward a wall vent to direct condensation out of the exterior vent opening rather than back into the fan housing. Can I install a heater directly over the bathtub or in a shower? No.<query> why does my shower fan drip water</query> Heaters are not UL listed (Underwriter's Laboratory) for installation over bathtubs or in a shower. Can I use an inline or multi-port fan in one large bathroom? Yes, this works the best for large rooms because you can install the ports over the areas where the ventilation is needed the most (source control). The size of the multi-port would be determined by the size of the room. Does a duct-free bath fan expel air? No. A duct-free fan only circulates the air in the room. It is not a ventilating device and does not remove air from the room. What type of exhaust fan is recommended for indoor sauna or hot tub areas? A high-CFM rated device is normally recommended for this type of application. Can I use a smaller diameter duct than what the fan is designed for?<query> can a bathtub fan be used over a shower</query> This is not recommended. Undersized ductwork will cause the fan to run harder, greatly reducing the CFM performance of the fan and create excess noise. Can larger diameter ducting be used with my bath fan? Yes, larger diameters ducting will improve the performance of your fan. What type of duct is recommended, rigid or flexible? Rigid ductwork is recommended, where possible. Rigid ductwork has less resistance to air flow and allows the fan to operate much more efficiently. If flexible ducting is used, be sure the duct is as straight as possible. Can a bathroom fan be vented into an attic instead of out the roof or wall? Never direct exhaust air into spaces within walls, ceilings, attics, crawl spaces or garages. The humidity may damage the structure and insulation. Can I use a fan in a steam shower?<query> what type of ductwork is used for bathroom fan</query> An open is when a circuit's path is disrupted. An overload is when current on a circuit is excessive. A short is when current takes an unintended path to ground (usually with very little resistance). A ground-fault is when such a short does not use the neutral as its path to ground. What is an open ground? An open neutral? Reverse polarity, etc.? Measured at an outlet's receptacle, the path (wire continuity) to the ground point in the panel can be disrupted or missing for the ground wire (open ground) or for the neutral (open neutral). When the path between the outlet and its circuit breaker is disrupted, this is an “open hot.” Reverse polarity (hot and neutral reversed) means neutral wires are connected to the side of the receptacle that is supposed to be for the hot, and vice versa.<query> what is an open ground</query> No. Since these are normally sealed chambers, a vacuum will be created. Can more than one bath fan be vented out of a single roof or wall cap? Usually not. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended ventilation requirements. back to top Ceiling Fans How high should ceiling fans be mounted from the floor? Typically want to install them 8 to 9 feet off the ground Ceiling Height 9’ 10’ 11’ 12’ 13’ 15’ Down rod Length 12” 18” 24” 36” 48” 72” back to top NuTone Central Vacuum What size power unit should I use? Power units are designed for different applications and for varying square footage requirements of residences. For greatest efficiency, place the power unit as low as possible in the system. How many inlets may be installed in a system?<query> how high should ceiling fans be mounted</query> It is recommended to keep the number of inlets to the minimum needed for convenient use. But you may install as many as you require, assuming all are in proper working condition with tight seals and gaskets. What inlets should be used? Depending on the application and the power unit model will dictate which inlets are utilized for the installation. Things to consider are styling and color. The Advantage Series offers a status indicating feature and Broan-NuTone also offers a direct connect electrified inlet. Where should I locate my wall inlet valves? If you are using one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses the wall valve inlets should be located within six feet of a household power receptacle. We suggest that you take a 25 foot length of cord or a measuring tape set to 25 feet then walk though your home and locate your wall inlets so that they cover all the areas you wish to vacuum.<query> where are the inlet valves located</query> Are Broan-NuTone Vacuum components compatible with other makes? Some Broan-NuTone's components may be compatible with other makes. Call Broan-NuTone Technical Support for verification before you buy any component. What are “air watts”? “Air watts” refers to a combination of air flow and vacuum water lift created by the power unit. The greater the air watts, the greater the cleaning ability of the system. Is it necessary to exhaust the power unit to the outside? For the best indoor air quality, Broan-NuTone recommends venting the exhaust to the outside. This is not mandatory, but is recommended for a complete installation. One advantage of a central vacuum system is its ability to vacuum up all items and microscopic particles that may not be captured by the primary filter (bag).<query> what is the difference between a vacuum and a central vacuum</query> The remaining particles will then be vented to outside through the exhaust duct. Can regular PVC plumbing be used for central vacuum tubing? No. Broan-NuTone uses special thin wall tubing that must be used to ensure proper fit of inlets, hoses and other components, and for proper operation of the system. What is cyclonic action? Cyclonic action is a special feature that forces dust and debris to the bottom of the power unit's canister, allowing the power unit to operate at peak effectiveness. What is the difference between Turbo powered vacuum cleaning heads and electric powered cleaning heads? Turbo powered heads use some of the power unit's suction to operate the cleaning head. The electric cleaning heads use all of the power unit's suction for cleaning. In order to use the electric cleaning heads you must use one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses.<query> what is cyclonic action</query> When is a power brush or power head required? Broan-NuTone recommends using a power brush to clean carpet. The power brush loosens dirt for proper cleaning and separates and lifts the nap of the carpet to keep it in top condition and proper appearance. Are the turbine air brushes operationally equivalent to the power brushes? Yes. The air-driven turbine is a uniquely designed, non-electric brush for cleaning with the central vacuum system. The electric power brush maintains constant brush action by using of the motor used to run the unit. Is a dedicated electrical circuit required for a central vacuum power unit installation? Yes. The central vacuum system requires its own 15 or 20 amp circuit, depending on the specific power unit you are installing. My central vacuum has lost a lot of its suction. What is the most likely cause?<query> what is the power brush for central vacuum</query> A dirty motor filter may be the cause of poor system performance. Other problems that cause poor system performance are leaky wall valve inlets, blockages in the intake or exhaust piping, or a blockage in the hose. Consult your owner’s manual or call Broan-NuTone Technical support for assistance. How do you remove the power unit’s motor filter? First remove the dust collection canister. After locating the motor filter, grasp the flexible band that holds the filter in place and then pull it to the center of the filter, and it should come free. If you have trouble call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. How can I clear a blockage in the vacuum system? Clearing a blockage in the system can be quite a challenge. You can rent a plumber's snake and then work it through the system piping. Sometimes a small diameter hose worked through your piping may clear a blockage.<query> how to remove motor filter</query> Why does the system keep running even when the hose is removed and the power unit's switch is turned off? The most likely cause is incorrect wiring to your wall valve inlets. Disengage one of the system wires on the front of your power unit and if the system shuts down then you need to verify that the wiring to your wall valve inlets is correct. If the problem persists, call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. back to top Service & Support Contact Support FAQs Video Library National Accounts Finance Credit Application Product Recalls Freight Claims Tax Exempt Forms Markets Construction Data Comm.

Voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when current is passed through the wire. Even the best conductors of electricity, such as copper wire, offer some resistance to the flow of current. This resistance causes a drop in voltage. The greater the resistance of the circuit, the higher the voltage drop. How much voltage drop is acceptable? A voltage drop of 5% at the furthest receptacle in a branch circuit is acceptable for normal efficiency. In a 120 volt, 15 amp circuit, this means that there should be no more than a 6 volt drop (114 volts) at the furthest outlet when the circuit is fully loaded. At what percentage voltage drop does a circuit become hazardous? That depends on several factors: The amount of current flowing through the high resistance connection The amount of resistance of that connection Proximity or contact with combustible materials Available air flow to dissipate heat What causes excessive voltage drop in a branch circuit?<query> what is the voltage drop in a circuit</query> Excessive voltage drop is usually caused by: High resistance connections at wiring junctions or outlet terminals, including: Poor splices anywhere in the circuit Loose or corroded connections anywhere in the circuit Inadequate seating of wire in the slot connection on push-in type receptacles and switches The wire does not meet code (i.e., not heavy enough gauge for the length of the run). What are the consequences of excess voltage drop in a circuit? Excess voltage drop can cause: Inadequate power, causing improper, erratic or no operation—and damage to the equipment being powered. Poor efficiency and wasted energy. Build-up of heat at the high resistance connection or splice, which may be a fire hazard. What is the difference between a switch and a circuit breaker? A switch is a device that interrupts the flow of electricity.<query> what is the cause of voltage drop</query>"

So what criteria did the EU use to issue its unilateral verdict? It crystallises into 3 major points: Use of poorly maintained, obsolete aircraft(Criteria used to ban most African airlines with old soviet era fleet) Inability of airlines to rectify shortcomings identified during inspections by EU Air Safety Committee. Inability of a civil aviation authority responsible for overseeing an airline to perform its task properly(Criteria was used to ban all airlines from Sudan, Iran) African airlines face safety challenges due to poor infrastructure; lack of capacity, poor oversight and policies and unhealthy finances that impede rapid fleet modernization. Also, according to David Learmount, Flight International Operations and Safety Editor, African airlines do not have the “luxury of a safety culture“ since less developed countries tend to have less emphasis on a strong safety culture in the airline operations!Africa aviation is often associated with the ""Flying Coffins"",old Soviet era Antonov aircraft with notorious safety records!<query> why did the eu issue its unilateral verdict</query> An Antonov 225 In spite of the challenges, several African airlines have earned IATA’s IOSA Certification, a global standard for airline safety management.

clueweb12-1100tw-30-02707,28,1,"Aviation experts: Which types of airplane are inherently unsafe? | Airplanes Aviation Home About Contact SiteMap 22 Mar 12 Last Updated on 22 March 2012 Aviation experts: Which types of airplane are inherently unsafe? Airplanes Aviation All About Airplanes 14 Comments Airplane Aviation airplane aviation question by nectar_pepsi: Aviation experts: Which types of airplane are inherently unsafe? Yes I know all types of commerical airplane are supposed to be extremely safe, but surely it is the case that some are inherently less safe than others by design. A few examples: Aircraft with outwards opening cargo doors. Single and twin-engine aircraft with a poor power-to-weight ratio. T-tail aircraft. Get my drift? So can someone give me a list of aircraft that the paranoid flyer should avoid?<query> which types of airplanes are inherently unsafe?</query> Aircraft Design today is guaranteed to be Fail-Safe, and safety depends on the proper maintenance of the aircraft. Old aircraft such as the DC-10, B737-200, DC-9, Fokker 100 and the B747 classic (which are still operated today by some airlines) are safe enough to fly, if subjected to regular maintenance procedures. as to your concerns over outward opening cargo doors, this has been a common design in most new aircraft today, and safety measures have been strictly implemented to ensure that this device does not fail. T-tail designs are not unsafe, although it has some advantages as well as disadvantages. Happy Flying Reply Mxsmanic 22-03-2012, 07:56 There aren’t any aircraft that paranoid flyers should avoid. Inherently unsafe aircraft don’t stay in use for very long. Inherently unsafe design features rapidly disappear for the same reason.<query> what is the most unsafe aircraft</query> It’s very rare for any type of aircraft to show signs of serious design deficiencies that make it truly unsafe, but when this actually happens, the aircraft is removed from service very quickly. A classic historical example is the De Havilland Comet, the first commercial jet airliner, which flew for a time in the 1950s. The aircraft had serious design flaws that caused fatigue cracks to develop rapidly in the fuselage, and a serious of accidents occurred when the aircraft explosively decompressed in midair and were destroyed. The aircraft was rapidly removed from service and never flew again in that specific model (a later model of the Comet corrected the design flaws and flew for many years, and some are still in service). The story of the Comet, though, is very exceptional. Forty years ago, with the entry of a number of T-tailed, rear-engined airliners into service, it was discovered that this type of aircraft can enter an aerodynamic “superstall” from which no recovery is possible.<query> what was the first commercial jet</query> The existence of superstall had not previously been known, and several aircraft were lost before the phenomenon was understood. Today, aircraft of this type have features such as aggressive stick pushers that prevent superstalls, and it is no longer a problem, so one cannot say that these aircraft are unsafe today. Anyway, in summary, if it’s unsafe, it doesn’t fly for long. All civilian transport aircraft currently in service are extremely safe. If you really feel compelled to rank aircraft, I’d suggest avoiding new designs for a decade or so, until they’ve established a record. It’s unlikely that any new aircraft will prove to be truly unsafe, but nobody really knows until they’ve accumulated a lot of time in service. Older aircraft, such as 737s and 747s, have enormous service histories and, while they are not perfect, their safety has been proven by time, and any quirks they might have are very well known and understood.<query> what type of aircraft is unsafe</query> Reply FreeFlyinFool 22-03-2012, 08:20 Just remember, the video on youtube of the auto pilot crashing the jet into the trees…that was an air bus. That airliner that crashed in New York, after shedding the vertical stabilizer… also an air bus. See where I’m going with this? Anyway, back to the question at hand. Every airplane is safe, when operated within it’s intended performance envelope. Fly a plane equipped for vfr only into ifr conditions, and it’s unsafe. All of the things you’ve listed are untrue, as there are certain safety and performance standards around which all aircraft are designed and built. I’ve got 450 hours in a seminole (T-tailed twin) and the company I was flying them for uses them exclusively for over 15k flight hours per year on all of the airframes combined.<query> what is the difference between a plane and an airplane that crashes</query> Their only loss was when one was flipped on the ramp in a hurricane. Reply Larry454 22-03-2012, 08:22 I would say that the following are less safe than the average: 1. Gyrocopters – no margin for error – if the weather arrives at an inopportune time, your chances of landing safely are significantly reduced. 2. Ultralights, especially those that land on water – same as above, but with the added risk of a little extra weight in one float or the other (due to an unseen leak) resulting in an unrecoverable roll on takeoff. 3. Any high performance or experimental aircraft – These are not designed for safety as a primary criterion – they are designed for military or airshow specialized duty. They are therefore inherently less safe than say, a commercial or business aircraft with a long fleet history.<query> what is less safe than the average aircraft</query> 4. Any aircraft, especially a military-type aircraft, that is not being maintained in the manner that it was designed to be maintained. Private owners that own military jets, for example, have to spend huge sums on maintenance – or take their chances. Of course, whenever any of these is operated close to the ground or in limiting conditions like night or weather, then the risk is amplified. Reply Sweet Annie 22-03-2012, 08:59 I would steer clear of any airplane with a drunk pilot. Reply Justin C 22-03-2012, 09:30 i don’t have a problem with flying in a airplane that’s uses jets but if it ever comes to propeller planes i don’t trust those like DC-10s and things like those to me they are just a pringles can with wings Reply Barend D 22-03-2012, 10:24 .If you go and have a look at the accidents in 2006 you will find that aviation in America, Europe, middle east, far east and Australasia did not do bad at all.<query> what type of airplanes can a drunk pilot fly</query> Then you go to the dark continent, Africa. In Africa there are thousands of very old aircraft but 2 manufacturers stands out: Antonov and Ilyushin. These aircraft are mostly privately owned so maintenance is non existing. These 2 names are contributing to more than 80% of Africa’s large aircraft accidents. Reply Tamiyaman188 22-03-2012, 11:14 In my opinion: Unsafe: all the MD/DC, the boeing 737-100/200/300/400/500/700, 727, all propeller equiped planes, 747, 757, A300/310, and all the soviet made planes. Safe Planes: B767, B777, B737-600/800/900, A320, A330, A340. A380 don’t know yet Actually, any type of airplane can be unsafe. It depends on the airline. Design of the airplane can also make it unsafe, but today all modern aircraft are designed to be safe (Stay away from classic aircraft such as the MD-80).<query> what is the most unsafe plane in africa</query> So, the best plane to ride on are planes I’ve categorized as safe above and chose an airline with good safety records. BTW I never or will ever trust any Soviet planes or airlines. Reply Thom 22-03-2012, 11:58 Ones with inherently unsafe pilots. Pilot error (imho) accounts for all but a few accidents and incidents.

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree. I would like to take flying lessons but as I am stationed in England (not to mention my newborn baby), it's seemingly impossible right now.<query> what is the scope of a plane</query> Well that's enough about me. Basically I just have these few questions: 1. What education level is required, or preferred, to fly the ""big iron""? 2. Do most pilots start out flying small props to gain flying hours, or do some airlines offer a training program to start you out on jetliners? 3. As I am 27 now, does that somewhat hamper me because of my late start? 4. Do you have just any general tips for me to follow to achieve my newfound dream of becoming and airline pilot? Nash Hi Nash, 1. To be a pilot, a degree is preferable but not an absolute requirement. It depends on the Airlines. The Cadet Pilot or Airline Sponsorship Program is very competitive and usually the cream is selected.<query> what is the education level to become an airline pilot</query> For instance, in one recent advert for sponsorship in UK (they have stopped this program today), there were 40,000 applications for the 100 positions available. However, not all is lost if you do not meet the stringent entry requirements. In your case, are you able to change your trade to become an Air Force pilot to gain some flying experience? Most flying jobs in the military would require a college degree although there are a few exceptions. Your military flying hours are usually recognized in civil aviation. Once you have accumulated sufficient flying hours in the Air Force, enroll yourself into a Commercial Pilot's License course first. When your term with the Air Force expires, you would most likely be ready to seek employment in the civil sector as a co pilot in a multiengine transport airplane. You will have to work your way from the bottom of the ladder but you will not regret for you will learn a lot on the right hand seat.<query> how to become an air force pilot</query> Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License. Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer it take. jawed nasim , 14 Jun, 2010 +0 is becoming a pilot a big problem...? not at all....!!! hi friends, now its very easy to become pilot.. become a pilot with 200 hrs flying exp.

Pilot Career - Becoming a Pilot Friday, 09 May 2008 08:48 Hello Captain Lim, I was wondering if you would be able to give me some advice or tips on the best route to become a major airline pilot as you are. I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree.<query> what is the best route to become an airline pilot</query> thanks David , 05 Dec, 2011 +0 what to do if I want to be a pilot in Indian Air force?

Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines. If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer. All the best to your dreams !

The second thing to do is to take a trial lesson to see if you really like that environment and you feel comfortable doing this as a career, i.e. you if you want to become a pilot. Of course if you are young, then talking to the family will help, and getting their support will be important for your flying career. Also, try to learn as much as much as possible about flying and aircrafts. Learning to fly is an expensive business unless you are luck enough to be chosen for the air force to be trained as a military pilot or get selected for one of the very few airline sponsorship programs. So knowing what to expect in becoming a pilot is very important to reduce the flying training costs.

First a word from our sponsors... For anyone attending the event that may be lurking here, I renew the plea that Katie has stated in the One Voice thread for someone to try to start a dialog with Lazaris and/or Concept:Synergy about the many questions that are out there (see the One Voice thread for some interesting questions).<query> what is the difference between lazaris and disneyworld</query> Also enclosed was an eight page 8.5"" by 11"" flyer entitled, ""Lazaris Explains Lazaris"" with a subtitle ""The following are excerpts of a tape Lazaris made to answer some of the many questions people have about him"" with photos of a much-younger Jach, implying it's about 10 years old. Has anyone else seen this? I think the alarm has been raised, they've circled the wagons. I'll be interested to see if they let me join this forum. If they don't, they've got people watching this site and the registration process. What a crying shame. Irene IP: Logged Katie Administrator Posts: 3320 Registered: May 2001 posted 07-26-2001 02:41 PM Hi Irene, Thank you very much for sharing that information.<query> how old is lazaris</query> Isn't it interesting how since we first started discussion the possibility of Con:Sin being a cult that they have begun to act more and more demonstrably like one? I mean, what the hell is the big deal? Why all the secrecy and control over information? Does it make any sense at all? I know the party line is that they are protecting Jach and ""Lazaris"", or their privacy or something, but wouldn't you think that A. Jach and Lazaris would be able to protect themselves? B. That they should just come right out and say that this is an exclusive group that you have to jump through hoops to join? or C. That Lazaris could tell them in a flash exactly what any given person's agenda is? Surely the Grand Orb would be more than happy and willing to participate in keeping Con:Sin ""safe""!<query> is con sin a cult</query> One more bit of evidence IMO that there is no such being. Oh, right, I forgot, they claim to provide ""safety"" and ""privacy"" for the posters there too. Now, I ask you, where was all that safety and privacy while Peny was busy thrashing about in the Forum, during her private nastiness orgies behind the scenes, and how private exactly are those ""private readings""? It's just unreal to me the paranoia that exudes from those nutters. One thing I've learned in life is that paranoid people are that way because they themselves are not trustworthy and they fear that everyone else is just like them. And, yes, Irene, you can be quite sure that Con:Sin closely monitors this site and that someone there is charged with responsibility to read every word.<query> why are people paranoid</query> But that puts them between a rock and a hard place, because like you said, if they refuse you membership that is a clear indication that they do read here, but their official word on this site is that it's just a bunch of negative ego bad energy people and not worth the bother. Someone once reported that the employees at Con:Sin are forbidden to read here. (right!) I do have this sneaking suspicion that Jach is kept pretty much in the dark though. We can't have our teddy bear bothered with any disturbing thoughts now, can we, especially now with his personal pit bull in the grave. I remember reading the Closure thread from the Gangsters in which all are instructed to sit quietly and listen, but not respond. (yeah, Gang, people send me all this stuff, so much for your prized privacy!)<query> is con sin a good place to read</query> Anyway, the Gang goes on and on about what a wonderfully loving person Peny was, and how they were all healed by her love, and that she never hurt anyone, people just thought she did! (Give me a break! Wouldn't you call that being MISUNDERSTOOD???????, isn't that by Peny's definition a clear sign of being in MARTYRHOOD???????) Oh, right, no, it's because stupid people can't tell the difference between being hurt and being loved. Well, my point is that you have to wonder if these Gangsters really believe themselves, or if they had shotguns held to their heads while they were writing. Damn that is one bizarre group! Please do let us know how well you fare in being accepted into that very special group!<query> why is peny a gangster</query> I trust they will not find you to be ""inappropriate"". If they do, trust me, they'll never tell you in what way, or who made the judgement call. It's all blamed on ""intuition"" but we never hear whose. I really like it that you are willing to be open about your process with Con:Sin, Irene. It is this kind of disclosure that really helps illustrate the workings and mentality of that group. I do hope you are not too incredibly invested in becoming a Forum member! If you don't, please don't despair, ""private"" Forum information floats across the internet about as freely as McDonald's double-cheesburger wrappers across the freeway. Katie IP: Logged Irene Member Posts: 14 Registered: Jul 2001 posted 07-26-2001 04:13 PM Hi, Katie: My attempt to join the other Con:Sin Forum is simply to see what defenses they have, not to actually become a member.<query> who is con sin</query> Here's what I think: I think we're talking major fraud going across state lines which has nasty federal implications. I think that there's a Con:Sin Board of Directors somewhere and would love to know who's on it. I think that Jach Purcell knows as much as Nixon knew... not fully immersed, but calling the shots. I think we don't know Jach's or Peny's or Michaell's real names(what's with the bullshit mis-spellings... so that they can align themselves closer to Lazarus? I know, it's that numerology thing!). I think it's not about protection of Jach's privacy, it's about non-disclosure of fradulent activities. I don't know of one other Forum where I've had to be scrutinized (I'm not really a BBer... and there are nutters on all the major news BBs!<query> who is jach purcell</query> -- another indication that they're scared now. Frankly, I think the gig is up. Nothing would surprise me about Jach over the next few months. If he doesn't disappear, I bet he'll flee (under advice from Lazaris, of course)... he must have enough money to live the rest of his life in Europe/South America in great comfort. I try not to be so judgemental these days, and to make a point, I didn't even negatively judge Clinton... he so embodies the very best and worst of our age group. And, I'm pro-choice from birth to death and have made so many wrong choices in hindsight. Duh. But, I will keep you all posted. You gave me a thought. I was thinking that they would find out that my ""application"" followed my visit here and would deny me entrance so I couldn't see what was being said on their site.<query> who is jach clinton</query> Duh! If I'm denied entrance to their site for any reason, including one of massive web site melt-down, I'll conclude they have everything to hide. Later...

And lets not forget the secret video cameras in the bathrooms, on the rides in the tunnels, lest any fool think the rides aren't good enuf without a puff on a joint..

Then there's the junk food, now I know they don't serve food at all the events(lucky for the attendees)I HEARD about the crime that was passed off for food in the millenium-farce event... sounds like McYuck coulda done a better job catering THAT!! I think if they did serve food we could all pretty much guess what it would be...did I hear DORITOS are one of Jach-lard ass' fav. crunchy things..... Just a quickie mention about the link between junk-food, and psycopathic behaviour. And I must mention the cross-over marketing of disney and Mcyuck-food/toys does it remind you of something??.if you wanna have the full metaphysical Bizzarus experience you have to DRESS like the conoscenti!<query> does mcyuck serve food</query> Naturally, only do this if you are comfortable doing it. I know that in my own case, the idea of even MENTALLY questioning Lazaris was frightening. Then I thought it through... If Lazaris is exactly who he claims to be, he should not have any problem questioning ANYTHING he says. If he is the ""forever and a day"" type friend, he would be proud of my questioning him. If, however, he has a problem with me questioning anything relating to him or the organization that he associates himself with, then I am glad to find that out and I will choose to pick other friends. A final plea...please inform others at the seminar of the existence of this web sight. Don't forget to mention the ""/lazaris"" part of the address as the main page doesn't have a link to the Lazaris section (hint, hint Ted! ).<query> who is lazaris</query> you have to wear crystals like us, you have to OWN BIG crystals, you have to collect all the action-figures.... you should embrace every aspect of what we embrace, which grows more an more bizzare (BAZZARR)((with colorful-caftans and all)) Then there's the Disney movie that shows very blatantly the political views, sociological values of the Nazi's that run that conglomerate.... that's gonna take too much space here...but the overview is: stay enslaved by what society tells you is acceptable behaviour.. Replace your desires for a full meaningful life with the desire for ""things"" disney tells you that you want..ie: for women/girls:tiny waist,for boys/men: big muscles,for both: needy-greedy romance. **with little twittering birdies around your head*<query> what is the disney movie about</query> *...

(background tinkley mucsic inserted here)keep-em comin back for more... almost ironic that Disney's just come out with ATLANTIS.!! * **such timing***..WHEN'S ARTHUR /knights o' the round table coming..or have they done that one already??

You said: They e-mailed back to say that they didn't have my name on their mailing list... I guess they were too cheap to keep sending you information about their latest and greatest product since you didn't seem to be generating any revenue lately. With the inevitable drop in the customer base that will happen in the upcoming months (assuming they even keep this schtick going that long), I wonder if they will have to resort to infomercials. I can hear it now...get the ""Negative<query> who is craig ip</query> Ego"" tape. It will teach you to slice, dice, and chop up any adversary. And if you order within the next 10 minutes, we'll throw in a free copy of ""Shame XXVIII, the Impact of Orion"".

Irene IP: Logged TedV Member Posts: 922 Registered: Apr 2001 posted 07-26-2001 07:12 PM Hi Craig, You asked if anyone has felt any accuracy with the alleged month energies as delineated by the Grand Orb-meister.<query> how much does lazaris cost</query> The tough months of year 2000 were supposed to be February, April and September. Well, Feb was a bit rough for for me - I got into an altercation with the Forum Gang. April was tough - it was Forum Storm. By September I was only about 90% sure that Jach was a fraud. I knew that Sept was supposed to be tough, but we could mitigate the damage by following Sparkey's advice. I hadn't listened to the 2000 tape for several months, and I purposely refused to listen again. I wanted to see how September would fare outside of the artificial reality hell known as Concept:Synergy. Well, September was a rather normal month, not great, not terrible. Except it was great because I had learned to face reality without the orb crutch. (Kinda like purposely walking under a ladder to disprove the superstition) I went back and listened to the tape to see if Lazaris had suggested anything useful.<query> what was the toughest month of the year</query> I don't remember what ""they"" suggested, but it was more specific than simply loving oneself and having a positive attitude (which I did). I didn't use any of the techniques, yet the month was smooth. Amazing - must have been residual good karma for all the work I had done with the material - yeah, that's it. I think I posted somewhere else in here awhile back that, to my knowledge, Lazaris never predicted any major event - such as the 1989 Santa Cruz earthquake, the downing of the Berlin Wall, the death of Princess Diana, the death of Peny(?), the demise of Concept:Synergy... They predict that there will be earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific Rim, that there will be violence in the Middle East, there will be some governmental scandal...<query> what did lazaris predict</query> Stuff that no one without exeptional insight could guess Cheers, Ted IP: Logged Craig Member Posts: 698 Registered: Jul 2001 posted 07-27-2001 09:36 PM Hi Ted, You said: I went back and listened to the tape to see if Lazaris had suggested anything useful.

I know this because I first found this site about a week ago and have just about finished reading every thread. Even though I skimmed over some posts that I thought were irrelevant, it took most of my free time over 5 or so days to do this. There is an incredible amount of ""fluff"" in the reading, including fights between parties with differing opinions. To help me with my own process, I have collected what I consider to be the ""juicy"" (i.e. relevant) parts of the threads. Also as part of my process, I am writing down my interpretation and opinions in a summary of the material. Hopefully this may assist others who do not want to invest the time and energy reading through this entire site.<query> how many posts on a forum</query> That would be an instance where they truly might ""throw their spirituality out the window"". For those still in the fold, it might be interesting to journal your thoughts about the energy of each month after it happened. For this to be meaningful, the person must NOT listen to the tapes until after the year is over (to eliminate any self fulfilling influence and to avoid interpreting the events with a biased spin). How accurate were they?

It would be interesting to see what a historian, journalist, or some other expert that has no vested interest one way or another in Lazaris to review past tapes and comment on their accuracy.

If I had known that, I would have had my suspicions long before I did. Wouldn't it make sense for ""Lazaris"" to mention, the night before, that they felt the quake's energy culminating ""in your reality"", and offer a meditaion where they ""will join our energy with yours""? OK, maybe they didn't want to panic people. Uh, no, that explanation doesn't work. Otherwise, we should get rid of our smoke detectors lest they cause a panic. And we should stop research on earthquake early warnings. And we should not tell people to batten down the hatches when a hurricane approaches.

Chow, Audrey IP: Logged Craig Member Posts: 698 Registered: Jul 2001 posted 07-31-2001 01:50 PM Hi Audrey, If my memory serves me correctly, the earthquake was at 4-5AM. That would be just 6 or so hours after our Saturday night ""healing"" meditation. Being from the East Coast, I was rattled indeed.<query> when was the earthquake in chow</query> Being close to the top of the hotel only magnified things. For a year or so after, I would wake in the middle of the night whenever a truck went by on a road about a 1/4 mile away from my house as my body could actually feel the vibrations from the truck. I will use the usual initials of PTSD with a twist as it applied to me: Post Tremor Sensitivity Disorder. A warning would have been most appreciated. Knowing that everything was going to be all right would have been most helpful. Not having any experience with earthquakes, I had no means to evaluate how bad this one was while it was happening. I remember thinking how I just might die now. I have only felt that way so strongly one other time in my life (which I described coincidentally in another post today).<query> what is the initials for ptsd</query> Thanks again for the warning, all knowing friend!

Sorry for the diversion... It stuck me this morning that there are many analogies between Disneyworld and the Lazaris material: 1) There is an unquestionable magic in Disneyworld. 2) There is so much put together in one place, some of which is just brilliant. There is a diversity of material. While all of the pieces are available elsewhere, it offers the convenience of not having to search all over for the pieces of the puzzle. 3) The price of admission is high and continues each time you visit. You notice a lot of overpriced merchandise is being sold to go along with the experience. 4) Some people can't stand the place and don't visit again. 5) Some people love the place and can't get enough of it.<query> what is the difference between disney world and lazaris</query> 6) Even as the place expands over the years, it grows tired for many. At that time they start searching for other sources of entertainment, even if it means forgoing the luxury of having the experience spoon-feed to you in one convenient place. For others, the magic remains. 7) The employees are treated and/or act in a cult-like fashion. Behind the scenes, they probably despise the visitors. 8) Sometimes you have to wait in long lines (like the Crystal Ceremony) for a ride on Space Mountain and others. As you examine the experience, you realize how much fluff time there is. 9) You can pay extra money and get a ""special"" tour specially designed to enhance and expedite your experience (""magic time""/personal consultations). I realize analogies only go so far, but they can be fun.<query> how do you get magic time at space mountain</query> Any others come to mind?

Well. First I had to call. Then Rene tole me that I had to e-mail their site with the answers to three questions: 1) Who told me about Lazaris?, 2) What Lazaris materials am I currently working with? and, 3) Why I want to join the forum!

I also became a practicing thinking astrologer, believing it to be a ""trend"" tool at least as accurate as forecasting weather trends. Read Cayce, Seth, others. Did Tarot.

They e-mailed back to say that they didn't have my name on their mailing list and couldn't begin processing my application for membership until they have it. I told them I stopped receiving flyers about a year ago. They then responded by saying that it would take about a week to process my application. Application????!!!!

clueweb12-0309wb-83-27220,29,1,"Thirsty and/or hot? Stop by Ice Station Cool for a chance to get out of the hot Florida sun, and to try soft drinks from the world over for free. It is a great way to cool off and get some refreshments. (This is the ""ice cave"" located near Innoventions West.) If you or your children like animals, visit The Living Seas pavilion. It is the largest saltwater aquarium in the world. You can see dolphins, seals, tons of fish, sharks, and many other sea creatures. Nothing wild here, except the wildlife! As for World Showcase, my best recommendation would be to explore every country. There is so much to take in here. For rides and/or attractions, do not miss the following: El Rio del Tiempo in Mexico, The American Adventure, and any show in the America Gardens Theater.<query> what is the world showcase</query> If you have little mouseketeers, there are KIDCOT FUNSTOPS set up in every country. Here, kids can do all kinds of fun things with Cast Members. At night be sure to see Illuminations: Reflections of Earth laser light and fireworks display. World Showcase is the perfect place to enjoy a theme park without having to face a lot of thrill rides. ------------------------ DISNEY-MGM STUDIOS ------------------------ When you are in the Disney-MGM Studios your best choices are ones without the explosions, scary aliens, or names like ""Catastrophe Canyon."" One of the top attractions offered is Muppet Vision 3-D. It is a hilarious look at Kermit and the gang's attempt at a 3-D movie -- nothing really scary or wild here, although it does tend to get a bit loud. You will find a lot of good, tame attractions in the Studios, many of which appeal in particular to fearful little ones (although grown-ups can enjoy them too).<query> what is the best disney mgm attraction</query> They include Playhouse Disney Live on Stage, featuring Bear in the Big Blue House, Rolie Polie Olie, Stanley and Pooh, and Voyage of the Little Mermaid, a multimedia version of the Disney tale. Next visit Beauty and the Beast, Live on Stage. There is even an arcade and pizza place, Toy Story Pizza Planet Arcade. ----------------------- ANIMAL KINGDOM ----------------------- I visited Animal Kingdom for the first time about six months ago. It has risen to a tie with Epcot as my favorite park, and I have yet to see everything. My descriptions of attractions within this park are going to be very generic, as I do not want to give away the surprises that await you. The first thing you must do upon entering the most amazing creation (in my opinion) that Disney has ever undertaken is visit The Tree of Life.<query> what is the name of the disney park</query> All I will say is make sure your camera is ready to go! After Tree of Life, venture over to Camp Minnie-Mickey Character Greeting Trails. Here you will find Mickey, Minnie, and friends waiting to say hello and take some pictures with guests. Two good shows for everyone to visit are Festival of the Lion King and Pocahontas and her Forest Friends. These are among the most magical shows in the park. Festival of the Lion King is a wonderful spectacle featuring the music of the movie, while Pocahontas is a live animal show about conservation. Even though DinoLand, USA has the rollicking Dinosaur ride and the wild Primeval Whirl, it also hosts several tamer attractions. For kids, there's The Boneyard playground, and even adults can have a good time at Chester and Hester's DinoRama. They can even go for a spin on the Dumbo-like TriceraTop Spin and play several carnival style games.<query> what is the best place to visit in dinoland</query> (I visited DinoRama during my most recent trip and have to admit, at the age of 30, I had fun.) Four absolute musts in Animal Kingdom are: Kilimanjaro Safaris, Wildlife Express Train to Rafiki's Planet Watch, Rafiki's Planet Watch and Maharajah Jungle Trek. Again, so that I do not give too much away, make certain the camera is ready to go. Stop by the petting zoo to see the animals. In the afternoon jam with Mickey and friends in Mickey's Jammin' Jungle Parade. ----------------------- TOP 10 LISTS ----------------------- Here's my list of the top 10 best rides/attractions for wimps: 1) Tree of Life - Animal Kingdom 2) Kilimanjaro Safaris - Animal Kingdom 3) Spaceship Earth - Epcot 4) Tomorrowland Transit Authority - Magic Kingdom 5) Mickey's PhilharMagic - Magic Kingdom 6) Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Maharajah Jungle Trek - Animal Kingdom 8) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 9) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 10) World Showcase - Epcot My suggestions for the best rides/attractions for not-so-bold youngsters: 1) Playhouse Disney Live on Stage - Disney-MGM Studios 2) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 3) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 4) Mickey's Toontown Fair - Magic Kingdom 5)<query> what is the best ride in animal kingdom</query> The Boneyard - Animal Kingdom 6) The petting zoo in Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Dumbo the Flying Elephant - Magic Kingdom 8) Cinderella's Golden Carrousel - Magic Kingdom 9) Camp Minnie-Mickey - Animal Kingdom 10) KIDCOT Funstops throughout World Showcase in Epcot I hope that any of you who have been concerned about being a ride ""wimp,"" or about not being able to have fun without riding all the rides, are now feeling a bit more at ease. If an attraction is not mentioned, it does not necessarily mean I consider it a bad choice. This article was based on my opinions of what people like myself (who don't like wild and crazy rides) would feel comfortable about trying while on vacation in Disney World.

But what if you're like me, and you don't enjoy the ""wild"" rides? You know, the ones that spin around at dizzying speeds, that make you feel ill, or hang you upside down? Is it possible for those of us who are ride ""wimps"" to still have a good time at Walt Disney World? Now, don't be offended by my use of the word ""wimp."" By ""wimp,"" I mean you are like me -- the type of person who loves amusement parks, but a carousel is about as wild and crazy as you are willing to get. For people like us, adult and children alike, the idea of being dropped 13 stories faster than you can say ""Mickey Mouse"" holds no appeal.<query> what is the name of the rides at disney world</query> The more I thought about this recently, the more I began to wonder whether I was the only Disney Wimp out there. Maybe there are many others like me, or maybe there are parents who would love to bring their children to Disney World, but are unsure of what rides and attractions are suitable. Well, fear not! I am going to give you park by park recommendations of the rides and attractions I find easygoing for everyone. I may even clear up some confusion about attractions whose names sound scary but really aren't. (For years I shivered at the very idea of going on the Haunted Mansion in the Magic Kingdom. One day, my mother said, ""But it's not scary, it's actually funny."" So I swallowed my fears, only to learn that once again mother did know best.)<query> what rides are fun for kids at disney world</query> Yes, you can be a wimp when it comes to rides and attractions, and have the time of your life in WDW. ------------------------ MAGIC KINGDOM ------------------------ You will be pleased to know that you have to travel no further than right inside the Magic Kingdom to find the first ride that is wonderful for us wimps: The Walt Disney World Railroad. This is a great ride for everyone as it travels slowly around the perimeter of the park. Riders can ride the train for the whole trip or get off at different stations (Main Street USA, Frontierland, and Mickey's Toontown Fair). In Tomorrowland you will find one of the best rides for older children and adults: Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin. OK, before you run to hide under Andy's bed at the thought of going on a ride with the word ""spin"" in it, read on.<query> what rides are in disney world</query> This is a ride/ game where you get to control how much your vehicle spins. What could be better? This ride is great for most children, though some little kids may not be able to see well and some may be frightened of the aliens. All in all, no matter if you are a little or big kid, this is a lot of fun. While walking through Tomorrowland, you may notice blue vehicles traveling above the park. Do not be afraid of this ride, which is known as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (or the TTA to seasoned travelers). I know many of you are thinking, ""What do you mean travel above the park?"" Relax! Once you realize how beautiful the park is from that height, and how nice it is to be seated for 15 minutes, you will love the TTA.<query> what is the tta ride</query> Plus, you can say you went into Space Mountain without ever having to ride it. (The TTA travels through the Space Mountain building for about one minute). If you are lucky enough that the Carousel of Progress is operational during your stay, you must not miss it. A good number of adults may recognize this from the 1964 World's Fair. It is a wonderful look at the progress in our world from the turn of the 20th century to the start of the 21st century. After visiting Tomorrowland, go to Fantasyland, where there are a number of good attractions just for us wimps. Head for It's a Small World, which is a great choice. How can you resist a boat ride featuring singing and dancing dolls and animals? (Editor's Note: You'll have to wait until spring 2005, though --<query> what to do in tomorrowland</query> It's a Small World is closed until then for a rehab!) Then go right across the way to Peter Pan's Flight. The only scary thing about this one is how long you will have to wait without a FASTPASS. This ride takes you on a magical journey over London just like Peter, Wendy, and the children did in the story. One of my favorite rides in the Magic Kingdom also happens to be another great choice for wimps: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Riders are loaded into Honey Pots for their journey into the Hundred Acre Wood to visit with Pooh and friends. A new and awesome attraction debuted in Fantasyland in the fall of 2003: Mickey's PhilharMagic. This attraction is a 3-D show unlike any you have seen before. Using the largest projection screen in the world and brand new 3-D technology, Disney brings it to life like only they can.<query> what rides are in magic kingdom</query> Enjoy a funny, musical performance with Mickey, Donald, and all the gang. Little children seem to have a mixed reaction to this show, possibly because of the loudness, so use your own judgment. Two of the tamest rides, which are really good choices for younger kids, are Cinderella's Golden Carrousel and Dumbo the Flying Elephant. Most little children love carrousels and choosing their own horse to ride on. And even though Dumbo goes up in the air, riders can control how high they go. Don't neglect Liberty Square while on your tour. Here you will find the aforementioned Haunted Mansion. I promise it isn't really that scary, except perhaps for those who have a fear of the dark. Visit the Hall of Presidents for a calm show which features every president of the United States. Last but not least, wimps should be sure to stay for the Share A Dream Come True parade, Spectromagic parade, and the Wishes fireworks.<query> what is the tamest rides in the world</query> (If someone in your party does not like loud noises, I would advise skipping Wishes.) Share a Dream Come True is one of the most beautiful parades I have seen. ------------------------ EPCOT ------------------------ In Epcot, you come across one of my favorite rides, Spaceship Earth. This attraction is inside the huge gleaming globe that is the symbol of Epcot. You will travel, at a slow pace, through the history of communication. After Spaceship Earth, venture toward The Land pavilion, as this offers some good options for wimps. In this pavilion you will find the gentle boat ride Living with the Land, which offers you a behind the scenes look at agriculture and how Disney and NASA are working together on better ways to grow food. (It may sound boring but it really isn't.) You will also find the entertaining and educational Circle of Life movie starring Timon and Pumbaa from the Lion King.<query> what is the name of the boat ride at epcot</query>"
clueweb12-1313wb-12-12063,29,1,"What Would I Do If I Ran: Disney World First of all, their greatest celebration, in my opinion, was their twentieth anniversary. Why, you ask? Because it was not mentioned too much, but proved to be a great surprise. Disney should have done the same for the 25th anniversary. A low key advertising campaign, with a wonderful surprise celebration waiting for the people when they got to the park. You can see in The Lost World how much I loved their twentieth anniversary. But, enough with celebrations. Disney has the land, and they have the money. They shouldn't kill Horizons. That is the last of the originals that they haven't retouched to date, and it's still a damn good ride. Sure, it costs money to run the attraction, but its not like Disney is poor.<query> what is disney world's twentieth anniversary</query> They can afford it. For the planned space attraction, they should build an entirely new building, near Imagination perhaps. Somewhere.... But, at least keep one of the original rides in tact as it was the day it first opened. (I know what you're thinking. Imagination hasn't been changed from opening...the ride that is. But, the upstairs has, as well as the movie shown at the Theater. Therefore, I say that Imagination is no longer intact. I don't could the Living Seas as one of the originals even though it was on the drawing board since the first day, simply because it took five years to open it, and the Wonders of Life is still a relatively new attraction. Therefore, Horizons is the last of the originals.) The Wild Animal Kingdom is a good idea, but its not a great idea.<query> what is the last animal kingdom ride</query> The concept is obviously meant to compete with Busch's two Florida theme parks, Sea World, and Busch Gardens: The Dark Continent. But, there is one thing Busch Gardens has that WAK won't, and that is regular rides. Themed rides, and dark rides are great, and personally I perfer Disney's rides to any others, but, Busch has a lot going for it. The only similarity WAK and The Dark Continent will have is the fact that both employ african safari type of deals inside of the park. But, that's it. So, building a Animal Park probably isn't going to stop Busch from making money (for my opinion on that, see the Busch version of this home page.) What I would have done is used the plans for Disney's America, and built the park down in Florida.<query> what is the difference between busch gardens and wak</query> That would have left enough land for another park to be built. What would the other park be, you might ask. Well to truly compete with Busch, you want to add the element of Amusement style rides to your parks, so why not build something like Disney's Coney Island. They could have their own version of the Cyclone, and attempt to show what Coney Island would be like today, if Disney ran it, complete with modern super rollercoasters, built by Swedish firms, the names of which I still can't pronounce. Each could have parades, or nighttime shows. Imagine, an Independence Celebration in front of a replica of Independence Hall every night, celebrating as if they were back in time, on July 4, 1776. In Coney Island, you wouldn't have to limit yourself to fireworks.<query> what is the name of disney's coney island</query> How about putting Night Magic in there, from Tokyo Disneyland. Or better yet, you could bring back the Main Street Electric Parade. I can't even begin to imagine what the Daytime entertainment will be at WAK, let alone the Nighttime parade and/or fireworks. But, I digress...... Concentrating on Florida is one thing, but in a few years, it will be so crowded with parks and attractions that companies won't know what to do. Let's face it, we can all see why Six Flags never tried to enter the Orlando theme park business. The main thing to do now is to find other areas that have a high amount of visitors to Florida each year, and build another park there. I'm sure some Brazilian firms would jump at the chance to build a park in Brazil, given the amount of Brazilians that go to Disney World each year.<query> what is the name of the theme park in florida</query> But there are other areas where there are few visitors come to Disney World each year, but a Disney park would prosper simply because the people don't want to travel to the US. Take the Middle East for example. A Disney park would probably prosper there well (don't laugh at this prospect, because a Disneyland in the Middle East was in the works supposedly at one time). What about China, or India... Both of those countries would do well with Disney, and if Disney went to China, it would represent a step taken by the company to stop the video piracy that goes on in that country. (Ok maybe that's taking it a little too far, but the prospect of Disney say in Hong Kong, next to the planned Jackie Chan theme park would work out very well).<query> where would disney world be located</query> Probably Disney's best bet would be to start building in Australia. Many other movie companies have realized the use of Australia as a site for not only filming, but for Theme Park building, companies like Warner Brothers. Fox had both of its Power Ranger movies filmed entirely, or in part, in Australia. Now is the time for Disney to act before its too late. Or....is it already too late. While Disney are still pioneers in the fields in which they've conquered, they seem to continue to lose touch with the people. Its no wonder that films like Air Bud, or Kazaam fail. Its not what the kids want and its not what the parents want. But, its becoming increasingly hard to film a good kids movie now adays. They had a great formula with their Honey I Shrunk series, but they ruined it with Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.<query> where was power ranger filmed</query> Movies like 101 Dalmatians work, but the music is missed. A live action musical version of those types of movies would work out good. But I have no room to talk because 101 Dalmatians did very well at the box office. But, kids like musicals. This is apparent through the constant success of the Disney animated movies. Even if the movies are not number one at the box office, they realize wonderful profits simply through mercandizing, which Disney is king of. But, as Disney continues to attempt to break into Broadway with ligitimate musical versions of their animated films, perhaps they should take a look the other way. Muicals like Evita work because they have already attracted a big audience, but it doesn't work well with the kids. Something like a remake of Guys and Dolls, Me and My Girl, or even a completely new musical designed by their popular composers.<query> what kind of movies are there for kids</query> This was how Disney was so successful in the 60's. Think of how endearing Mary Poppins was, or the 70's Pete's Dragon. One of my favorite Disney live action films of all time, even my favorite musical of all time, was The Happiest Millionare. Disney had a formula, and their movies made you feel good. I suppose Disney will never take the hint though, and it might cause them to lose out in the end. With other companies like Fox, Warner Brothers, and Universal expanding their family lines of movies, creating very good, if not better, family movies than Disney, one wonders what the future holds for the Disney company.

For those that are not in the know, the UK price should be closer to £114, so you can see why UK people will reject this box pretty much straight away. What got me thinking though was simple, will a Playstation 3 (which is now $250 or £190) do a better job then the boxee box as well as provide more content in the way of games and such?<query> what is the difference between a boxee box and a playstation 3</query> A Quick review of the boxee software You can download Boxee software to run on Windows, Linux and OS X for free, this is the same interface and functionality as the thing above but of course you provide the hardware. The interface is geared to be used by a remote but you can use the keyboard and mouse. What you will find is that it is very hard to navigate around using a mouse, especially when you are trying to go through the unidentified movie’s it has found. What you need to do is go into the settings and add some media sources, tell it what it will find there and it will go off and try and index your files. This is the main screen and from here you can jump to 6 sections as listed – this been Photo’s, Music, Movies, TV Shows, Apps and Files.<query> what is boxee software</query> Photos presents just a folder you can go into and do slideshows and such from there. Music gives you the option to look at artist or album. When we jump into movies, boxee will go off to imdb and other services to get you cover art as well as a bio of the movie. TV Shows is not quite what it seems, if you think you can now sit and watch Live TV, then you will be disappointed at this stage, this is what Boxee thinks is your TV show collection and a lot depends on the naming of files in your shared drive. If your running Windows, may I suggesttheRenamer which will correct all your TV shows for you. In my case, Boxee has not managed to get the complete list of my TV Shows, this will involve a lot of work in the backend of the boxee software to tell it what my files are and put them in the right group.<query> what is the difference between tv shows and movies</query> Last on the list then – Apps, these are effectively Web based pages and for example the Tech Buzz one opens up previous shows to watch or you can click watch live which will take you to his web site to watch the live video. Unidentified Videos After it had scanned my files, it had a long list of movies it had no idea what they were, this was odd as I made sure I named them the correct way. I had to go in and do a search on the name, find the right movie and then it would add it to the right list. This is my eyes was a lot of work and some movies for example had UK naming which it failed on as it only knew of the USA names for movies. Boxee conclusion I never really rated boxee that much, in the same light as Google TV and other such things, I do not see any difference to a standalone media player (such as the WDTV) given how much this box was or even building yourself a Linux Media device for example.<query> what is the difference between google tv and boxee</query> Playstation 3 as a media device Most people including my good friend there would only see the PS3 as a mean to play games and would dismiss this idea without a second thought The PS3 can either come with a 160GIG HD or 320GIG and to make it even better – you can add your own such as 1TB 2.5″ Drive if you really wanted to store all the media on there. It has gigabit networking as well as wireless. Using the PS3MediaServer you can make the PS3 play any format out there, this is a program you run on a computer of your choice (Linux, Windows or OSX) and it streams to the PS3. If you have a NAS Drive (as I do) this can also act as a media server and as the PS3 can play Flash, you can watch Live TV (in the UK at least) usingCatchUP TV or the in-built tuner on your TV of course.<query> what media player can play flash</query> The upshot also is it has a BluRay player and it can play some amazing game, has a keyboard add-on, remote control and Move.. In Conclusion In my own view, the PS3 is a much better choice given you can play games, browse the web and play BluRays. I would suggest you the software fromBoxee Software as well as XMBC before you start splashing money over the counter on things that may well not do what you wanted them to do.

Green tea, on the other hand, is a healthy drink because it is a decent source of antioxidant polyphenols. A refreshing and calorie-safe beverage, green tea works as a good substitute for unhealthy beverages regularly consumed in today's lifestyles. So, now that both sugar-free coffee and green tea are healthy, we wonder which is healthier. Let's take a look... Advantages of green tea Green tea contains flavonoids (epigallocatechin ) gallate, or EGCG. New research published in the Journal of Nutrition reports that flavonoids EGCG extracts of green tea lower the harmful effects of high blood sugar. This EGCG can prevent damage to the major organs like the coronary arteries lining of theheart muscle.<query> is green tea healthy</query> (via) Some researches have found that green tea reduces the respiration quotient and increases your metabolic rate, albeit temporarily and to a marginal extent only. One study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1999, reports that those drinking green tea increased their total energy expenditure by 3.5 percent and a jump in the proportion of energy came from fat, which rose from 31 to 41 percent. (via) Advantages of sugar-free coffee A longitudinal study in 2009 found that moderate coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of developing dementia in addition to Alzheimer's disease. Some preliminary research evidence shows that coffee acts against beta-amyloid plaque that may have a causative role in Alzheimer's. These findings were published in the January 2009 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. A moderate coffee drinker who drinks around 3-4 cups of coffee in a day had 65 % less chances of getting dementia later in life.<query> does coffee help dementia</query> This is a new study from the University Of Kuopio, Finland and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Research has shown that a person who is a moderate coffee drinker has less chances of getting gallstones diseases. Two such studies were done by the Harvard School Of Public Health. Caffeine is the most commonly consumed psychoactive drug in the world. If you take caffeine in the form of coffee, it will increase the effectiveness of the pain killers, especially in migraine andheadache medications. Some primarily studies has shown that coffee helps boost short term memory. The study in 2005 was presented at the annual meeting of theRadiological Society of North America (RSNA) In which they demonstrated that caffeine modulates short-term working memory. Some cognitive performance tests of simple reaction time, choice reaction time, incidental verbal memory, and visuo spatial reasoning, have shown that participants who regularly drank coffee were found to perform better on all tests.<query> does coffee help short term memory</query> Roasted coffee contains antioxidant, which in turn contain the anti-cancer compound methylpyridinium. Coffee also increases your energy level after you drink it. But it is a temporary hike. Caffeine can stimulates the central nervous system for a few hours. Bottom-line: Both, sugar-free coffee and green tea come with their own benefits. Each benefit kicks in only for a few hours, whether it is increased metabolism or migraine relief. Thus, both beverages are good - but in controlled measures. Research suggests that coffee and green tea are good in doses of maximum three cups a day. Therefore, if one uses them as substitutes for unhealthy beverages, they - each - benefit you. Remember, that no single beverage can keep you away from disease and weight gain. If you rely on green tea for weight management without eating healthy and exercising, even eight cups won't help you.<query> what is the difference between coffee and green tea</query> Therefore, pick the beverage you prefer based on taste as this will help you develop a lifelong habit, and stick to overall healthy lfiestyle guidelines.

Tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world, surpassed only by water. An often-surprising fact to tea novices is that all teas (white, green, oolong, black and pu'erh) come from the same plant. The botanical name of this versatile plant is Camellia sinensis. Camellia sinensis is a sub-tropical evergreen plant native to Asia but now grown around the world. The tea plant grows best in loose, deep soil, at high altitudes, and in sub-tropical climates. So, in short, ""tea"" is anything derived from the Camellia sinensis plant.<query> what is tea</query> Anything else, while sometimes called ""tea"", is more accurately referred to as an herbal tea or tisane. Tisanes include chamomile, Rooibos and fruit teas. How is it grown? The tea plant, which grows in the wild in some parts of Asia, is cultivated in a variety of settings from small family gardens to giant estates covering thousands of acres. The best tea is usually grown at elevation, and often, on steep slopes. The terrain requires that these premium teas be hand-plucked. Many of the teas that are grown for tea bags or iced teas, on the other hand, are grown on large, flat, lowland areas to allow for machine harvesting. Teas that are processed in the traditional fashion are called Orthodox teas. Orthodox teas generally contain only the top two tender leaves and an unopened leaf bud, which are plucked carefully by hand.<query> where is tea grown</query> Most Orthodox tea production these days involves a unique combination of age-old methods, such as bamboo trays to allow the leaves to wither on, and modern, innovative machinery, like leaf rollers carefully calibrated to mimic motions originally done by hand. A true art form, the tea leaves are handled by artisans with years (often, generations) of training. The other way of making tea is the Unorthodox method, of which the most common type is CTC (crush-tear-curl). This much faster style of production was specifically created for black tea. For commercial production, large machine harvesters are used to ""mow"" the top of the bushes to get the new leaves, rather than hand-pluck. CTC production uses a leaf shredder that macerates the leaves (crushing, tearing and curling them, hence the name) into fine pieces, then rolls them into little balls.<query> what is the process of making tea</query> These teas will brew very quickly and produce and a bold, powerful cup of tea. CTC is usually used primarily in the tea bag industry, as well as in India to create Masala Chai blends (due to their strength and color). What is in tea? The three primary components of brewed tea (also called the ""liquor"") are: 1. Essential Oils - these provide tea's delicious aromas and flavors. 2. Polyphenols - these provide the ""briskness"" or astringency in the mouth and are the components that also carry most of the health benefits of tea. 3. Caffeine - found naturally in coffee, chocolate, tea and Yerba Mate, caffeine provides tea's natural energy boost. How the leaves are processed will determine their final classification as white, green, oolong, etc.<query> what is the main ingredient in tea</query> Although tea is one of the most enjoyed beverages worldwide, its culture can be very ""local."" For example, most tea drinkers in Darjeeling, India have never had (or even heard of!) a Taiwanese Pouchong. In China, most people do not drink black tea. The centuries-old Japanese tea ceremony uses powdered, rare Matcha tea, which most folks in black tea-loving Sri Lanka have never tasted. Tea is a truly special, uniting thing when you think of how so many tea-drinking cultures developed all on their own. America's own newly found tea culture is unique because we actually enjoy all types of tea.

A lot of TVs are not suitable to mount so close to the wall as this bracket is because they need to vent heat. If that's the case with your plasma then you may be better off with our TILT version, as it sits slightly further away from the wall. As with all wall brackets it is essential that this bracket is fixed to timber studs when mounting on plaster board walls. Check out our stud finder below. Please Note: Some panels require M6 16mm bolts which are not included.

It's pretty easy to work out if this bracket will fit your particular screen: 1. First just measure your screen, the bracket is 650mm wide and the arm height is 420mm so as long as the outside of the TV is wider and taller than that, the bracket will not be visible from in front of the TV. 2. Check the mounting holes on the back of the screen and measure how far apart they are. This bracket will fit screens with mounting holes a maximum of 620mm wide and 400mm high (centre of hole to centre of hole). Selby's New & Improved Better Value Bracket This bracket is new to Selby for our 2012 range and features several improvements over most slimline tilt brackets.<query> what size bracket for tv</query> For example, some slimline tilt brackets slowly tilt forwards due to the strain of supporting large TVs, but this bracket features a stronger tilt mechanism which prevents slippage. This bracket also allows you to tilt the screen both downwards AND upwards, which helps with connecting cables. Slimline brackets allow your TV to sit very close to the wall, but that usually makes it very difficult to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV. Being able to tilt the screen upwards can provide you with much easier access to your TV's connections. Designed for Australian Homes This range of brackets is designed to suit the stud spacings of Australian homes. This PLB131L fits perfectly across two 600mm-spaced studs (Australian standard). Slimline Bracket for Thin TVs This is a slimline bracket which sits closer to the wall than most other tilting brackets.<query> what is the tilt bracket for tv</query> It is designed for use with the ultra slim LED screens, but is also suitable for use with LCDs and Plasmas. Please note that some manufacturers recommend that LCDs and plasmas are not to be mounted within a certain distance from the wall, due to heat and ventilation concerns. If unsure, check your user manual or contact the manufacturer. Vertical Tilting Action This bracket offers a +/- 15 degree tilt. Perfect if you wish to mount your TV high on the wall and tilt it down, for example in the bedroom (or in the presence of curious young children with sticky hands!). Downwards tilt can also help to avoid getting annoying reflections on the screen, while upwards tilt makes it much easier to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV. Features: - Low profile ""slimline"" design - Easily adjustable - +/- 15 degrees vertical tilt - Free 2m HDMI cable (v1.4) - Free clip-on bubble level Free HDMI Cable and Bubble Level<query> what is vertical tilt</query> This bracket includes a free 2 metre v1.4 HDMI cable (High Speed with Ethernet) and a clip-on bubble level / spirit level to assist with accurate installation of the bracket. Specifications: - Vertical Tilt: +/- 15 degrees - Distance from wall: 50mm - Maximum weight capacity: 60kg - Total width of bracket: 650mm - Total height of bracket: 420mm - Maximum mounting hole spacing (horizontal): 620mm - Maximum mounting hole spacing (vertical): 400mm - Suits VESA standards up to 600x400mm Screws and Bolts Included This bracket includes a variety of screws and bolts which are suitable for attaching the bracket to the wall and also attaching the bracket tomost TVs. Some screens require screws other than those which we provide.

It seems like just yesterday that they were announcing the release of NetBeans 6.8 (6-7 months ago, actually). Now you can get your final release of NetBeans 6.9 today and experience the wonders of OSGi integration and proper JavaFX tooling. Those are just some of the awesome features in the latest release of Oracle's open source development platform. Here is a shortlist of some of the hottest new features for developers in NetBeans 6.9.<query> what is netbeans 6.9</query> OSGi Integration: This is the biggest change for the NetBeans platform. Eclipse has had an OSGi infrastructure for years. IntelliJ IDEA has one too. Now NetBeans has joined the party. In 6.9 you can convert NetBeans modules into OSGI bundles, import bundles into your application, and create them in your application. Then you can run them in an unmodified OSGi container. What this means is that OSGi and Swing (the standard UI toolkit) are supported simultaneously in the same framework for the first time. NetBeans 6.9 can also use OSGi bundles in a NetBeans RCP application. Developers can make OSGi bundles with Maven or have a bundled Apache Felix container. JavaFX Composer: Still lamenting the lack of quality JavaFX tooling? Well lament no more! The relatively new JavaFX Composer is a visual layout tool for building JavaFX GUI applications. You can liken it to the Swing GUI builder (Matisse) for Java. Composer has form-like UI components with states and access to various data sources. The project developers have added and enhanced editor hints, refactoring, and palettes for JavaFX Shapes, Colors, Effects, and Charts. Click for full screenshot Complete Set of NetBeans Platform Samples: 6.9 comes with a set of complete samples, unlike previous versions, which had only a few samples like the standard Feed Reader or Paint sample. Now NetBeans comes with a broad array of valuable samples for business applications including: CRUD REST client Felix integration Equinox integration and more Separated Lookup API: The Lookup API has been the most frequently used API in NetBeans. In response to its popularity, NetBeans developers have taken it out of the Utilities API collection and given the API its own module. This is going to be a much more convenient place for the key NetBeans API, which ought to be more easily findable.<query> what is netbeans osgi</query> Other significant new features: Felix 2.0.3 OSGi support, experimental Equinox support NetBeans Platform-based applications generate installers for most common operating systems Enhanced support for consuming web applications and connecting to databases Improved code formatting Support for Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) (JSR-299) Spring Framework 3.0 support JavaFX 1.3 support Bundled GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.0.1 Easy regeneration of JPA entities after database change REST web services support for RCP applications Java Debugger breakpoint grouping, debugger attach parameter history Support for annotation processors in the editor, configurable in the Project Properties New Applet and Web Start (JNLP) support Improved navigation in Stack Trace Analyzer and URLs, Go To Overridden/Implemented Method action Refactoring and find usages for CSS and HTML-like languages Code completion and hyperlinking for id and class selector attributes Refactoring inline CSS styles PHP Zend Framework support New PHP formatter with many formatting rules Ruby on Rails 3.0 support Unit test integration with C/C++ projects Enhanced C/C++ remote development including remote file download and browsing Improved support of makefile targets and Fortran For the free 6.9 download and all the extra info you could possibly want, visitNetBeans.org.<query> what is netbeans osgi</query> For getting started with NetBeans, consider theNetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide is a great resource that ties walks you through the NetBeans Platform coherently, showing you how to build an application from scratch; highlighting the most important APIs and features.

clueweb12-0808wb-91-15555,36,1,"In your NetBeans Platform Application project you just need to locate the platform.properties file and replace the line specifying your platform which usually is: nbplatform.active=default with this: suite.dir=${basedir} nbplatform.active.dir=${suite.dir}/netbeans701 harness.dir=${nbplatform.active.dir}/harness bootstrap.url=http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/netbeans/harness/tasks.jar autoupdate.catalog.url=http://updates.netbeans.org/netbeans/updates/7.0.1/uc/final/distribution/catalog.xml.gz If you do a clean and build ANT will download the platform automatically. Registration and Layers In an attempt to convert most of the layer based registry to Annotations and AnnotationProcessors, the registration of File Templates has now been changed. The new Annotation@TemplateRegistration can be used for that. Many of you will probably remember the build warning that the use of an empty layer is highly inefficient. :-).<query> what is the platform.properties file</query> Now the main reason for this, the checkbox in the Module Project Wizard has been removed. If you still need to register something in the layer, and you're too lazy to write your own AnnotationProcessor, or can't use one for other reasons (there are some corner cases where Annotations won't work), there's now a wizard for creating a layer. And as another enhancement to the registry, the ""this layer in context"" UI for investigateing and manipulating the layer file has been fixed to work as expected for Maven based projects, the IDE will download the required JARs from the repository when needed, without the need to a build the suite. Conclusion The NetBeans Platform has received some very useful updates. Primarily, the Window System, which was one of the best on the market before, and at least the best free one, has been further enhanced.<query> what is the netbeans platform</query> What I really like is that also the tooling has become better.

View Full User Profile NetBeans IDE 7.1 Review: NetBeans Platform Support 01.24.2012 Email Views: 6582 Tweet NetBeans IDE 7.1 adds JavaFX 2.0 Support (see my review of that) and a lot of new features and improvements including improvements to the NetBeans Platform itself. The NetBeans Platform is an application framework that can be used as a stable basis for mostly Java desktop applications. (Dozens of screenshots of applications using this frameworkcan be found here.) In this article, I'll focus on the changes to the NetBeans Platform in its newest release, i.e., NetBeans Platform 7.1. Window System The NetBeans Platform features a very powerful Window Management System, letting you declaratively define default window positions, resizing anddocking/undocking windows, minimize/maximize, persist window state, group behavior, etc.<query> what is netbeans platform</query> Version 7.1 introduces a couple of new features here. You can see them in the IDE and reuse them in your NetBeans Platform applications. The reason for the recent improvements is that the NetBeans team apparently has joined forces with the designers ofanother IDE , planning to reuse the NetBeans window system. From the press release: The community working on NetBeans project is proud to announce the availability of new, improved and most flexible version of its window system - the docking framework behind the IDEs, as well as many other NetBeans Platform based applications. By joining forces of the teams working on the design of two large IDEs, we managed to marry the expertise, excellence and creativity of human interface designers, artists, look & feel experts, developers and architects to form a window system ready for the 21st century.<query> what is netbeans platform</query> http://wiki.netbeans.org/WinSys71PressRelease Note that the carefully crafted message above avoids to spell out the other IDE's name! Since it seems to not be very public information yet, I'll leave it to the dear reader to speculate. :-) The ""other IDE"" obviously missed some features in the NetBeans Platform window system. So they had to be introduced here before the ""other IDE"" could adopt the NetBeans Platform. Perspectives The most important enhancement seems to be ""Perspectives "", which are named ""Roles"" here as a way of switching betweenwindow layouts. When registering a window you can now add one or more roles to it in the Annotation, e.g.: @TopComponent.Registration(mode = ""editor"", openAtStartup = true, role=""admin"") To switch perspectives programmatically you only need to call the Window Manager: WindowManager.getDefault().setRole(""user""); In case you want to pick a Role during startup, there's also a new Listener interface you can use calledWindowSystemListener which will receive events during the window system lifecycle (beforeLoad, afterLoad, beforeSave, afterSave).<query> what is perspective</query> A very handy improvement over the existing system. For more details and a complete example have a look atGeertjan's blog post . Window Layout Designer One extremely useful new feature is the new Window Layout Designer allowing you to create new Layouts via drag and drop. You can invoke this functionality using the new ""Layout of Windows"" wizard . The Wizard will launch your application in a special mode, and allow you to create or change Window Positions, aka ""Modes"" and save the changes to a layer file and the files required for defining new Modes. Image 1: Application started in Design Mode If you've ever tried to create your own Mode, you'll find this feature extremely helpful! Image 2: Automatically created Mode definitions Window Group Behaviour The docking system allows you to undock/dock single Windows.<query> how to create a new window layout</query> In NetBeans Platform 7.1 you can now do the same with a whole docking area. So you can now easily undock a group of Windows. This functionality is available from the context menu of the Window. Image 3: A minimized Window Group That's nice, but the second option, using a drag gesture for this is more intuitive and useful. The same improvement has been added formoving a whole docking area or Window Group to a new position. You can simply drag and drop it there, whilevisual guidelines will help you direct the reordering. Pluggable MultiViews In case you're using the MultiView API, there's a very interesting enhancement. You can now register a MultiView for an existing MimeType. It will be available from MimeLookup and can be located by MultiViews.createCloneableMultiView, a factory method that creates a multiview for a given mime type.<query> how to undock a group of windows</query> So any existingMultiView Editor registered for a MimeType automatically has an extension point and can be enhanced. Image 4: A custom multiview tab in the standard Java Editor Again Geertjan has a blog entry with a sample for this new functionality. SaveCookie Replacement Up to Version 7.1 the System for tracking savable changes in TopComponents was based on the DataSystems API. In order to activate the save Button, a TopComponent was basically forced to be backed by a DataObject and a File. This was in the way of reuse. You couldn't easily plug things like database changes into such a system and caused some issues with the displayName.7.1 introduces Saveable as a replacement for SaveCookie and AbstractSaveable to help you implement it. Visual Debugger I already described this in my review of the JavaFX support. NetBeans IDE 7.1 has a visual debugger allowing you to take UI snapshots and examine them in the IDE.<query> what is savecookie</query> This feature also works for NetBeans Platform applications. Even when you open multiple windows and undock some of them the it works as expected. The undocked windows will be saved as a separate snapshot in the Editor and you can dig through the component hierarchy, check registered listeners and even attach special Event logging Listeners. I guess that alone should be investigated in an article of it's own. I'm really deeply impressed with this feature. Configurable Cache Directory One thing we often had problems with during our trainings at universities and conferences was the performance of the IDE and NetBeans Platform when the cache dir is on a slow network drive. With the new command line switch "" --cachedir"", you can override the default location. It has a nice impact on performance if the cache dir is on a fast local disk. Downloadable NetBeans Platform for ANT builds NetBeans Platform really has one nice benefit over it's main competitor Eclipse RCP, and that is the use of standard build systems.<query> what is the default location for the netbeans platform</query> With NetBeans and Maven setting up a continuous build is a click in a context menu, in Eclipse this is a topic of advanced RCP trainings. One other nice benefit of Maven is the ability to define which platform should be used in an application. This way there's a clearly defined Version hosted in a repository that all developers use. With ANT it has often been a hassle to really configure everything correctly, so every developer works with the same APIs, and depending on the setup, a single developer updating the IDE could break the build for all team members by setting a module dependency after the update. So you had to be careful what you do and setup policies for which platform to use, e.g. by putting it under version control. With 7.1 the build harness has been updated to support downloading a specified version of the platform as part of the build process. It's actually very simple.<query> what is the benefit of maven</query>"

I’m waiting for the JDBC version capabilities so I can connect to a non MySQL Server (specifically Oracle). In reading the docs, I see that the syntax includes a CONNECTION String. CREATE TABLE federated_table ( id INT(20)<query> what is the syntax for federated table</query> NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', other INT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX name (name), INDEX other_key (other) ) ENGINE=FEDERATED DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 CONNECTION='mysql://root@remote_host:9306/federated/test_table'; I’m surprised in the state of the syntax for two reasons. First, there are hardcoded variables in the string, this sort of breaks the rules of seperating syntax from authentication specifics Second, if you have multiple FEDERATED tables, you incur a level of duplication of this information, and then multiple necessary changes if the connection string is modified I can’t ask I’d like to see the following, as I don’t use this syntax, but I’d like to suggest a level of abstraction of this information.<query> what is the syntax for federated table</query> Could the CONNECTION point to a referenced object (e.g. CONNECTION=’HOST1′). This would solve my second point. Now, the requirements of the HOST1 object needs to contain a connection string, and where would this be stored. I don’t have an answer for that one. Perhaps somebody else could make a suggestion? Updated Thanks Mike for your comment, click on comments below to read. Boy it’s been been a long time since I read any ISO Standards documents. Just to clarify Mike’s point for those investigative types. SQL/MED is Management of External Data, and the official ISO document is I believe: ISO/IEC 9075-9:2003 Information technology – Database Languages – SQL – Part 9: Management of External Data (SQL/MED) ISO Reference Abstract ISO/IEC 9075 defines the SQL language.<query> what is sql/med</query> The scope of the SQL language is the definition of data structure and the operations on data stored in that structure. Parts 1, 2 and 11 encompass the minimum requirements of the language. Others parts define extensions. ISO/IEC 9075-9:2003 defines extensions to SQL to support management of external data through the use of foreign-data wrappers and datalink types. This document makes reference to DATALINK, a syntax I remember vaguely from Oracle Days. Will need to vett that. What’s also of note in this document is the reference to using the TABLE TYPE of ‘FOREIGN’. I wonder why MySQL went with FEDERATED as the TABLE TYPE. I’m sure this is a good reason? Posted in Databases, General, MySQL, Open Source | No Comments » Brisbane MySQL Users Group Meeting with Brian Aker Saturday, February 4th, 2006 We had the privilege of Brian Aker Director of Architecture for MySQL speaking at theBrisbane MySQL Users Group this week (28 th Jan 2006).<query> what is the scope of sql</query> After the initial discussions on various topics, Brian got into his discussion onMySQL 5.1 . I was surprised that only 2 people (myself being one of them) had 5.1 installed and being used in any way. Here were some of the highlights of the talk. Should have taken some more notes. MySQL 5.1 Features Partitioning Will include Range, Hash, List and Key handling and Subpartitioning. Documentation · Forum. Partitioning is a table structure syntax. No changes to any SQL statements are required to use partitioning within your application. Log Tables Log files can be stored within the database. Error log will definitely not be available. Official information is sketchy. The 5.1.6 Release notes indicate mysqld -both-log-formats and –old-log-format arguments (as of 5.1.6), but nothing yet in theThe MySQL Log Files Documentation Fast Alter Table To speed up Alter Table for example extending a VARCHAR column, only the tables.frm is rewritten, and no adjustment to table rows is required.<query> what is partitioning in mysql</query> Replication Documentation Row Based Replication (RBR) (5.1.5) Documentation mysqld arguments –binlog-format and –binlog-row-event-max-size Support for Cluster (NDB) GUID’s support There was a good discussion on Master/Master including comparision to PostgreSQL. This could be achieved now using triggers and federated tables, or UDF’s. Planned in 5.2 is a Conflict Resolution implementation via use of Stored Procedures, which will be a pre-requisite before any MySQL multi-master implementation. Federated Documentation · Forum Transaction Support (still with some rollback issues) Note: Documentation still lists this as a limitation 5.2 will provide full XA support XML Parsing Support (5.1.5) Article Provides support for XPath expressions in XML content stored in a database column. Events (5.1.6 – not yet available) Article There was a strong discussion on occurance management of events.<query> what is row based replication in mysql</query> Obviously the ability not to have cron jobs, username/passwords etc is great, but with most scripts there is always an amount of locking management (either via filesystem or database). I think we may have convinced Brian to consider a event syntax extension that would ensure that only one instance of a given event can run at any one time. As events are seperate threads it’s important that for frequently run events, there is appropiate management to ensure re-occuring events don’t back up. My opinion is for a syntax to run only one instance of the event (e.g. SINGLE INSTANCE, SINGLE OCCURANCE) We could have recommended BRISBANE as the syntax extension, however I doubt it would be considered standard.

I am available for MySQL consulting and contract opportunities. Archive for February 4th, 2006 Federated Syntax Saturday, February 4th, 2006 I’ve never used Federated. I’m waiting for the JDBC version capabilities so I can connect to a non MySQL Server (specifically Oracle). In reading the docs, I see that the syntax includes a CONNECTION String. CREATE TABLE federated_table ( id INT(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL DEFAULT '', other INT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0', PRIMARY KEY (id), INDEX name (name), INDEX other_key (other) ) ENGINE=FEDERATED DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 CONNECTION='mysql://root@remote_host:9306/federated/test_table'; I’m surprised in the state of the syntax for two reasons.<query> what is the syntax for federated table</query> Posted in Databases, General, MySQL, Open Source | No Comments » You are currently browsing the MySQL Expert | MySQL Performance | MySQL Consulting blog archives for the day Saturday, February 4th, 2006. « Jan Mar » February 2006 M T W T F S S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 EC Categories app engine (3) Data (2) Visualization (2) Professional (888) 42SQL (3) Apple (23) iPhone (14) MacBook (6) OS/X (3) Benchmarking (3) Benchmarking (1) Best Practices (1) Clever Design (7) Cloud Computing (6) 10gen (1) 10gen (1) AppNexus (1) Kaavo (1) Kloudshare (1) Mosso (1)<query> when is mysql open source</query> First, there are hardcoded variables in the string, this sort of breaks the rules of seperating syntax from authentication specifics Second, if you have multiple FEDERATED tables, you incur a level of duplication of this information, and then multiple necessary changes if the connection string is modified I can’t ask I’d like to see the following, as I don’t use this syntax, but I’d like to suggest a level of abstraction of this information. Could the CONNECTION point to a referenced object (e.g. CONNECTION=’HOST1′). This would solve my second point. Now, the requirements of the HOST1 object needs to contain a connection string, and where would this be stored. I don’t have an answer for that one. Perhaps somebody else could make a suggestion? Updated Thanks Mike for your comment, click on comments below to read.<query> what is the connection string</query> Boy it’s been been a long time since I read any ISO Standards documents. Just to clarify Mike’s point for those investigative types. SQL/MED is Management of External Data, and the official ISO document is I believe: ISO/IEC 9075-9:2003 Information technology – Database Languages – SQL – Part 9: Management of External Data (SQL/MED) ISO Reference Abstract ISO/IEC 9075 defines the SQL language. The scope of the SQL language is the definition of data structure and the operations on data stored in that structure. Parts 1, 2 and 11 encompass the minimum requirements of the language. Others parts define extensions. ISO/IEC 9075-9:2003 defines extensions to SQL to support management of external data through the use of foreign-data wrappers and datalink types.<query> what is sql/med</query> This document makes reference to DATALINK, a syntax I remember vaguely from Oracle Days. Will need to vett that. What’s also of note in this document is the reference to using the TABLE TYPE of ‘FOREIGN’. I wonder why MySQL went with FEDERATED as the TABLE TYPE. I’m sure this is a good reason? Posted in Databases, General, MySQL, Open Source | No Comments » Brisbane MySQL Users Group Meeting with Brian Aker Saturday, February 4th, 2006 We had the privilege of Brian Aker Director of Architecture for MySQL speaking at theBrisbane MySQL Users Group this week (28 th Jan 2006). After the initial discussions on various topics, Brian got into his discussion onMySQL 5.1 . I was surprised that only 2 people (myself being one of them) had 5.1 installed and being used in any way.<query> what is table type in mysql</query> Here were some of the highlights of the talk. Should have taken some more notes. MySQL 5.1 Features Partitioning Will include Range, Hash, List and Key handling and Subpartitioning. Documentation · Forum. Partitioning is a table structure syntax. No changes to any SQL statements are required to use partitioning within your application. Log Tables Log files can be stored within the database. Error log will definitely not be available. Official information is sketchy. The 5.1.6 Release notes indicate mysqld -both-log-formats and –old-log-format arguments (as of 5.1.6), but nothing yet in theThe MySQL Log Files Documentation Fast Alter Table To speed up Alter Table for example extending a VARCHAR column, only the tables.frm is rewritten, and no adjustment to table rows is required. Replication Documentation Row Based Replication (RBR) (5.1.5) Documentation mysqld arguments –binlog-format and –binlog-row-event-max-size Support for Cluster (NDB) GUID’s support There was a good discussion on Master/Master including comparision to PostgreSQL.<query> what is partitioning in mysql</query> This could be achieved now using triggers and federated tables, or UDF’s. Planned in 5.2 is a Conflict Resolution implementation via use of Stored Procedures, which will be a pre-requisite before any MySQL multi-master implementation. Federated Documentation · Forum Transaction Support (still with some rollback issues) Note: Documentation still lists this as a limitation 5.2 will provide full XA support XML Parsing Support (5.1.5) Article Provides support for XPath expressions in XML content stored in a database column. Events (5.1.6 – not yet available) Article There was a strong discussion on occurance management of events. Obviously the ability not to have cron jobs, username/passwords etc is great, but with most scripts there is always an amount of locking management (either via filesystem or database). I think we may have convinced Brian to consider a event syntax extension that would ensure that only one instance of a given event can run at any one time.<query> what is the federated documentation in mysql</query> As events are seperate threads it’s important that for frequently run events, there is appropiate management to ensure re-occuring events don’t back up. My opinion is for a syntax to run only one instance of the event (e.g. SINGLE INSTANCE, SINGLE OCCURANCE) We could have recommended BRISBANE as the syntax extension, however I doubt it would be considered standard. Also discussed was appropiate TimeZone management, particularly to ensure events scheduled appropiately across databases managed globally. Loadable Engines This feature may be deferred to 5.2 to have a full feature. The goal of Loadable engines allows for no need to recompile MySQL from source, of even restart an instance for any change to the engine. I’m sure internally the one reason why this is important is to allow ease of testing when writing a new storage engine. Documentation – Writing a Custom Storage Engine · Article Cluster improvements (NDB) Documentation · RoadMap replication works with cluster storage on disk based records, not limited to RAM indexes still remain in RAM Benchmarking Tool mysqlslap (5.1.4) Documentation.<query> why is loadable engine important</query> The list of options looks impressive, and since my 5.1 version is 5.1.4 I’ll be playing some more here. Archive Storage Engine Documentation · Forum auto increment support (5.1.6) Blob Speed Improvements Instance Manager Available in 5.0, but being better published in 5.1 is an Instance Manager allowing change of configuration/startup/shutdown etc. Documentation Distribution Names As part of 5.1, the use of -standard and -max versions will be eliminated. Brian mentioned he had lost count answering the question of the difference between -max and maxDB. As at 5.1.4 (what I have) the filenames still include -max, but we were assured this would be dropped. INFORMATION_SCHEMA Of course as part of these changes, there will be a number of new tables in theINFORMATION_SCHEMA including ENGINES (5.1.5), PLUGINS (5.1.5), PARTITIONS (5.1.6), EVENTS (5.1.6).<query> what is the difference between max and standard blob speed</query> Of note, there is aFILES (5.1.6) for the storage of table information? Other References What’s New in MySQL 5.1 MySQL Change History for Version 5.1 Future Directions for MySQL This year will also be a GUI Enterprise Manager for the community edition FULLTEXT for other storage engines More Transaction Engines Federate Tables to non MySQL tables via JDBC FULLTEXT loadable parser written in C Alternative stored procedure languages Replication Conflict Resolution Management by user definable stored procedures myforge – A soureforge/freshmeat like open source system for MySQL projects Other Discussions There were a number of post talk discussions. Those of interest to me included running other languages in stored procedures (myPerl/myPhp user contributions available at Brian’s open source sitewww.tangent.org), increasing exposure to ISP’s to offer hosting with MySQL 5.0, including best practice guidelines, and of most discussionAsterisk The Open Source PBX.<query> what is mysql 5.3</query>"

My real problem is that I just don’t like the new little GM pickups and, even though I love the Silverado, I don’t need or want a full-size truck. You guys drive all the new stuff. Any suggestions? Mitch Ruttledge Cleveland, Ohio Aside from the new GM Colorado/Canyon pickups, there are eight candidates in the small-truck field. Here’s a rundown: The 2009 Ford Ranger with the 4.0L V-6 can be set up to tow 6000 pounds and, although you can get a 7-foot bed model, a full-size four-door cab configuration is not available. It can also ride rough compared to others in its class. Mazda’s B-trucks are pretty much the same as the Ranger. Dodge’s 2009 Dakota is larger than most in the category, is the only one to offer a V-8 (4.7L), and can be equipped to tow up to 7050 pounds.<query> what is the largest pickup truck</query> We like it, but it is more of a big truck than a little truck, and it could be more than you want. You should probably take a look at it nonetheless. Mitsubishi’s Raider is a re-badged Dakota, but you can’t get the V-8. Nissan’s 2009 Frontier is a smartly designed truck with good handling in a package that’s not too big, nor too small. Its 4.0L V-6 is peppy, and the Frontier (King Cab 2WD model) can tow up to 6500 pounds. Suzuki is also offering a small pickup — basically a re-skinned Frontier. The 2009 Tacoma from Toyota comes in three different cab configurations, features a quick-revving 4.0L V-6, and is available in Access Cab or Double Cab models that can tow up to 6500 pounds. This is one of our favorites in the class.<query> what is the difference between a toyota tacoma and There’s also the 2009 Honda Ridgeline to consider, it can tow 5000 pounds when equipped with the 3.5L V-6, but it’s sort of a pickup/SUV with a cargo bed and is not very large compared to others in the class. Our best advice: Pick a few you like, test drive them, then make an informed decision. ALUMINUM vs. STEEL TRAILERS I need Trailer Boats to settle a difference of opinion between some of my boating buddies. I say for salt water get an aluminum trailer, some say get a galvanized steel trailer. Which is right? Richard Bower San Leandro, California We asked Trailer Boats Editorial Director Jim Hendricks for his opinion on this letter. He is “the salt guy” in the house—and this is what he had to say. “I was faced with the same decision a while back.<query> what is the difference between aluminum and steel trailers</query> My old steel galvanized tandem trailer—which lasted 17 years—needed to be retired. The manufacturer offered me two choices: a galvanized steel frame trailer for about $7000 or an aluminum tandem trailer for 25 to 30 percent more. Given that I got more than 15 years out of a galvanized trailer, I decided to save some money up front and go this direction. “However, all things being equal, aluminum trailers will last longer in salt water, tend to look nicer in the long run and weigh about 30 percent less than comparably sized galvanized steel trailers. The weight issue is probably the most critical advantage for many trailer boaters, as the lighter aluminum trailer means less strain on your tow vehicle, as well as fuel savings when towing.” IS LONGER BETTER? When looking for a tow vehicle, should I focus on rigs with longer wheelbases?<query> how long does a galvanized trailer last</query> I was told that longer wheelbase vehicles are better tow vehicles. And does a manual transmission always mean a lower tow rating? Patrick Lugo Indianapolis, Indiana Longer wheelbases within a model configuration, for most manufacturers, tend to provide better towing stability. However, longer wheelbases do not normally result in higher tow ratings. The major factors are usually, but not always, powertrain performance and other criteria such as cooling, braking, handling and frame strength. These factors combine to determine maximum trailer weight ratings of a specific vehicle. As to automatic or manual transmissions, tow ratings of vehicles with manual transmissions are usually lower than equivalent vehicles with automatics. While this is not always the case, it is usually the clutch that is the limiting component.

At the same time, we found that doing so requires so much effort that it probably can't be done by a child. These seats also weigh 76 pounds each — enough to probably preclude their removal unless you're desperate. B-List Seating The third-row seats in both the Odyssey and Sienna vans are split 60/40 and fold flat into the floor. When the seats were deployed, we found the Sienna's third-row legroom more accommodating than the Odyssey partially because its second-row seats have a long range of fore/aft adjustability and partially because there's simply more space. Folding these third-row seats into the floor is a very different procedure in each of these vans.<query> what is the difference between a odyssey and a sienn In the Odyssey the act requires a two-handed reach-and-pull technique and significant effort. Even an average-size male has to lean far into the van and pull the seats upright, which is a bit of a balancing act. Still, only about 4 seconds are required to drop one side of the seat into the floor. The Sienna's power-operated third row deploys in 18 seconds, although you have to reach up to the top of the hatch where the button is and then hold it down. It takes just 11 seconds to stow one side of the split seat, and double that time or use both hands if you want both sides stowed. Anyone dealing with children will likely prefer this power-operated feature over the Honda's manual operation, so score one for Toyota. Other back-of-the van observations?<query> how long does it take to pull the third row seat on a toyota Both the Odyssey and the Sienna have a power-operated hatch that opens in about 7 seconds and closes in about 10 seconds, both have 12-volt outlets in the rear cargo area and both offer six grocery bag hooks in the seat-well cargo hold. Practical Matters If you don't like beeps, then stay as far from the 2011 Toyota Sienna as possible. It beeps any time a power-operated door is opened or closed. It beeps when the seats are stowed or deployed. And it beeps should its driver dare to maneuver remotely near anything while parking. There's also a delay when you remotely open its side and hatch doors, as if it's asking, ""Are you sure?"" We were sure every time. Meanwhile, the Sienna's modern interior design is welcome. Large, easy-to-read and intuitively arranged buttons scored points over the Odyssey's older design.<query> what is the difference between a toyota odyssey and Both vans offer an immense amount of interior storage. The Odyssey's dual door pockets seem like an ideal design in a vehicle with such vast interior space and the possibility of carrying so many people and their stuff. The Odyssey also scores for its storage bin in the second-row footwell, a concealed compartment that can keep large items (like a purse) out of sight. But the Sienna fought back with massive glovebox space, something the Odyssey lacks. By virtue of an exterior design that has a lower waistline, the 2010 Honda Odyssey offers better visibility front and rear. Its materials look slightly dated, but they compare well with the Toyota Limited's use of fake wood trim. We doubt it's a coincidence that the small fitment defects we saw in this pre-production Sienna were the same as those we've seen in production Toyotas.<query> what is the difference between honda odyssey and toyota Behind the Wheel Toyota has changed its approach to ride quality in the Sienna compared to the other family-oriented vehicles in its product lineup. It doesn't float down the highway and instead stays settled on the road, and the result inspires far more confidence. But don't get us wrong, there's still a huge emphasis on comfort, something we found agreeable except when rolling across the sort of choppy concrete slabs you find on overused freeways, especially here in California. Despite its long wheelbase, the Sienna's ride is too busy over such surfaces. For all the Sienna's newfound emphasis on driving dynamics, the Honda Odyssey remains the leader when it comes to the way a minivan should drive. Though the Odyssey is massive, it still drives like a car in a way that no other manufacturer can achieve.<query> what is the sienna</query> There's a sublime balance between comfort and just enough control to feel safe and reassured. Honda has nailed the subtleties. Of these two minivans, only the 2011 Toyota Sienna has a gated lever for its six-speed transmission, something that lets you more precisely control engine braking, which is very useful in a vehicle that's likely to be driven while heavily loaded. Performance The Sienna V6's extra 20 ponies turn up in full force in acceleration tests, where Toyota's minivan scoots to 60 mph from a standstill in only 7.9 seconds (7.6 secondswith 1 foot of rollout like on a drag strip). The quarter-mile is also dispatched quickly, some 15.8 seconds at 90.5 mph. This performance is considerably quicker than that of the Odyssey, which requires 8.8 seconds to reach 60 mph (8.5 seconds with 1 foot of rollout like on a drag strip) and goes through the quarter-mile in 16.6 seconds at 84.8 mph.<query> how fast is a toyota sienna</query> The braking distance required to stop from 60 mph is much the same for these two minivans, with the Toyota coming to a stop in 127 feet, some 3 feet shorter than the Odyssey. The real story, however, isn't that the Sienna stopped shorter. Rather, it's that after only four stops the Odyssey's brake pedal went soft and stopping distances began to increase. In fact, the Odyssey's brake pedal action subsequently became so soft that it dramatically compromised effectiveness. If driving on mountain roads is a common experience for you, the Toyota Sienna's braking performance should sway you. What the 2010 Honda Odyssey lacks in straight-line gusto it makes up for through our 600-foot slalom course. Its fastest run of 61.7 mph is 1.1 mph faster than the Sienna, which has a very aggressive calibration for its stability control system.<query> how fast does a honda odyssey go</query> More important, the Honda's conventional hydraulic-assist power steering proves well weighted in its effort level and offers intuitive action and feel, while the Sienna's electric-assist system makes the steering feel numb, particularly off-center where it lacks feedback. Neither van allowed its stability control to be fully disabled — a trait that was most obvious on the skid pad. Here the Toyota's larger 18-inch tires helped it produce 0.77g in lateral acceleration versus the Odyssey's 0.74g performance. Fuel consumption was a virtual wash between the two. Over the course of more than 1,000 miles, the Sienna nudged the Odyssey by an insignificant 0.1 mpg, 20.5 mpg versus 20.6 mpg. You Can't Lose Both these vans are immensely capable and neither exhibits any significant shortcomings. In other words, you'll be making a solid choice with either one.<query> what is the difference between honda odyssey and honda odys But there can only be one winner. And in this case, it's the 2011 Toyota Sienna. There's no arguing with the Sienna Limited's high-value features when one considers the relatively minor $525 premium you'll pay for them. Most of these — like iPod integration, adaptive cruise control and keyless ignition/entry — are just examples of the latest convenience technology and will likely be available on the new 2011 Honda Odyssey next year. The quality of the Sienna's interior isn't as nice as we'd like, but what it lacks in materials quality it more than makes up for in design. Then there's the fact that the 2011 Toyota Sienna has a power advantage over the 2010 Honda Odyssey, yet still matches the Honda's fuel-efficiency. Though it might not be the vehicle of every man's dreams, the 2011 Toyota Sienna is simply the best value in minivans sold today.<query> what is the best minivan</query> At least until next year. The manufacturers provided Edmunds these vehicles for the purposes of evaluation.

A test of utility and usability. A test of family hauling and cargo carrying. A test where practicality overshadows pride. Specifically, it's a comparison test of the 2011 Toyota Sienna and 2010 Honda Odyssey, both vying to be recognized as the warrior queen of the minivan segment. And it's a test any real man should read with honor.<query> what is the difference between a toyota sienna and a This is what adaptive cruise control attempts to accomplish. Dual moonroofs: Often seen as a feature that either reduces headroom or simply adds cost, the Sienna's dual moonroofs actually keep the second and third rows from feeling confined and cavelike. Keyless ignition/entry: Your key never leaves your pocket to enter or start your van. That's convenient, and especially so when you've got a load of groceries in one hand and a kid in the other. Keyless ignition/entry makes this possible. Manual gear selection: Manually selecting gears gives drivers a large measure of control over a vehicle's speed and momentum in situations where a conventional automatic would only look for the next highest gear. It's a subtlety, but an important one. Only the Sienna has it here. Navigation system: Where's the restaurant?<query> what is the sienna</query> The gas station? The hotel? These are the questions a navigation system answers. And even though the navigation system in the Odyssey is dated by modern standards, it's there in the dash, which you can't say of the Sienna. Power-operated third row: Push and hold the button and the third-row seats either disappear into the floor or deploy from it. No pulling, no lifting, no effort. Just waiting. And for many, it's worth the extra cost. Rear-seat entertainment system: This keeps the kids busy and the parents sane. Just ask Clark Griswold. Second-row in-floor storage: The ability to store medium-size cargo in an out-of-sight but still-in-reach spot adds tremendous utility to the Odyssey's design.<query> what is the navigation system on a odyssey</query> True iPod connectivity/Bluetooth music streaming: The ability to control your iPod through the vehicle's audio system is far more useful than relying on a ""dumb"" auxiliary connection. Bluetooth music streaming eliminates the cord altogether.

Real men will acknowledge this, social stigma or not. Both the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey have been winners in our previous Inside Line minivan comparison tests.

This would be our 4th minivan, so we have certain priorities and expectations. We really don't like the new body & interior styling of the 2011 Ody. It seems as though they've tried to make it more appealing to the SUV buyer and it's lost some of the minivan character that we've grown to appreciate. Outward visibility from the drivers seat was simply awful given the higher beltline and thick D pillars. In addition to dealership drives, we've rented both a 2011 Sienna LX (last month) and a 2009 (?)<query> what is the price of a 2011 ody</query> Ody EX from Hertz previously. So this makes it rather awkward for us. Shopping for a new 2011 Sienna against a program car / off lease 2009/2010 used Ody. I know - it doesn't make much sense. The Sienna LX is so aggressively priced that buying a used Ody seems crazy. Yet from an interior comfort and flexibility standpoint, we still see the Ody as the better van. The mid row seats on the Sienna were terribly uncomfortable, the step-in height was higher, and the load floor with seats folded was uneven. Outward visibility on the Sienna was only tolerable thanks to the std backup camera. Our quest continues (yep, we looked at the Nissan, then kept on looking!).

The run-flats for the AWD is the worst idea ever for a minivan -- nobody we called carried the stupid thing. We had to get a regular tire on to get home on time. And one lug nut seemed to have cross-threaded so that it ripped off the screw part. The dealer later replaced that for free, although the guy muttered some BS about, ""This is normally not under warrantee but since it's new we'll replace it for free."" WTF, it's a manufacturing defect!<query> what is the worst idea ever for a minivan</query> Although my sample size is just one, I am unhappy with the corners that Toyota seems to be cutting.

The navigation is horrible, we actually brought our Garmin. The good things are that the transmission responses with reasonable alacrity when you need to pass, even uphill, and ... well, it's overall reasonably functional. Even though I saved about $6k off the MSRP, in retrospect I would have been happier with the XLE, maybe even the LE. This is NOT a $45k vehicle (our MSRP).

For anyone who actually DRIVES their minivan daily, and on trips with real roads (i.e. high speed limits, braking, bad weather, etc.) the idea that the Honda is remotely comparable is laughable. Brakes that start fading after one application at speed? Sounds like our '97 Dodge Caravan, completely unacceptable. The 2010 Honda's styling is similar to the previous gen Sienna, the 2011 is far more updated and attractive. My kids (both under 12) had ZERO problems moving the seats on the long rails.

Mileage so far is about 21 in mixed driving with the AWD (the same route gets me 22 mpg with the G37x, as a comparison). Report ItReport It DLu says: 08:06 PM, 04/25/2010 @ colloquor, Couple of observations... 1. For people who like the room to haul people and cargo, the minivan is a reasonable alternative to SUV's. The Toyota Landcruiser lists for about $60-65k, which is even more ludicrous to me because it has less cargo room (sure, it can go off-road but I don't go off road so it's ludicrous to me). How is $40k for a minivan more ludicrous than $40k for a car/SUV/truck/whatever? Our G37x is $40k and it carries only 4 people and has a tiny trunk, and the keyless access doesn't work nearly as well as the Sienna ... An expensive minvan simply does not allow you to show off your $45k because nobody will ever think that a Sienna can cost as much as a 335i. 2.<query> how much does a minivan cost</query> You must not like the ""bells and whistles"" in any car. Many $40k-plus cars come standard with xenons etc (even the cheaper Mazda3 has it as an option) and they won't break more frequently just because they are in a minivan. It would be quite expensive too if you don't know how to replace a few basic items yourself. Perhaps your point is that minivans are supposed to be utilitarian and practical. Well, a cargo van is even roomier and quite affordable, while many people who buy $50k-plus SUV's ""need"" the practicality of more cargo room. +1 ohfive for being cool-headed. I actually thought I'd never own a Toyota product, only because they make the most boring cars these days (Supra was pretty bad-ass), so I am by no means a Toyota fan. However, it makes me laugh that every time the media hypes up something, people act like it's the first time anyone has come across it. Audi and BMW have had problems with unintended acceleration; Ford had fiascos with exploding gas tanks and SUV's that killed people in combination with Firestone tread separation, etc etc. Driving will ALWAYS be dangerous (kills more young people under age 40 than all other diseases, cancer etc combined), especially if you are not careful and if you don't know how to control your car in emergency situations. Do your homework before you buy a car. If you don't know whether a Sienna had unintended acceleration problems, raise your hand and ask.<query> what is the difference between a minivan and a suv</query> Report ItReport It DLu says: 07:17 PM, 04/25/2010 @ toroger28, Perhaps I am misunderstanding your desire for cigarette lighters, but there are a myriad of 12V and even 120V (for household 2-prong-type plugs) power outlets for your electronics, for the second and third rows. Cigarette lighter-type outlets require an adaptor; with the 2011 (i don't know about the last generation) Siennas, you have both options (and multiples of each!). Test drive one and you'll figure out for yourself if that's good enough. :) Report ItReport It toroger28 says: 04:24 PM, 04/22/2010 It's roomy and comfortable. However, the middle seat of the second row, the seat is feel chessy. The seat is too soft. Also, kind of disappointed that there are no cigarette lighter slot for the second and third rows seat to use. This is a huge problem for us, because when we travel for long distance, the second and third row seat are unable to charge their phones and ipod.<query> what type of outlet do i need for my honda sienna</query> Report ItReport It DLu says: 06:34 AM, 04/09/2010 Just got the Limited (sucker for the dual moonroof and the keyless access/""Smart Key"") AWD with ""premium"" package (they call come with the dang package). The only SUV/Crossover I entertained is the CX09, which has too small of a cargo area behind the 3rd row. Oh, and AWD is nice in NE. I think the ride is surprisingly controlled, like the article says. This thing, compared to the 2004 RX330 AWD (the only other fuddy car I've driven recently) for example, is less like a floating boat. The steering, though overly light, is just a bit more responsive than the RX to be tolerable. BTW, there are practically no 2010 Siennas left around here, so much for the incentives. We got a good deal on the 2011, about 1300 below ""invoice."" I'm happy so far. :) Report It Report It Sort By: Most Recent First Posted of 10 prev next Close Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Preview Comment Edit Comment Post Comment Advertisement Speed Read 1st<query> what is the difference between a 2004 rx330 and a 2010 sienn Meanwhile, the fully redesigned 2011 Toyota Sienna has come to the market with a barrage of features, a new transmission and a kickass, take-no-prisoners attitude. OK, we fabricated that last bit to keep the men reading, but even a glance at the new Sienna makes it obvious that Toyota has Honda directly in its sights. Sorting out which of these minivans is best is the role of our scoring system, which weights the final result according to price (20 percent), fuel consumption (15 percent), feature content (25 percent), a 29-point evaluation by the editors (20 percent), performance (15 percent) and finally editorial preference (5 percent). The Players Both vans in this test are top-of-the-line, front-wheel-drive examples.<query> which minivan is best</query> Place: 2011 Toyota Sienna Feature-laden, thoroughly modern, quicker than the Odyssey and just as efficient, the Sienna makes a winning value statement. 2nd Place: 2010 Honda Odyssey Finally showing its age, although there's still nothing wrong with the solidly built and brilliantly engineered Odyssey.

Among its features are 18-inch tires, keyless ignition/entry, a JBL 10-speaker premium audio system and Toyota's Safety Connect telematics. This particular Limited also came with the $1,800 Limited Convenience package, which adds rain-sensing wipers and high-intensity-discharge headlamps.

In truth, both these vans are as laden with features as most luxury cars. In fact, each carries such a comprehensive list of features that we found it difficult to differentiate one from the other. For example, the list of features common to both includes such elaborate convenience items as triple-zone climate control, power liftgate, back-up camera and sensors, multiadjustable power seats with memory and hands-free Bluetooth connectivity. By the Numbers When it comes to the shadow these two eight-passenger vehicles cast on the pavement, the dimensional differences don't make much of a difference. Surprisingly, the older 2010 Honda Odyssey is the longer overall of the two by 1.9 inches (and here we thought all new cars were getting bigger).<query> what is the difference between a honda odyssey and a When it comes to wheelbase, however, the Sienna's 119.3-inch measurement exceeds the Odyssey's 118.1 inches. And even though it has more features, the Sienna weighs less than the Odyssey, some 4,586 pounds versus 4,612 pounds. If you don't like beeps, then stay as far away from the Toyota as possible. Not that anyone who buys one will care too much, but both the Odyssey and Sienna are powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine. Honda rates its power plant at 244 horsepower at 5,700 rpm and 245 pound-feet of torque at 4,900 rpm, and the Odyssey utilizes a five-speed automatic transmission to put that power to the ground. The Sienna's V6 (a four cylinder is optional) cranks out more power than the Honda with 265 hp at 6,200 rpm and 245 lb-ft of torque at 4,700 rpm.<query> what is the difference between honda odyssey and honda odys A new six-speed automatic with a manual-shift feature is standard for the Sienna. The Seating Showdown Here's where this test is won or lost. It's in these details that the soccer moms of the world decide the fate of the minivan. And it's here where the aging Honda still holds its own. Largely, this is because the Odyssey's interior design has so much space-efficiency and practicality that its utility hasn't been surpassed by any important advances in vehicle architecture. Eight-passenger seating capacity isn't unique to the Odyssey (the Sienna offers it as an option), yet we've found that it offers a small but useful margin of utility for occasional duty. The center seat in the second row is small, but it quickly transforms into a center console with cupholders or can be removed to make pass-through space between the seats.<query> how many passengers does a honda odyssey seat</query> The 2010 Honda Odyssey's lightweight, simple-to-remove second-row seats also offer a measure of utility unavailable in the Sienna Limited. With the center seat/console removed, they can slide together to improve ease of access to the third row through the passenger-side door. They weigh 62 pounds each and can be removed by anybody with a reasonably strong back. In contrast, the 2011 Toyota Sienna Limited comes standard with second-row ""lounge seating,"" which means that its two second-row seats are reclining captain's chairs with footrests that extend. These recliners were comfortable, but you have to be the right size, and any of our editors taller than 5-foot-9 disdained them. If you're a little too big, then you find your shoes resting against the front seatbacks, and if you're really big, your feet just won't fit anywhere at all.<query> what is the difference between a toyota sienna and a"

clueweb12-1413wb-37-25590,42,1,"It seats seven or eight. It's capable for traversing rugged terrain. It can tow more than 7000 pounds. The Sequoia offers full-size truck capability with roomy, comfortable surroundings. John Stewart filed this report to NewCarTestDrive.com from Durham, North Carolina, with G.R. Whale reporting from Los Angeles. Interior Overview Editor: New Car Test Drive Price As Tested: $55,250 “Seating for eight, room for stuff.” The Toyota Sequoia cabin is built for passenger comfort, with generous legroom and headroom. Seating is designed for long days of driving, with a comfortable, broad driver's seat with power lumbar support. The seats have soft, wide bolsters, easy to climb over getting in and out, and the kind of adjustability that allows a driver to shift around during long drives. The SR5's cloth and Platinum's perforated leather each offer two colors, Graphite and Sand Beige, each as bland as they sound; to these the Limited adds Red Rock, a still-muted but more interesting, Southwest-flavored shade suggesting of bricks or red-clay ceramics.<query> how much does a toyota sequoia cost</query> The Sequoia revels in bigness. The interior is conspicuously wide and offers ample legroom and shoulder room. The dash is simple and focused, with two central gauges, speedometer and tachometer, flanked by fuel, temperature and voltage gauges. Bright rings accent the instrumentation. A very large rectangular shifter dominates the metallic center strip area, and behind it is a wide central console designed to hold 12 CDs or four DVD cases. The four-spoke steering wheel contains controls for AC, Bluetooth-capable phones and audio functions, varying by grade. The steering column tilts and telescopes, and it's electrically and memory-linked on Platinum. Switches and dials are used to control windows and the HVAC system. The HVAC system is designed to define and maintain three different climate zones, two in the front, and one in the back.<query> what is the sequoia</query> We think Toyota does a good job when it comes to switch feel and operational consistency of dials and other touch points. Two overhead compartments are suitable for sunglasses, and the control strip has sunroof controls. An electrochromic rear view mirror is standard except on SR5, and the mirror contains built-in garage door opener buttons operating on three different frequencies. If you choose a backup camera without navigation the image is displayed in the mirror. The sun visors are huge, and they slide on their hangers, providing effective shade for driver and passenger all day long. On the A-pillar are hefty grab handles, with grips big enough to support body weight as you swing into the seat. The interior is notable for thoughtful features that increase utility, such as a compass, map light, automatic up-and-down jam protection for front power windows, and back door power window.<query> what is the toyota sr5</query> There are eight cup holders, eight bottle holders, console surfaces, everything you would want for eating in the Sequoia while putting away the miles. And then, there's lots of door pocket space for trash. Second-row seating carries two or three people; it's roomy but not as stretch-out as some other large utilities. The split bench arrangement reclines and slides fore-n-aft, and arguably makes the most sense for a truck like this. Either way, access to the third row is good enough for anyone that fits back there, and that includes adults. The Sequoia is especially designed to make the third-row passenger seats more comfortable, and more useful, more like real seating for adults. To that end, the third-row seats have almost as much leg room as the second-row seats but lose three inches of headroom.<query> what is the seat arrangement on a sequoia</query> For comparison a 1.4-inch-longer Ford Expedition offers at least two inches more legroom and a bit more headroom in the back two rows. However, for those who often make use of the third row, the Sequoia's standard interior layout is better than many SUVs we've seen, in which the third-row seats constitute emergency seating for smaller people only. Those who do not need eight-passenger capacity can configure the Sequoia with captain's chairs in the second row, which shifts the priority to second-row passenger comfort. The Sequoia is one of the very few SUVs with a retractable rear hatch window. It also has a closed, removable ashtray that is dish-washable, and a cigarette lighter up front. Last but not least, the Sequoia has ample cargo room behind the third row, and even more if you fold it down.<query> what is the standard third row seat in a sequoia</query> It offers 120 cubic feet behind the front seats, 67 behind the second row, and 19 behind the third row. The Expedition has roughly the same behind the third row but less otherwise; if you need considerably more you'll be checking into Expedition EL and the Chevy Suburban. When Sequoia's third row is folded flat, large baggage or cargo can be loaded without removing the seat. It is a well-organized cargo area, even having tow hooks that can hang grocery bags. The seat folds flat manually in SR5's, and upgrades to a power folding feature in Limited and Platinum models. Driving Impression Editor: New Car Test Drive Price As Tested: $55,250 “Seating for eight, room for stuff.” We found the Sequoia comfortable for a 1,000-mile day. Driving the Toyota Sequoia is like sitting in your den, watching the world go by.<query> how much space does the sequoia have</query> It may be big, but it's not tiring to operate as the day goes on. It's the kind of vehicle that an American family would enjoy for a long, long day on the interstate. It's got long legs and an effortless cruising pace. There is low noise and vibration, so you can listen to the audio system or converse at a normal tone of voice. It rates 18-19 mpg on the open road, conceivably offering 500 miles between fill-ups at moderate speeds and loads. No doubt about it, the Sequoia is at home on the biggest of North American roads. In everyday driving, the suspension is surprisingly compliant for a vehicle built to carry heavy loads. There is a minimum of tummy jiggle on broken surfaces, and yet, when hard braking is called for, the front end does not dive wildly or pitch about.<query> what is the biggest vehicle in the us</query> The Platinum version has the active air suspension, which has the ability to maintain more even ride height with heavy loads, which we tested and found it works well. In reality there isn't much difference between the suspensions and you'll want a weight-distributing hitch for all but light trailers. The standard setup is an independent A-arm configuration at all four corners, with coil springs and anti-sway bars. The 5.7-liter V8 has lots of power, with an impressive reserve of torque. We loafed along at 2000 rpm or less all day long without feeling the need to punch the throttle. The 5.7-liter makes most of its torque below 3600 rpm, so when you do decide to pass, acceleration is impressive. Like the 4.6 it features four valves per cylinder and variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts, and a low-friction valve train enhances efficiency.<query> what is the difference between a platinum and a 5.3 liter v8</query> The 4.6-liter V8 is not as strong as the 5.7-liter engine, but if you use the 5.7's extra 71 horsepower and 74 lb-ft of torque (which the EPA doesn't) you will use more fuel. And the 4.6 sounds and feels like it's the quieter, smoother choice. The 6-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission accounts for part of the Sequoia's decent highway mileage. The transmission is controlled by a shifter that allows manual shifting, and has a lock-up torque converter for better towing efficiency and heat control. There is a Tow/Haul mode that changes the shift points for heavy loads and gives less hunting or shifting between gears on climbs and better speed control on descents. Four-wheel-drive models come with a two-speed transfer case with 2.6:1 low-range gearing.<query> what is the transmission on a sequoia</query> We found low range easy to get in and out of, even on ground that was not perfectly level. And the gearing seemed low enough that the Sequoia could crawl at speeds slow enough to slog up very steep terrain. When and if a Sequoia gets stuck, it'll likely be lack of tire traction or space for the bodywork, not for a lack of power or gearing. The Sequoia with 5.7-liter can tow up to 7400 pounds but the 4.6 will do just 500 pounds less, so if you're pulling a bass boat across the plains or through rolling landscape the 5.7-liter engine isn't necessary. A seven-pin connector and a standard four-pin connector are set up and ready to use, and there is a pre-wired brake controller connector under the dash, similar to the Tundra.<query> how much does a sequoia tow</query> Customer Testimonials Careers Elgin Toyota Newsletter Subscribe to our newsletter!

The new-for-2012 Trailer Sway Control uses the Sequoia's electronic Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) to keep the keep the truck tracking straight and true, even when a swaying trailer tries to yank it off-course. The limiting factor towing could easily be tongue weight, and the SR5 5.7 allows the highest at 1000 pounds (960 with 4WD). Although the Platinum has air suspension in back to level things it's the heaviest model and maximum tongue weight is 910 pounds (880 with 4WD). Based on that and the 18-inch wheels we'd suggest the SR5 5.7 as the best Sequoia for heavier towing.<query> what is the max weight of a sequoia</query> The brakes are consistent with full-size pickup capability as they should be; the lightest Sequoia weighs more than the heaviest Tundra, and a top-line 4WD Sequoia is more than three tons. Large disc brakes are mounted on all four corners. The brakes feel reasonably gradual; with very strong response as foot pressure is increased. Like some other luxo-utes the Sequoia offers active speed control (Dynamic Laser in Toyota-speak). Such systems monitor the road ahead and adjust your speed on cruise control to maintain a safe following distance, and while marketed as driver-assist like other such systems they are no substitute for paying attention; there is only so much they can do if side-traffic runs a stop or a light, or oncoming traffic drifts out of its lane. In daily use around town, the Sequoia will seem big to those not accustomed to maneuvering full-size domestic iron.<query> what is the toyota sequoia</query> It is however, reasonably maneuverable and needs only 4-5 feet more pavement to make a U-turn than the average sedan. We notice that, like any full-size, the hood is long and tall, and the distance to the rear bumper is not easily estimated without practice. Parking sensors front and rear go a long way toward making the best of the need to fit a big SUV into an average parking space by providing audible warnings when maneuvering in close quarters. The rearview camera that displays a video image of what's behind you on the navigation screen (or a smaller image on the mirror) is even better. We highly recommend getting this optional feature for its safety benefits. A rearview camera, in addition to the audible warnings, can help alert the driver to a child behind the vehicle or, more commonly, unseen objects you don't want to hit.<query> what is the best way to park an suv</query> It also makes the parking process easier and speedier. The camera also helps greatly when hitching a trailer, eliminating the need for trial and error or a spotter. Steering is fingertip-easy around town. It avoids being boat-like by a variable system that adds more return-to-center and a firmer, more precise level of control as speeds increase. At higher speeds, we found the Sequoia easy to keep in its lane without undue attention. While this family SUV is not built to be a cornering machine on country roads, control is good enough for confident handling; the electronic stability control will intervene if you try anything enthusiastic. On a vehicle this big, power windows and doors are more than just luxury options; they become necessities. It's an impossible reach across the cabin, and a long walk to open the tailgate in the rain.<query> what is the steering system on a sequoia</query> The power rear hatch can be opened using the remote fob, handy when approaching the vehicle in a downpour with a load of groceries, but watch overhead clearance in garages. Model Lineup Editor: New Car Test Drive Price As Tested: $55,250 “Seating for eight, room for stuff.” The 2012 Toyota Sequoia SR5 ($40,930) comes with easy-clean cloth upholstery, tri-zone air conditioning; power windows, locks, and back window; power moonroof; eight-way power driver's seat and four-way manual front passenger's seat; 40/20/40 middle row recline/fold-flat seat; 60/40 fold-flat recline third row seat; keyless entry; an eight-speaker AM/FM/CD/SiriusXM audio system with auxiliary jack, USB port for iPod compatibility, and Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming; power heated mirrors; tilt/telescoping steering; cruise control; spare tire; rear spoiler; integrated fog lamps;18-inch alloy wheels and a tow package.<query> toyota sequoia price</query> The SR5 is available with 4WD ($44,155).

The dash is upgraded with brighter Optitron gauges and a multi-information display, and a 14-speaker JBL Synthesis audio system. Outside, the Limited adds chrome trim, 20-inch wheels, power liftgate, and power-folding, self-dimming mirrors with integrated turn signals. The Limited is available with four-wheel drive ($54,265). Options for the Limited include a rear-seat DVD entertainment system ($1,670), second-row bucket seats (no charge), and DVD-based navigation ($1,460). The Platinum ($58,580) is a seven-seater with heated bucket seats and a console in the middle row. It builds on Limited equipment with 20-inch diamond-finish alloy wheels, a rear load-leveling suspension and adaptive shocks, and a memory feature for the mirrors, power-adjustable steering column and power seats, which are heated and air conditioned in the front.<query> what is the price of a honda limited</query> Platinum also gets standard puddle-lamps and reverse-tilt for outside mirrors, navigation/backup camera, active cruise control, rear-seat entertainment, wood-grain trim for steering wheel, doors and shifter. The only choices on Platinum are four-wheel drive ($61,805) or adding pearl white paint ($220). Safety features standard on all models include advanced frontal airbags, front knee airbags, seat-mounted side-impact airbags for the front row, three-row side-curtain airbags with rollover sensor, electronic stability control with trailer sway control, traction control, and daytime running lights. The new-for-2012 Blind Spot Monitor, exclusive to the Platinum model, warns drivers of vehicles traveling in their blind spots. Walk Around Editor: New Car Test Drive Price As Tested: $55,250 “Seating for eight, room for stuff.” The Toyota Sequoia is long and wide, with a long wheelbase, and is designed to look tall and oversized, so as to project strength from a distance.<query> what is the price of a toyota platinum</query> It's every inch a full-size SUV. The Sequoia shares design features with the Tundra pickup from the front bumper to the B-pillar, along with numerous drive train components. The low windshield angle accentuates bulk below the hood line, and large high-mounted headlamps add an alert look to a cabin-forward design. Exterior mirrors are large, because they have to be for towing, but careful smoothing has reduced wind noise, as does the use of partially hidden wipers that likewise must be very large to sweep the windshield. The design has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.36, respectable for a full-size truck, but remember that aerodynamic resistance is Cd times frontal area, so keeping highway speeds moderate will pay off in less fuel consumption for this big box. From the side, large, strong-looking door handles are apparent, the kind you'd appreciate if you wear gloves.<query> what is the drag coefficient of a sequoia</query> All the roof pillars are big as well, and the flare in the bodywork to cover the rear tires makes the area between the wheels look smaller than it is. The rear doors open wide, for easy child seat and passenger access. Parking sensors and a pair of rear camera display choices enable easier parking and the ability to avoid people or toys lurking in the driveway. The receiver hitch is well incorporated in the rear bumper, and the bumper has decent low-slip top for loading the roof rack. To avoid damage from shopping carts or narrow tree-lined forest trails the taillights are up high and the rear reflectors are inset in the bumper where they get dirty quickly.

Toyota's STAR system, a comprehensive combination of electronic safety, stability and traction controls, is standard on all models, as are eight airbags. Properly equipped, Sequoia is rated to tow up to 7,400 pounds. The 2012 Sequoia offers two engines. The standard 4.6-liter V8 is rated at 310 horsepower and 327 pound-feet of torque and an EPA-estimated 14/20 mpg City/Highway. Sequoia Limited and Platinum models come with a 5.7-liter V8 rated at 381 hp and 401 lb-ft of torque and an EPA-estimated 13/18 mpg City/Highway. Both come with a 6-speed automatic. With four-wheel drive, it's 13/18 mpg for the 4.6-liter, 13/17 mpg for the 5.7-liter.<query> how much does a sequoia weigh</query> A flex-fuel version of the 5.7-liter engine is available for burning inefficient E85 (85 percent ethanol, 15 percent gasoline), dropping fuel economy to a dismal 9/13 mpg City/Highway with E85 or 13/17 mpg with gasoline. We recommend the 4.6-liter. It's plenty, unless you have a trailer to tow, in which case we recommend the 5.7-liter. The Toyota Sequoia was completely redesigned for 2008. The base engine got a boost in both power and efficiency for 2010. Changes since then have been confined to options and trim levels. For 2012, Sequoia Platinum models come with a blind-spot monitor, and all 2012 Sequoia models now include the Tundra's Trailer Sway Control (TSC). This second-generation Sequoia borrows heavily in appearance from the Toyota Tundra, looking very much like the pickup from the front.<query> what is the engine in a toyota sequoia</query> Sequoia uses much of the Tundra's running gear, but with an independent rear suspension for better ride quality and room for third-row seating. The Sequoia represents a modern take on the traditional sport utility vehicle. It's big, built to transport people and their gear in comfort across long distances on North American super-highways. It can tow a sizable trailer or continue when the pavement ends and many other SUVs don't look so tough anymore. It's all about getting people in and out easily, keeping them comfy, and making heavy loads secure and routine. It rides quietly, steers easily, and with three models, two drivetrains, and a full complement of features, the Sequoia can meet a variety of wants, needs and price points. We think the Sequoia SR5 is the best model in the lineup for towing, with or without four-wheel drive.<query> what is the sequoia</query> In Toyota's SUV lineup, the Land Cruiser is a more upscale luxury vehicle than the Sequoia and offers greater off-road capability and towing capacity. Conversely, the smaller Highlander SUV and Sienna minivan offer similar features to the Sequoia, drive more like cars and use much less fuel due to their lighter weight and smaller engines. Summary Editor: New Car Test Drive Price As Tested: $55,250 “Seating for eight, room for stuff.” The Toyota Sequoia is for big loads, big roads and wide open spaces. There is ample power in reserve for towing and hauling, and a roomy, comfortable interior. There are so many small, thoughtful touches, we get the sense that the Sequoia is one of those SUVs an owner would grow to appreciate more and more as time goes on.<query> what is the price of a toyota sequoia</query>"

The Friction-Free Economy offers up some entertaining, if not enlightening, notions November 1997 Abstract What are the forces that govern today's high-tech marketplace? Forget about those economic theories you learned in school: Adams, or Keynes, or even Karl Marx have no place in Silicon Valley, according to T.G. Lewis. He tries to answer this question in his new book,The Friction-Free Economy: Marketing Strategies for a Wired World (2,600 words). Mail this article to a friend n his book The Road Ahead, Bill Gates made a statement that I found so apt that it appears in my standard marketing presentation on electronic commerce: ""[The Internet] will carry us into a new world of low-friction, low-overhead capitalism, in which market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low."" That phrase sums up the essence of T.G. Lewis's breezy, slapdash book,The Friction-Free Economy: Marketing Strategies for a Wired World.<query> how has the internet changed the rules on business and economics?</query> The Internet/intranet market contains many factors, including all of the types of vendors mentioned above as well as other things like availability of worthwhile content, bandwidth, and cultural acceptance. You could use chaos theory to figure out when markets and market shares of Netscape, Sun, and other vendors are sufficient to make the ""Internet"" value chain stable. Netscape's meteoric rise was perhaps the one factor that pushed the entire value chain into prominence. We can say that although the positions of various vendors in the Internet value chain may wax, wane, or blink out completely over time, the overall market and value chain is relatively stable, moving toward some strange attractor that we will eventually discover. (Installed base? Total sales? Market capitalization? Lewis doesn't specify.) This is all fascinating stuff, but Lewis stops short of supplying any depth or detail in his analysis.<query> what is the internet value chain</query> Although he does show examples of how chaos theory can apply to predicting stock prices, it would have been more interesting to show exactly how chaos theory applies to technology-driven value chains like the Internet. The New Lanchester Strategy The same lack of detail pervades other tantalizing parts ofThe Friction-Free Economy. Another example is Lewis's exposition of something he calls the New Lanchester Strategy. The New Lanchester Strategy is derived from the work of Frederick William Lanchester, an early 20th century British scientist and engineer whose theories of combat became major influences in the fields of operations research and, through W. Edwards Deming's (misspelled in the book as ""W. Edward Deming"") Total Quality Management. As Lewis puts it, Lanchester's theories of weapons and troop strength can be applied to sales and marketing in the friction-free economy.<query> who developed the new lanchester strategy</query> When adapted in this way, participants in a market fall into four categories: monopolist, leader, player, and non-player. He goes through examples of these categories, and how to use them, from the PC industry. But first, he defines these categories in terms of market share: 0 to 26.1 percent share means you're not a player; 26.1 to 41.7 percent means you are a player; 41.7 to 73.9 makes you a leader; and more than 73.9 percent means you have a monopoly. Where did he (or Lanchester) get these numbers? We never find out -- not even a brief explanation. It would be especially interesting to compare Lewis/Lanchester's scheme with Geoffrey Moore's taxonomy, from his book Inside the Tornado (reviewed in SunWorld, August 1996), that involves Gorillas, Chimps, and Monkeys (roughly speaking, a gorilla is a leader or monopolist, a chimp is a player, and a monkey is below player level).<query> what is the difference between a monopolist and a player</query> Moore describes his levels of competitor in terms of qualitative behavior in the marketplace, whereas Lewis claims some sort of hard statistical derivation of his categories. Unfortunately, we never find out where that derivation comes from. Another important ramification of the bits-based, friction-free economy is that it enables marketing techniques like mass customization, one-to-one marketing, and narrowcasting. The best elucidators of these trends are Don Peppers and Martha Rogers inThe One to One Future (see Bill's Bookshelf, March 1997) and their other books. Lewis doesn't seem to have read them. If you believe Peppers's and Rogers's point of view, then Lewis is confusing target marketing with one-to-one marketing. The former means breaking down the space of customers, by demographics or psychographics, into smaller and smaller groups.<query> who is the author of one to one marketing</query> The latter deals with individuals only and does analysis bottom-up, measuring share of customer (how much business does he or she give you over time) rather than share of market (how many customers do you have). This distinction may seem like merely semantic nitpicking, but Peppers and Rogers make a convincing case that the two require fundamentally different analysis techniques, organizational structures, and systems to make them work. Lewis doesn't see that difference. At the same time, the more important point is that in the friction-free market, individually targeted offerings become easy to manufacture. Lewis says, quite correctly, that the ""wired world"" makes it possible to customize products and services to individuals -- or small qualified groups -- with very little overhead, certainly far short of what it would take to modify a factory assembly line.<query> what is the difference between bottom up and friction free market</query> How to kill a giant The best part of this book is one of the last chapters, called ""How to Kill a Giant."" (The ""teeth-to-butt"" quote actually comes from that chapter.) In it, Lewis discusses attempts to beat the past and present giants of the computer business, IBM and Microsoft. He outlines four different strategies for overtaking market leaders: Brute Force, Momentum, Anti-Monopoly, and Pure. Unfortunately, Lewis never really explains what the brute force play is, except to illustrate it by example (Iomega beating SyQuest in the removable storage device sweepstakes). The momentum play means accelerating ""around"" the competition to obtain a larger market share. The example he gives of momentum play is that of the Network Computer, where Oracle, Netscape, Sun, IBM, and others are building a base of support for the NC that they hope will go around Microsoft/Intel's PC to become the dominant low-end computing platform.<query> what is momentum play</query> Notice that the momentum play primarily involvesmarket share and a value proposition for the product, rather than pricing issuesper se. The NC's value proposition does involve product price (an NC for $500), but it also involves ease of administration and lowered total cost of ownership. Lewis uses two examples to illustrate the anti-monopoly play: one unsuccessful (PowerPC vs. Intel) and one that might become successful (Java vs. Windows). Litigation is one of the tools he lists as useful in the anti-monopoly play; he considers litigation to be a tactic that helps but never fully succeeds in giant-killing. This perspective is especially interesting in light of Sun's recent decision to sue Microsoft over the terms of the Java license. His views on how the Internet is bringing society back to a ""tribal"" culture are harder to digest than they are to believe The pure-play strategy involves focusing, planning, and executing flawlessly.<query> what is the momentum play</query> It's what Microsoft has done with Windows and Sun has done with its servers. Lewis chooses a poor example for this one: Corel's PerfectOffice suite. It's unfortunate as explanation, because what Michael Cowpland (the CEO) is doing at Corel seems to resemble a brute force play more than a pure play. (Plus, given 20-20 hindsight, Lewis is wrong in his assertion that Corel is taking back the office-suite application market from Microsoft. PerfectOffice achieved notable sales volume only through the dubious practice known as ""channel stuffing,"" and Corel recently announced its decision to cease development on the much anticipated 100% pure Java office suite. At this point in time, Corel looks like it is in big trouble again.) The ""How to Kill a Giant"" chapter offers some clear thinking and a useful framework for companies as they seek to overtake market leaders.<query> who is the ceo of corel</query> Elsewhere in the book, Lewis's thinking and advice are not so clear or useful. His views on how the Internet is bringing society back to a ""tribal"" culture, and how tribalism relates to mass-customized products and services, are harder to digest than they are to believe. Another example: his definition of ""prosumption"" is just plain wrong. Prosumption is generally defined asproducers and consum ers collaborating on product/service production; the canonical example being a customized daily news service where the user specifies what kinds of things she wants to read. Lewis uses ""pyramid"" marketers, like HerbaLife and Amway, to define prosumption simply because those organizations' middle-tier members both buy and sell products. Lewis wanted to illustrate how businesses like these can become more efficient by using the Internet. This may be true, but I would suggest that if he wants to use a technical term for the way they do business,superdistribution is more applicable than prosumption.<query> what is prosumption</query> The Friction-Free Economy is a good piece of reading, on trains, planes, or stationary bicycles, for someone who isn't familiar with the work of its influencers. It's probably worthwhile to seek out T.G. Lewis when he is giving a lecture -- he's undoubtedly a dynamic, entertaining speaker. But it's better to invest the time in reading the works of Davidow, Moore, Gilder, Peppers and Rogers, and others to get a deeper foundation in marketing strategies for the Wired Age.

His writing style is filled with cutesy puns and alliterations, crass metaphors, and other low-rent rhetorical devices. Here is a sample paragraph (with italics included): Young and aggressive businesses start out with a very low teeth-to-butt ratio. These young wolves aspire to become lions by chewing their way across the Chasm on the way to mainstreaming. Being of limited teeth, wolves hunt in packs and bring down their prey by outrunning and outnumbering them. They have less butt, and less teeth -- not too much of either one -- but they are on their way to getting more of both. The ""Chasm"" refers to marketing guru Geoffrey Moore's concept of the gap in market acceptance between the small number of ""early adopters,"" who like to adopt the latest technology, and the large, highly lucrative mainstream.<query> who is geoffrey lewis</query> Lewis makes liberal use of Moore's material, as well as that of other business and technology visionaries like George Gilder, Alvin Toffler, Bill Davidow, Peppers and Rogers, and probably others -- but sometimes he does this without attribution of any kind. This book suffers from various editing problems. Several factual errors were left in (e.g., representing Microsoft chief strategist Nathan Myhrvold as ""Cameron Myhrvold,"" and various misspellings, such as the name of Larry Ellison's Savile Row tailor). Charts and graphs look too simple -- their curves too smooth, the distinction between actual and estimated data not made clear -- and their placement is often too far from references to them in the text. All of these problems obscure the substance of the book. This is too bad, because theThe Friction-Free Economy is largely an intelligent exposition of topics related to how the Internet changes many rules of economics and business.<query> what is the friction free economy</query> Lewis begins with a basic explanation of three of the most important economic theories: Adam Smith's 18th-century free-market capitalism, Karl Marx' 19th-century socialism, and John Maynard Keynes's 20th-century synthesis of the two. He does this in order to show how the ""wired world"" is engendering a new type of economics where none of these theories hold. A basic principle of modern economics is that supply and demand counterbalance each other, acting like an ""invisible hand"" to produce equilibria in markets and stability in a company's market share. According to Smith, the equilibrium point is one at which products are what everyone needs and prices are affordable. Marx disagreed, saying that without heavily regulated markets, the equilibrium point is one at which wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small number of rich people.<query> what is the basic principle of economics</query> Finally, Keynes proved through mathematical means that, in a sense, both Smith and Marx were right: There are two possible equilibria, and a given economy can end up at either one depending on a variety of factors.

A corollary is that, because the spread of information feeds on itself, a product can enter a positive feedback loop that results in ever-increasing market share. This has many interesting consequences for vendors of software and other bits-based products. Most notably, price is no longer the most important factor in determining financial viability and market trajectory of a product. Two things are more important: thevalue that a product adds as part of avalue chain, where other links in the chain may be supplied by other vendors, and the market share that a product has among its competitors who occupy the same link in the value chain. An example that Lewis cites to illustrate this and many other points is the rise of the Internet/intranet market, thanks to vendors like Netscape. ""Internet"" turns out to be a value chain that includes Web servers, routers, server software, browsers, search engines, Web site development tools, and so on.<query> why is price important</query> Netscape has many products that fit into this value chain, but by no means all of them -- servers come from Sun and others, routers from Cisco and Bay Networks, search engines from Lycos and InfoSeek, development tools from Wallop and Kiva, etc. Lewis observes that changes in things like adoption of a certain technology or a company's market share are governed by chaos theory instead of by traditional predictive mathematical models In order to play in this value chain, Netscape must get sufficient market share for its value chain links (products and services). That's why Netscape gave away its browser for a while before charging for it: to build the value chain to sufficiently attractive size and get enough market share of a particular link in the chain to assure longevity of theentire chain, while placing itself on a trajectory toward browser market dominance.<query> what is netscape's value chain</query> Conversely, as Lewis observes, Apple failed because it did not understand the idea of the value chain and how to fit into it. Instead, Apple insisted on remaining a vertically-integrated hardware and software company and built marketing strategies based largely on pricing. As another example, IBM began an extremely important value chain by opening the PC design to clone manufacturers, but it did not take sufficient steps to build market share as the value chain came into being. Another theoretical basis for the friction-free economy is that new, murky branch of mathematics called ""chaos theory."" Lewis observes that changes in things like adoption of a certain technology or a company's market share are governed by chaos theory instead of by traditional predictive mathematical models. Chaos theory is neither particularly easy to define nor completely understood, but for these purposes, its importance is that it divides quantity movements over time into three categories -- stable, chaotic stability (volatile but within limits), and true chaos (""off the scale"" to infinity or zero) -- and that stable or chaotically stable quantities converge on fixed points called ""strange attractors."" The key to using chaos theory to predict market behavior is to understand when a measured quantity -- such as a vendor's market share -- makes the transition from one of those three states to another in a system of many different contributing factors.<query> what is the theory of chaos</query>"

Login or Signup Amazon Taps Its Inner Apple By: Adam L. Penenberg July 1, 2009 Photograph by Hugh Kretschmer By introducing the Kindle, Jeff Bezos is emulating Steve Jobs -- and taking him on. Enlarge With his aggressive push into e-books, Bezos has traditional publishers running scared.<query> who is amazon's inner apple</query> ""In essence, you need to get the books into the stores and then the buyers into the stores to buy them."" But the Kindle, Maneker believes, could help Amazon bypass traditional publishers; the company could strike deals with big-name authors in lieu of advances, thereby minimizing up-front risk and solving the returns issue once and for all. In fact, Amazon has already done this, beginning with the e-book release of Stephen King's UR, a novella (list price $2.95) featuring a plot involving the Kindle. (Unlike most King works, this one even has a happy ending.) The book industry is especially vulnerable because it is a ""hits"" business, with a small number of breakaway titles (Harry Potter, The Tipping Point, Twilight) subsidizing all the rest.<query> what kindle is stephen king's ur</query> Take away publishers' best-sellers and you're left with stacks of money-losing operations. But authors such as Dan Brown, Malcolm Gladwell, Stephen King, Stephenie Meyer, and J.K. Rowling would all thrive in a system that let them skip advances in exchange for higher royalty rates. Instead of a star author getting the standard 15% on a hardcover, for example, Amazon could simply skim a 20% distribution fee, and the author gets the rest. In this model, ""the whole thing is structured so that you, as the provider of intellectual property, get the lion's share of the revenue after costs, not the publishers,"" Maneker says. If e-books take off, Amazon could cherry-pick the biggest-selling authors, and publishers would suddenly find themselves cut off from their most bankable sources of revenue.<query> who is the author of the best selling book on amazon</query> What's more, this threat doesn't persist solely with e-books. Here's a doomsday scenario put forth by Richard Curtis, a literary agent and founder of E-Reads, an independent e-book publisher: Suppose you are publishing the new Dan Brown title,The Lost Symbol, with a first printing on the order of 5 million copies, and Amazon logs 500,000 preorders on its site. Instead of Random House (which is publishing the book under its Doubleday imprint) transporting a half-million books to Amazon to box up in its warehouses and then ship to consumers, ""wouldn't it make even more sense for Amazon to turn to Random House and say, 'Look, don't ship those books to us. It's a waste of freight and fuel. Why don't you simply give us the file of the new Dan Brown and we'll print those 500,000 copies on demand on our BookSurge Press and drop-ship them to our customers?'<query> who is the founder of ereads</query> Random House would save on printing costs, freight, fuel, everything. It's such an efficient way of doing things as to seem irresistible."" Not just irresistible. Virtually irreversible too. Why, Curtis asks, would ""anybody need a traditional book publisher when you can essentially make Amazon your buyer and your seller in one stroke?"" Then Amazon doesn't merely control the distribution of books -- it controls the content, too, and the paradigm shift is complete. The struggle for this high-stakes channel may explain why Amazon can get downright nasty when dealing with recalcitrant publishers, resorting to brass-knuckle tactics to get what it wants. While friction between publishers and booksellers is inevitable, the relationship with Amazon has been particularly contentious, so much so that while many agents, consultants, and editors at publishing houses would talk freely if afforded anonymity, most would not consent to having their names appear in print.<query> why is amazon a publisher</query> (Amazon, for its part, declined to comment for this story.) Last year, to punish publishers that refused to buckle in negotiations over divvying up revenue (and to cave to its requirement that small publishers use its BookSurge print-on-demand service), Amazon disabled the 1-click ordering buttons on a broad range of books on its Web site both here and in the U.K. -- a tacticThe New York Times dubbed the ""nuclear option."" In a tart letter to his authors, Tim Hely Hutchinson, Hachette's chief executive in the U.K., lambasted Amazon's ""increasing demands"" and said if this continued, ""it would not be long before Amazon got virtually all of the revenue that is presently shared among author, publisher, retailer, printer, and other parties."" Amazon is still a long way from achieving this level of hegemony.<query> why did amazon stop publishing books</query> To get there, Bezos needs to win the race to nail down distribution of e-books and turn them into a mass-market phenomenon. He deserves credit for taking the first step -- propelling the e-book concept from mere curiosity to full-fledged consumer item, which he accomplished with the introduction of the Kindle. E-readers (Sony's, for example) and e-reader applications (several are available on the iPhone or over the Web) have existed for some time, but few consumers were talking about e-books until the Kindle arrived. Then it quickly began to coalesce an entire market -- much as Apple and the iPod did to MP3s and MP3 players. In some ways, Bezos has a tougher row to hoe, since music and books are intrinsically different. IPod buyers could digitize their entire compact-disc music collections and listen to songs over and over.<query> who created kindle</query> Kindle users can't scan their existing libraries onto their device -- nor will most people reread books. Plus, digital downloaders can buy one song at a time, but most book buyers wouldn't pay for one chapter at a time. To nab control of digital distribution, Bezos had to set prices low enough to motivate readers to forgo hardcovers and paperbacks for Kindle versions. Apple famously forced its flat 99- cents-per-song pricing on the music industry. And while, over the years, Apple has relinquished some of its power -- pricing is now tiered, with downloads running from 69 cents to $1.29 for the most popular tracks -- Jobs accomplished his mission, nevertheless. He established a virtual monopoly over digital distribution of music online, and to this day, maintains an 87% share in downloads. In the process, he poured the foundation for the iPod -- it garners 70% of the MP3 player market -- which, along with the iPhone it helped inspire, accounts for more than 40% of Apple's revenue.<query> what is the price of a song on kindle</query> Bezos certainly watched this play unfold over the years. One late entry to music downloads was Amazon itself, which has made only modest gains in the market, despite undercutting Apple on price. Through personal experience, Bezos knows how important it is to establish a hammerlock on the distribution system before another deep-pocketed foe enters the game. Even after establishing Amazon as a major online player in sales of compact discs, he was too late for digital downloads. He wasn't likely to make that mistake with e-books. Amazon's first move when it introduced the Kindle was to foist its $9.99 price on publishers. But while Apple ends up with pennies from each song it sells (after paying for bandwidth and infrastructure), Amazon actually loses money on many titles, with publishers earning between $12 and $13 per e-book.<query> what was amazon's first move</query> You might think that because publishers profit from this arrangement -- they don't have to pay for paper, ink, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation or suffer debilitating returns -- they would be pleased. They aren't. Amazon is creating a sticky price in consumers' minds and redefining the cost of a ""book"" just as Apple did with music. In fact, on Amazon there is a protest movement afoot as more than a thousand users tag for boycott any Kindle book listing for more than $9.99. If book buyers join forces with Amazon on price, publishers would inevitably lose. ""If you are in a position to dictate your purchase price, then you are well on the way to cornering the market,"" Curtis says. At that point, Bezos could head back to the negotiating table to wring even more concessions.<query> why is amazon a sticky price</query> Why should Amazon pay $12.99 for the Kindle version of a hardcover? Why not, say, half that? And like the record labels, if publishers don't want to be left out in the cold, they would have to play ball. Thus far, early reviews indicate Bezos's strategy is succeeding. The Kindle has legions of fans, and they tend to buy more books than the average reader. But it's still very early in the book's electronic evolution -- e-books comprise between 1% and 3% of book sales -- and Amazon isn't the only amazon trying to stake a claim. Hearst is planning an e-reader for magazines, and Rupert Murdoch is grumbling about investing in one for News Corp. Plastic Logic, of Mountain View, California, and Dutch-owned Polymer Vision are also looking to release e-readers later this year.<query> what is the price of kindle books</query> Apple may be a different story. | Photograph by Joe Pugliese/Corbis Outline Related Content related link Big Bangs To explain the present and divine the future, Amazon's founder and prognosticator-in-chief, Jeff Bezos, often turns to the past. Fond of historical analogies, Bezos has compared the dotcom boom and bust to the 1849 gold rush, the advent of electricity to today's broadband-infused Web, the printed book to a horse, and the Kindle reader to a car. Perhaps his trippiest simile likens the impact of the Internet on business to the Cambrian period approximately 550 million years ago, after the first multicellular creatures crawled out of the primordial ooze. That's when we experienced an evolutionary big bang, which engendered both the greatest rate of speciation the world has ever seen and its greatest rate of extinction.<query> who is jeff bezos</query> Then there's Google, with its stratospheric market cap and a partnership with Sony to offer millions of titles that are in the public domain, from Dickens to Tolstoy to Twain, which can be accessed over the Web or downloaded as PDF files, or through Sony's new e-reader. Google and the Authors Guild also arrived at an agreement last October to allow the company to scan, index, and display portions of some 6 million copyrighted books in exchange for a share of ad revenue. In targeting public-domain content though, Google is playing where the money decidedly isn't. This strategy feels a bit like Google's acquisition of YouTube. It rushes off to acquire all this content with no idea how it can be monetized. Yet in a sign of just how fast this market is evolving, by June Google had announced plans to sell digital versions of new titles -- with publishers setting the price -- by the end of this year.<query> what is google's public domain</query> Amazon's biggest vulnerability may simply be that the e-reader is not destined to be a stand-alone product. ""When we are down to one piece of technology that we can drag around with us everywhere, I hope it includes what the Kindle offers,"" says Judith Regan, former publisher of ReganBooks, a HarperCollins imprint. ""I love it. But how many people want another thing to carry? Kindle, plus iPod, plus iPhone, plus laptop, plus BlackBerry, plus wallet, hairbrush, and lipstick -- and my shoulder is sore."" Not to mention, she adds, the cost of all of these separate devices. This is where Amazon, with very little experience in designing and building electronics, is weakest -- and where Apple could sabotage Bezos's best-laid plans. For years, rumors of an Apple touch-screen media tablet have circulated, despite a now famous quote by Steve Jobs: ""It doesn't matter how good or bad [the Kindle] is, the fact is that people don't read anymore.<query> what is the weakness of amazon kindle</query> Forty percent of the people in the United States read one book or less last year. The whole conception is flawed at the top because people don't read anymore."" For Jobs-watchers, this was a clear indication that he must be planning an e-reader, for Apple's grand poobah is the master of the red herring. In the past, he downplayed video on the iPod, insisting that no one would watch a movie on a 2-inch screen; denied that Apple was working on a phone; and claimed that anything less than a full-featured laptop wasn't in the cards -- until last year's release of the MacBook Air. When Jobs goes to the trouble of criticizing a competitor's products, downplays its significance, or offers a blanket statement about not pursuing a certain market, that's when he often goes in for the kill.<query> what percentage of americans read one book</query> There is more substantial evidence that Apple may be planning a move into e-books. Last year, Apple filed a trademark application to revise the goods and services covered under its iTunes Store trademark, adding books for the first time. And a recent patent application, listing as lead inventors Steve Hotelling, the man behind Apple's multitouch-screen patents for the iPhone, and Jonathan Ive, Jobs's design guru, includes a multitouch e-book technology. U.S. patent application No. 20080204426 (""Gestures for Touch Sensitive Input Devices"") describes a method to ""simulate a finger turning the page in an actual paper-bound book."" The invention also makes it possible to ""whisk through"" a large chunk of pages. A second patent application, for a docking station to be used with a tabletlike device, also covers e-books.<query> who invented the e book</query> Of course, speculation has been rife in the blogs that Apple intends to release a multimedia tablet over the coming year or so. And an Apple media tablet with a 10-inch color multitouch screen, Wi-Fi, and perhaps 3G access to boot, could make the Kindle's grayscale screen, cramped keyboard, and one-note functionality seem mighty drab. Apple could also use the existing iTunes infrastructure as a virtual storefront to distribute the e-books -- it already sells audiobooks. Perhaps that explains another vivid rumor, offered by Andy Ihnatko of the Chicago Sun-Times, that trucks stuffed with books have been arriving on the Apple campus and leaving empty. ""I have heard the same rumor from very good sources,"" says Maja Thomas, senior vice president of digital and audio publishing at Hachette Book Group, but neither she nor any other publisher would confirm or deny whether Apple had licensed its books for the iTunes Store.<query> what kind of tablet does apple use</query> (Apple declined to comment for this article.) Nonetheless, this is how Steve Jobs could perform a jujitsu move on Jeff Bezos. After Amazon went through the trouble and expense of seeding the landscape, implanting the concept of the e-book in people's minds, creating a market where there wasn't one before, and moving to control the distribution system, Apple could muscle its way in with a full-color multitouch-screen media tablet that not only reads books but also offers video, music, Web surfing, email, and the combined power of the iTunes and Apple App Store. The device might even load into a desktop dock that accommodates a full-size keyboard. Books would only be a small part of what it offers, making it appeal to a vastly larger audience than the Kindle's. It's critical to remember that Apple is first and foremost a hardware company that cares little about making money on content as long as it can sell iPods -- or media tablets.<query> what kind of tablet is apple</query> Bezos, meanwhile, is stuck peddling a fairly primitive piece of technology. For his strategy to pay off, he needs either the Kindle to win the hardware arms race, or to find a way to make money on Kindle titles, or both. He's not afraid to lose money while he moves into a new niche -- the first five years of Amazon's existence were spent in the red -- but it can't go on forever. Unfortunately for Bezos, not only is Apple far more skilled at designing beautiful products people are eager to buy, but it may also be a more desirable partner for publishers than is Amazon. While Apple drives a hard bargain and might be eager to grind publishers into pulp on price, unlike Amazon, it has little desire -- or history -- of attempting to usurp the publishers' role or to control content.<query> why is amazon more desirable than apple</query> Suddenly, the hunter becomes the hunted, and if e-books take off, Amazon could find itself the odd man out. That doesn't mean Amazon will wither away. Evolution serves those able to adapt, and such a transformation of the book industry would take time. Amazon could leverage its online clout and, in the name of eradicating wasteful returns, push publishers to adopt print on demand, continuing to rake in money while it shores up its digital-books strategy. It is also pushing the Kindle DX for textbooks and newspapers -- with a screen roughly double the size of existing Kindles -- which Amazon is test-marketing at five colleges. In the meantime, Amazon could take a Microsoft approach to e-book applications -- in contrast to Apple's closed-hardware setup. Earlier this year, Amazon released a free Kindle iPhone app, and a company spokesperson stated plans to offer it ""on a range of mobile phones."" To further its reach, Amazon recently acquired Lexcycle, the creators of Stanza, the popular e-reader application in the ePub format -- a standard that competes with Kindle.<query> what kind of books does amazon sell</query> In the end, Bezos, ever the pragmatist, wants people buying Kindle books even if they don't read them on actual Kindles. As for book publishers, they benefit from a fragmented market with no single entity controlling the distribution pipeline. The more that Amazon and Apple duke it out, the better for them. At the very least, they receive a reprieve, since they would have at least two parties bidding to distribute e-books -- and as any author will tell you, it's always better when there is more than one offer on the table. Looking long-term, as readers migrate to digital books, there is a real possibility the basic form of the book will change. It is a process already under way, since the Internet has changed the way people access information, content, and entertainment.<query> why is it better for amazon or apple to distribute books</query> Evan Schnittman, vice president of global business development at Oxford University Press, believes constant connectivity is a looming threat to an immersive reading experience. ""I love to read but I know I read immersively somewhat less now -- and I'm in the publishing industry,"" he says. ""E-books are simply print books in digital form and my question is, Will that be enough? Is that really what we're going to want to be doing?"" If history is any guide, no; the decay of the printed word on paper is part of a predictable pattern of development. The incipient form of a new technology tends to mirror what came before, until innovation and consumer need drive it far beyond its predecessors. The first battlefield tanks looked suspiciously like heavily armored tractors equipped with cannons; early automobiles were called ""horseless carriages"" for a reason; when newspapers began serving up stories over the Web, the content mirrored what was offered in the print edition.<query> what is the definition of e-books</query> ""What's very dangerous,"" Bezos summed up, ""is not to evolve."" Evolution is not merely a theory for Amazon; it's part of its intelligent design. Originating as a single-cell online bookseller in July 1995, Amazon has, over its 14-year history, developed into a monstrous cybermall, offering millions of products and accumulating a market capitalization north of $34 billion. It peddles everything from music, movies, and video games to apparel, gadgets, gardening tools, lab equipment, health and beauty aids, even sex toys and the bonglike ""mini hookah."" Along the way, Amazon incorporated unvarnished user feedback into product pages, instituted a ""look inside"" function so readers can sample books, and launched Marketplace, which allows third-party sellers to list new and used products next to Amazon's.<query> when did amazon start</query> But even as an engineer wouldn't dream of starting with the raw materials for a carriage to design a new sports car, books will move far beyond paper and ink. Taking on the characteristics of our present online habits, and riding a wave of rapid innovation in screens and microprocessors, books may soon become multimedia events. In this transformative model, the book industry could actually be well-positioned. Publishers could team with authors and multimedia producers to forge a new channel for dynamic e-books that go far beyond linear prose; they may provide a blend of text, video, audio interviews, 3-D maps -- an entire ecosystem of content built on top of the book. ForTwilight, the teen-vampire novel by Stephenie Meyer, the multimedia might consist of a video game within the book, mini bios of characters, maps, music, and discussion threads.<query> what is multimedia in books</query> An interactive element would allow readers to create their own stories, or even their own animated short movies, using the characters in the book. Inevitably, the experience would also include links to products based on the game: T-shirts, action figures, vampire toothbrushes. Suddenly, a book with mere words on a page seems so limited. And not just books. Magazines and newspapers too. This doesn't mean traditional books will go completely out of print. ""Every night, I read five or six children's books to my daughter, and I ask what format could be better than what I have in my hand?"" says Siva Vaidhyanathan, associate professor of media studies and law at the University of Virginia. ""Is there a medium that can do Dr. Seuss better than what's in my hand while she sits on my lap?<query> what is the format of a children's book</query> I haven't been able to imagine it."" Of course, that's what they said about vinyl, CDs, and now the digital download. Today's entertainment-on-demand youth have grown up on a steady diet of digital fare. Multimedia books would dovetail nicely with their omnivorous appetites. And that should tell you just how tricky evolution is. One minute you're at the top of the food chain, the next you're somebody's lunch -- like the 6-foot-long anomalocaridids, the Cambrian era's largest predator. A cross between a giant shrimp and a stingray, the anomalocaridid flapped aquatic wings and crushed prey with razor-sharp teeth. Eventually, it died out, supplanted by another sea-based predator, the giant cephalopod, whose octopuslike descendants still roam the oceans, squirting ink as a defense mechanism.<query> what was the largest predator in the cambrian era</query> Contributing writer Adam L. Penenberg's book, Viral Loop: How The Most Cleverly Designed Companies Grow Themselves,based on his May 2008 Fast Company cover story, will be published by Hyperion in fall 2009.

While not the first gadget to offer an entire library in the palm of your hand or to deploy e-ink in mimicking the look of a printed page, the Kindle is the first literary hit of its kind, selling hundreds of thousands of units since its introduction in November 2007. It's also the first with built-in wireless 3G connectivity, making it possible to download whole volumes in less than a minute -- more than 1,500 books can fit on a single machine -- with titles costing usually less than half the price of a conventional hardcover. To further its e-reach, Amazon has announced a larger, more expensive Kindle DX for textbooks and periodicals, which it will test-market to college students.<query> what is kindle</query> Recently, Bezos claimed that Kindle e-books add 35% to a physical book's sales on Amazon whenever Kindle editions are available. Put another way, for every three print copies of, say, Malcolm Gladwell'sThe Outliers the site sells, it also sells one Kindle e-book -- or about 25% of total sales. Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney estimates that Amazon sold a half-million Kindles last year and projects its total e-book revenue, which includes sales of books and devices, to reach $1.2 billion by 2010. The company reports that 275,000 titles are available in the Kindle format, including nearly all 112 books onThe New York Times best-seller list. Amazon, for its part, makes no pretense of its plans. On its Kindle page, it states, ""Our vision is to have every book ever printed, in any language, all available in under 60 seconds."" In Bezos's mind, the Kindle is the logical evolution of a 500-year-old analog technology, and this frightens those in the $24 billion book-publishing industry already skittish about Amazon's growing clout.<query> how many kindle books are sold</query> In his Cambrian example, they fear they may be playing the part of a trilobite, one of the first creatures with eyes but which, like most other species from this period, faced mass extinction when it couldn't adapt to its changing environment. But there's no need to peer back a half-billion years for an apt analogy. There's a far more contemporary lesson: Bezos, the former hedge-fund manager with the shiny pate and amphibious build, may be cribbing from another techno titan. Jeff Bezos is trying to do to book publishers what Steve Jobs of Apple did to the music industry. With its iPod and iTunes Store, Apple carved out a largely virgin market so fast that it was able to wrest control of the digital-music distribution system and thus dictate what the record labels could do.<query> who is jeff bezos</query> With Amazon jamming (its latest earnings are sky-high even as other online retailers are in a state of malaise), Bezos may sense similar opportunity, a moment when he, in true Jobs-like fashion, could colonize this growing niche for the Amazon ecosystem. Should that happen, book publishers would have more to fear than just being squeezed. Amazon could phase them out completely, treating them as the ultimate middlemen orphaned by a new technology. But in a plot twist worthy of the latest Dan Brown novel, there's one man who could save them. And that man is Steve Jobs. In some ways, book publishing operates like one of Joseph Stalin's five-year plans. In the former Soviet Union, the government estimated how many combs, bars of soap, and cars people needed. Produce too many and you had a glut; too few meant chronic shortages.<query> who is steve jobs</query> Speculating on future demand may be a fool's errand, but that's precisely what publishers do -- often missing badly, resulting in return rates of 40%, 50%, even 60% in some cases. Books are one of the few retail businesses in which store merchandise is fully returnable to the manufacturer for credit, a seemingly irrational practice that grew out of publishers' need to induce booksellers to carry backlist titles. Stocking thousands of low-margin books takes up shelf space, after all, and booksellers have rent to pay. To ensure books would be in stores for readers to peruse and purchase required easing the risk in holding unsold inventory. Over the past 20 years, attempts to reform this highly inefficient distribution system have gone nowhere. There were simply too many entrenched interests, most notably Barnes & Noble, which resisted updating a model from which it clearly benefited.<query> what is the return rate on books</query> Then came the emergence of the Web as a distribution pipeline, and a new superpower entered the fray. While the vast majority of books are still sold in mammoth chains like Barnes & Noble, Borders (which is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy), Wal-Mart, and Costco, Amazon rules online, making up perhaps 10% or 15% of total book sales but maintaining an 80% market share online. The house that Bezos built instills enviable customer loyalty with the soft face it offers the public, reflected in its competitive prices, user-friendly Web experience, and excellent after-sales service. For book publishers, gone are the days of Maxwell Perkins-like editors tipping back Champagne cocktails and treating authors to lunches at the Algonquin. Today, ""books are about distribution and publicity,"" says Marion Maneker, former publisher of HarperBusiness.<query> what is the percentage of books sold online</query>"

Now there are Windows 7 Ultimate installs all over the place. Smart Move Ballmer! I give credit where credit is due and Jobs has made Apple THE hip upscale brand.

On the other hand, according to Des Dearlove[lxxiii], Microsoft attributes its success to: · a long term approach · results orientation · teamwork and individual drive · a passion for its products and customers; and · continuous customer feedback It is certainly results-oriented and Bill Gates undoubtedly has a genuine passion for his products, and Microsoft became the US symbol of a technology culture though the inhabitants of Silicon Valley thought that it was a copycat and fast follower rather than a genuine innovator; but I have less faith in the others - unless you count Microsoft's predilection for beta testing - putting out pre-release copies of the software for customers to test (or, as is often the case, to debug) the products as 'feedback'.<query> what is microsoft's success</query> On the other hand, Dearlove continues with what I suspect is the most important element which is only hinted at above; ""The company hires very bright, creative people and retains them through a combination of excitement, constant challenge, and excellent working conditions. The odd stock option helps too."" He is talking here of the more favoured of the two classes of employee, those in the product (development) groups who receive the lion's share of these benefits - where Gates regards 'writing code' (programming) as a higher calling - and the 'rest' are sometimes treated as the second class citizens he seemingly thinks they are; and, in particular quarter of its workforce who are temporary have almost no rights at all.. The company very successfully balances its famously demanding attitude to performance, where on the one hand 12 hour days are the rule and a full-time presence on site is demanded (with, rather surprisingly, teleworking discouraged [lxxiv]).<query> what is the difference between a company and a company</query> On the other it has a relaxed collegiate style - its headquarters at Richmond, with buildings to the design he admired at IBM, is indeed referred to as the Microsoft campus - and there is a dislike of any status symbols, where its employees dress informally, have the same furniture and identical (nine feet by twelve) offices - which helps when the frequent moves in group membership take place On the other hand, unlike in IBM, where 'open-plan' is still in vogue, each individual has a private office to themselves; so they can indulge in 'private thinking'. David Bank[lxxv] comments on its management culture, that (by the mid 1990s) ""Here was a company, a big company, where smart people ruled. Hierarchies and chains of command didn't matter.<query> what is ibm's culture</query> Overt aggression was cultivated, not tamed…for those who could play the game, the meritocracy was thrilling."" He added the footnote that the players were "" Almost entirely male, most were about to turn forty years old…old enough to internalize the baby boomer sense of their own unlimited potential…post industrial society was emerging, and a new class was rising. The power of the new, educated elite flowed from the manipulation of language and symbols…outcasts derided as nerds could attain unheard-of-wealth."" The result, as described by John Heilemann[lxxvi], is that ""The feelings that many employees had for their boss went beyond respect or loyalty or admiration and crept right up to the brink of infatuation: in one way or another, everyone in Redmond seemed to have a crush on Bill"". Dearlove's list of reasons for Microsoft's success is: · be in the right place at the right time - Bill Gates really is the luckiest individual alive · fall in love with the technology - he is just as lucky that the love of his life is the technology he plays with, and understands so well.<query> why did microsoft become successful</query> Indeed, it is significant that Steve Ballmer is CEO, handling all the 'routine' admin, whilst Gates has moved to become Chairman and, most importantly, Chief Software Architect - something almost unheard of elsewhere. One has to ask, however, what this new title means since - despite his defenders claims that ""What Bill cares about is writing great software "" - he reportedly[lxxvii] hasn't written any significant amounts of code since 1983, and his great strength has been making the deals which earned him billions - though those claiming to know him best say ""For Bill it's all about winning; the money's incidental"". · take no prisoners - as everyone, especially the US Justice Department, now knows he relentlessly crushes competitors · hire very smart people - in his case those with the highest IQs, straight from college; from the 120,000+ candidates who apply to Microsoft each year.<query> who is the ceo of microsoft</query> Above all, he looks for those he thinks are 'super smart' and (given his comments on the perishability of software) in particular can grasp new knowledge quickly[lxxviii]. He also ruthlessly headhunts the best people from other companies; paying them whatever is needed to get them. He even buys small software companies lock stock and barrel not just for their products but for their 'in-house programming assets'[lxxix]. · learn to survive - his is a voracious learning machine, though his competitors probably need the learning far more than he does · don't expect any thanks - he has become infamous, but that has almost been of his own choice · assume the visionary position - as I have already said, this is certainly what Gates would have us believe, but is in reality far from the truth.<query> what is the role of gates</query> Indeed, as Dearlove[lxxx] says elsewhere, ""In fact Gates himself is not an original thinker and does not actually rate people who are obsessed with original solutions to problems. Most people have only one brilliant idea in their entire lifetimes, he says. He believes that most solutions already exist somewhere and simply have to be identified. This he believes is his own great talent…"" I suspect he is right. I certainly applaud Gates' choice of The Economist (which he apparently reads from cover to cover, as I do) as the main source of his ongoing knowledge about the world. He, no doubt, would have concurred with the first paragraph in its new Economist Technology Quarterly (supplement)[lxxxi], where it says: "" Ideas are ten a penny…what makes a successful innovation…is the single-mindedness with which the business plan is executed, as countless obstacles on the road to commercialisation are surmounted, by-passed or hammered flat."" You could have no better justification for Gates' approach to development.<query> who is bill gates</query> · cover all the bases - the numbers game certainly represents a crucial aspect of his success, since (although hidden from sight), like IBM at its peak, his teams develop many more products than he ever shows to the world. Just as important, and as he showed in his approach to the Internet, when he is finally persuaded that he has made a mistake he is not afraid to do a U-turn. · build a byte-sized business - relative to its Wall Street valuation it is a small company, but even then its strength comes from its many businesses; each of which does not have more than two hundred staff . never, ever take your eye of the ball - he very clearly is obsessed with making money, and constantly worries (as did Tom Watson Jr.) about Microsoft becoming complacent and being overtaken by its competitors (as it earlier overtook IBM).<query> what is the most important thing to tom watson did</query> He has said[lxxxii] ""I know very well that in the next ten years, if Microsoft is still leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises."" Neither mention what seemed to be the main characteristic of Microsoft, set very personally by Bill Gates, that of total (centralised) control by one man. He ruled it with an iron rod; through just two groups of people, one of just three members and the other with seven; though it is not clear, now that he has moved on from being CEO, that he can still do this. Shark Mitch Kertzman, CEO of Sybase is quoted[lxxxiii] as, very perceptively if a little forcefully, saying that ""…Bill is the great white shark that looks at the minnows with no more consciousness than we look at a plate of food…The shark has no soul.<query> who is the ceo of microsoft</query> It know no boundaries. All it has is an appetite. When the shark gets hungry, it thinks, 'I'm hungry', so it eats. "" Until recently, however, few of his many admirers - including the business journalists in the media - mentioned his very tough, indeed sometimes questionable business tactics. Yet Microsoft, under Gates, is all about winning. Its famed motto """"A computer on every desk and in every home"" is an aggressive enough target, but the end of this slogan - now discretely implicit rather than overt as it originally was - ""…all running Microsoft software"" is an incitement to monopoly. The statement, by those claiming to know him best, that ""For Bill it's all about winning; the money's incidental"" offers an even better insight.<query> what is microsoft's motto</query> In fact, he was actually away on a previously booked business trip. In his absence, his wife - the who actually ran the business end of things - initially refused to sign the standard (but legally complex) non-disclosure agreement IBM managers placed in front of her; which - weighed down by IBM's legal baggage - they had to get signed before any substantial negotiations could take place. Despite the apocryphal stories, though, she did eventually sign[xi], albeit perhaps not fast enough for IBM. Some commentators say, again incorrectly, that her husband wasn't even contactable later or that he was just as offended by the non-disclosure agreement. More important, most say he wouldn't change the CP/M operating system to handle the 16 bits the IBM PC needed to use- or perhaps more believably wouldn't do this fast enough to meet IBM's near impossible deadlines.<query> who refused to sign ibm non disclosure agreement</query> It is not even the end that for him justifies the means, but simply the win. This might have earlier been seen as surprising, since his early model was that of IBM, and especially of the Watsons there. This is, presumably, why he was so successful in his initial negotiations with the company - his hero-worship must have come across, and who could have resisted such a fan (not to say groupie)! But, even then, and especially later, his business practices were almost the exact reverse of those of the Watsons. The latter may have fallen foul of Anti-Trust, but Gates almost seemed to seek it out and thrived on it; and on almost every other dubious business practice open to a business leader. The need to win seems to colour his whole life.<query> who was the first successful business leader</query> Although it is claimed that he can put aside personal issues to take rational decisions, it seems as if he personalises many of the competitive conflicts he enters into; and even views them as life and death battles, which they almost as often turn out to be for his victims! He is renowned for using public platforms to bad-mouth his competitors and their products. In particular, though, he ignores all the niceties (and sometimes the legal necessities) of business to business negotiations. Classically, he started negotiations with Ray Noorda - CEO at Novell - about to purchase his company. They jointly signed a non-disclosure agreement (as have other Gates victims), and Noorda obtained approval for the deal from his board. Gates decided against it, but did not bother to tell Noorda this or return the documents which had been exchanged[lxxxiv].<query> who is the ceo of novell</query> Noorda only found out from the reports given by Microsoft to the trade press. In that case, Gates only fanned an already deadly rivalry. In the somewhat similar case of Stac Electronics, whose disk compression software Microsoft wanted, the outcome was rather different. After that deal fell though, Microsoft's subsequent DOS 6.0 included a disk compression product so similar to Stac's that it won a $120 million patent infringement suit[lxxxv]. Others in a similar position could not afford to sue! But Gates is lucky that his opponents are not so ruthless, or so personally involved. When Noorda, who was so incensed by his treatment that he almost started a crusade, tried to bring the rest of the industry together to work against Microsoft, they couldn't agree - and Gates' tactics of divide and rule once more worked.<query> what was microsoft's disk compression software</query> The Trial I will cover this subject only briefly, since this is a book about management practice not jurisprudence. If you want more, I would suggest you read John Heilemann's blow by blow account 'Pride Before the Fall'[lxxxvi] or the chapters in David Bank's excellent book [lxxxvii] ""Breaking Windows"". For the record, despite its protestations that it was still a small company and its rather incompetent performance at the trial, by that time Microsoft's legal department had grown from the three people it had in 1985 to more than 300 employees[lxxxviii] - 150 of them attorneys - almost as many as IBM had at its peak! Despite this plethora of lawyers, and the previous consent decree, the trial heard Microsoft had failed to adopt any official anti-trust compliance policy or a comprehensive anti-trust training regime for its employees.<query> how many lawyers were in the microsoft trial</query> His fall from grace came when he thought he had lost the Internet to Netscape. He then violated every rule of crisis management; letting its natural belligerence destroy its image; turning Gates from a 'golden geek' into a robber-baron.. Perhaps the most blatant example of the resulting business practices, and the one which finally provoked the attention of the Justice Department, was his treatment of Netscape. As Gary Rivlin reported[lxxxix], ""For public consumption Microsoft's goal was trumping Netscape feature by feature. [ but] Privately the aim of the Internet Explorer was to teach Netscape a lesson…Microsoft employees vowed that they wouldn't be satisfied until the price of Netscape's stock had fallen by at least two thirds"". It showed its hand most blatantly in the case of Compaq, which had been selling PCs pre-loaded with Netscape Navigator; and which insisted on sticking to this deal.<query> what was the goal of netscape</query> Again according to Gary Rivlin[xc], the unwise response from Microsoft was to threaten its longtime partner with a 'Notice to Terminate License Agreement' which essentially said that Compaq was free to choose whatever browser it wanted - but if it chose Navigator over Explorer it would lose the right to sell Windows! Even Compaq, despite its size as the then brand leader, was forced to give way. Microsoft's key strategy was simply to give Explorer away for free. Microsoft's Paul Maritz told a meeting of industry executives ""We are going to cut off their air supply…Everything they're selling, we're going to give away free…How long can they survive…""[xci]. Thereafter it successfully targeted exclusive deals with the five largest Internet access providers and offered others offers they couldn't refuse! The trial which eventually destroyed Microsoft's image came about, though, because Gates blatantly ignored the terms of the consent decree which he had agreed in 1995; which had laid down the terms of his competition with Netscape.<query> why did microsoft give away explorer</query> He believed he had written a massive loophole into it - letting Microsoft add new features - such that he could do almost what he wanted. However the Department of Justice (DOJ) took a different tack. Under it the company was explicitly prohibited from requiring OEMs to license any other product as a condition of using Windows. But Microsoft's marketing plans showed that was exactly what it intended to do with Internet Explorer version 4! Microsoft's response to the subsequent DOJ investigations was adversarial in the extreme, possibly pushing the DOJ into the full-scale anti-trust action, and the damage to its image started to grow. Indeed, throughout the whole case it - and especially Gates - was aggressive. When Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held a hearing in his office, but was fifteen minutes later due to being on the floor of the Senate casting his vote, Gates is reported[xcii] to have said ""Well, given that we are starting 15 minutes late and I'm only going to have 45 minutes now, we should get right to it."" Things went down hill from there!<query> what was microsoft's response to the doj investigation</query> In particular, when the two sides met for what might normally be expected to be an attempt to thrash out a settlement, according to John Heilemann[xciii] Gates held forth for two hours, lecturing the DOJ. He asked no questions of it and his answers took the form of 'prolonged soliloquies'. Not surprisingly there was never a meeting of minds; at a time when a settlement was possible - in the previous 1995 settlement it had already conceded most of the issues - and, though in its arrogance it did not realise it, was needed by Microsoft. Even in retrospect, its failure to settle was not just serious but inexplicable. Possibly Bill Gates arrogance played too big a role or possibly its attorneys failed to understand the magnitude of the case about to face them. Where they though it might focus narrowly on the breaches of the consent decree, in fact it would focus on one large question: whether the company had 'maintained its operating-system monopoly through exclusionary and predatory conduct' - a much wider and more dangerous question.<query> why did microsoft fail to settle</query> When the case came, however, probably the most damaging encounter took place outside if the courtroom -in August 1998 in one of Microsoft's own conference rooms. Bill Gates faced David Boies, the DOJ's special trial counsel, who was expecting Gates to be as smart, tough and articulate as he had been at previous meetings. Instead Gates was petulant, dour and cantankerous. The videotaped interrogation went on for twenty hours over three days. Boies was delighted with the results, for they showed Gates and Microsoft in the worst possible light. On key questions Gates either turned amnesiac, and tried to play word games. Thus, as described by [xciv] John Heilemann, one key exchange was about an email message at the top of which was the phrase 'Importance: High'. In answer to various questions Gates steadfastly denied that he had typed this - and indeed it was written by the software - but, as Boies was able to establish, this was an attribute set by the user (Gates).<query> who was bill gates in the microsoft case</query> So, the conclusion of the exchange was Boies saying ""…so you're the one who set the high designation of importance, right sir?"", forcing Gates to reply ""It appears I did that."" The rest of the twenty hours was much the same; a disaster for Gates. On reason for this poor, and unprepared, performance may have been that Gates, steeped in the law from the time he was an infant, appeared to think he had a greater mastery of law than his lawyers; and they seemed to concur with this view. Another explanation might have been that they assumed that the video would never be shown; since Gates would be going into the witness box himself. Unfortunately, after this performance, nobody dared let him go near any cross-examination! However, this left the prosecution to play selected, very damaging, excerpts from the videotapes.<query> why did bill gates fail to answer questions</query> Whatever the reason, Gary Kildall ruled himself out of the main race - though (after threatening legal action over the similarities between DOS and CP/M) he was later allowed to put CP/M on the new IBM machine; but foolishly chose to price it at $240 per copy against Microsoft's $40[xii] - and that was the final nail in its coffin! So, in one of the lucky chances which have so characterized Gates' career, Kildall handed the resulting billions to Bill Gates - who by then no longer felt he had to live up to his previous agreement with Kildall! Gross Failures…whilst few individuals, or organizations, achieve outstanding results, the one way you can be sure to beat the odds, in terms of achieving anything other than an average performance, is tofail; badly!<query> who bought cpm</query> These did not just fatally damage Microsoft's case, but they did even more damage to its public image! Although Gates did not go into the witness box, he did - that December - give a press conference; at which, compounding the problem, he accused Boies of being out to 'destroy Microsoft' - which phrase led the reports in all the papers next day, suggesting he was paranoid and self-pitying (scarcely the image he and his PR advisors might have wanted to achieve!). Some of the other Microsoft defence evidence was not much better; giving the distinct impression that it had been tampered with - again hardly ideal for its image. The outcome was the worst possible. The case against Microsoft was deemed proved. The remedy was even worse - Judge Jackson decreed that Microsoft should be broken up.<query> what was the outcome of the microsoft case</query> Though this particular remedy was set aside - influenced by a more business 'friendly' Bush jr. administration - on appeal in 2001, the proven verdict was maintained; leaving its future damagingly open to speculation! Privateer The real importance of Bill Gates is not, though, that he successfully flaunts society's values. It is that, in many ways, he encapsulates the new values society, or at least US society, believed was acceptable - and even desirable - from its new entrepreneurial business leaders. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, 'market-driven society' had won the argument - in the famous words of Francis Fukayama, it was 'The End of History'. In the 1990s market values became all that mattered, and the only values which really counted were those of money.<query> what was the importance of bill gates</query> How you got that money did not matter, and, where the CIA no less was believed to be involved in drug running, even borderline criminal activities could be justified on the back of the money being made. The best historical analogy was perhaps the licences given by first Queen Elizabeth to the privateers; not least to Sir Francis Drake, who was just as admired in his time and since as has been Bill Gates. Apart from their licences, these privateers were little different to pirates. They attacked merchant ships - albeit Spanish ones - not for their own country but for their victim's treasure. Like Gates, their one aim in life was to destroy the competition - no matter how this was done. It was war, but on a very commercial footing - as its Microsoft's! Piracy and Other Business Methods…it may be generally observed that the most money is to be made by sailing closest to the wind.<query> who was the first privateer</query> Indeed, the largest fortunes may be accumulated by those, such as Bill Gates, who are most determined to push out the boundaries of what may (just) be legal. This is even more true of those - such as in the arms and intelligence industries - who are willing to undertake those things even governments themselves are nervous about! The borderline between the acceptable and the illegal is usually only explored in terms of the ethical issues involved. The question which needs to be asked, of society rather than Microsoft, is this what we want. The relatively gentle exploration of new horizons which the Watsons undertook, has been ruthlessly replaced by the plundering - by a whole generation of managers not just Bill Gates - of the resulting spoils. With a personality which might be more favourably compared to Blackbeard than Drake, is Gates the leader who may eventually bring the whole post-1989 system crashing down?<query> who is bill gates</query> [i] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press [ii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p129 [iii] Heilemann, John, (2001) Pride Before the Fall, HarperCollins, p54 [iv] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p8 [v] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p96 [vi] Chposky, James & Ted Leonsis (!989) Blue Magic: The People, the Power and the Politics Behind the IBM Personal Computer, Grafton Books, p40 [vii] Lowe, Janet, (1998)<query> who wrote the plot to get bill gates</query> Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p11 [viii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p32 [ix] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p29 [x] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p33 [xi] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p33 [xii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p35 [xiii] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p34 [xiv] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone p23 [xv] Rivlin, Gary, (1999)<query> who wrote the plot to get bill gates</query> The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p27 [xvi] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p27 [xvii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p22 [xviii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p25 [xix] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p60 [xx] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p61 [xxi] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p69 [xxii] Stross, Randall E, 1996)<query> who is bill gates's wife</query> The Microsoft Way, Little Brown, p36 [xxiii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p77 [xxiv] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p85 [xxv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p28 [xxvi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p10 [xxvii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p98 [xxviii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p102 [xxix] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxx] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxxi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxxii] Stross, Randall E, 1996)<query> who is bill gates barbarians</query> The Microsoft Way, Little Brown, p56 [xxxiii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p48 [xxxiv] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p48 [xxxv] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p54 [xxxvi] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p54 [xxxvii] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p100 [xxxviii] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p65 [xxxix] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p206 [xl] Rivlin, Gary, (1999)<query> who is bill gates speaking for</query> The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p208 [xli] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p132 [xlii] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p54 [xliii] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p55 [xliv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p96 [xlv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p131 [xlvi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p132 [xlvii] Lowe, Janet, (1998)<query> who wrote breaking windows</query> In particular, the organizations which stand out from the crowd are typically those which have taken such bad decisions that they have in effect destroyed themselves. Much is suggested about how to succeed in business, but little is said about avoiding failure. Even so, Bill Gates, opportunistic bright guy that he was (and still is), had an almost non-existent organisation, with a very limited track record; and did not even have an operating system to offer! It has been suggested by some commentators that the key to this was that John Opel sat on the same board, of the charity United Way, as Bill Gates' mother, Mary. I personally doubt this, since Opel wasn't involved at the time, but Janet Lowe[xiii] insists this was the case. The regular face to face meetings with his mother must, though, have later made it even more difficult for John Akers, who had then taken over his predecessor's place on the board, to act against a supplier (her son, Bill Gates) - and in the process against IBM's own philosophies - in any really aggressive way.<query> who was bill gates mother</query> Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p119 [xlviii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p21 [xlix] Gates, Bill (1995), The Road Ahead, Penguin, p91 [l] Neff, Thomas J. & James M.

Based on my own experiences of similar situations within IBM, my own suspicions are that the IBM personnel found Bill Gates a useful front man for taking actions which the IBM system would not have let them take. Had they tried to write their own software it would have been bogged down in quality control procedures for years. Had they tried to buy outright some software, and it then became IBM's, it too would have been bogged down with IBM's Business Practices staff and in risk-control procedures for months. Bill Gates took all these problems away from the group; and, precisely because his was such a small organisation, the IBMers probably thought they still had some degree of control (though, of course as events were to prove, they didn't!).<query> why did bill gates take over ibm</query> I myself from time to time used similar outsiders to front work for IBM which would have been impossible to get through the system otherwise. Regulating Bootleggers…organizations often come to depend upon 'illicit' development operations in order to bypass their bureaucracies. Such approaches may be essential to future development. They can, though, subvert the whole organisation - so senior management needs to develop the special skills (in particular those of balancing freedom against risk control) to manage such operations. Apart from the work of Peters & Waterman, which refers to 'skunkworks' management, theory pays little heed to those who operate on the borderline of legitimacy (and none to control over their potential subversion). In terms of why Armonk did not see the risks, Paul Carroll (in Big Blues) says, of the key meeting of the Management Committee (MC) which approved the setting up of the group, that""...the Management Committee continued to see this review as just one of the numerous proposals that came in front of them each week.<query> who regulates bootleggers</query> Lowe and his team thought of the PC as a home computer and continually referred to it that way, so it hardly seemed as if would be of any interest to IBM's corporate customers."" In other words the MC approved ahome computer not the Personal (Business) Computer it later became. He goes on to say of the other key issue; ""There was little discussion about whether using outsider's parts would mean IBM couldn't control the direction the market would take, the way that IBM controlled everything about the lucrative mainframe market. But nobody in the room had the foresight to realise how important the personal-computer market would become or how little control IBM would, in fact, have. The MC members worried more about the possibility that outsiders would be allowed to sell the PC, because IBM wasn't sure it could make then live up to its blue-suited white-shirted standard.<query> why was the pc a personal computer</query> Even that concern didn't really heat up until later."" As it was a home computer, aimed at a small market (and with only a small investment at stake) did it matter? You bet it did, but - given the information in front of them - there was no way they could have known that. A much better question is why didn't they do something later when theydid find out what was happening? Des Dearlove[xiv] says of the deal ""The effect was like introducing a fat and sleepy buffalo to a piranha."" Internal Weak Signals…the problem of detecting weak signals in the external environment is well understood - though no solution is generally available - but that of recognizing the equivalent signs of impending 'fractures'within the organization is not. These may represent an even greater a threat to the future of the organisation; and the solutionis available - all it needs is a management information system which reports on them!<query> why did the piranha react to the weak signal</query> Most management theory does not, however, even allow for such internal fractures. At the time Microsoft's business was based on porting mainframe languages to minis, and its main product was its BASIC interpreter for these. This was reportedly[xv] developed (setting another precedent) on the back of hundred of hours of illicit time spent on the Harvard computer when he was studying there (and against the rules allowing an outsider to work on the same commercial development, for which - again demonstrating his unbelievable luck - he only got a slap on the wrist). So when Bill Gates and his team were also visited by IBM - they assumed that this was what they wanted. Unlike Digital Research, they happily signed the non-disclosure agreement and, uncharacteristically, were very deferential to IBM - a posture they adopted with IBM (but nobody else!) until the deal finally fell apart!<query> what was microsoft's main product</query> So it is reasonable to imagine Akers agonizing over how he could 'do the dirty' on Mrs. Gates' nice young son when, paradoxically, Bill Gates himself would never had any qualms had the situation been reversed!. Indeed, when they first met him the IBM team thought Gates was the office boy (an image he seemingly cultivated since his 'adversaries, to their disadvantage, then consistently underrated him) - Perhaps setting the precedent for the business practices to come, the BASIC work had already been the subject of a lawsuit about ownership with Pertec; though in that case, for once, the arbitrator admonished Pertec for its business practices not Microsoft. Opportunism…Bill Gates' greatest skill is that of applied opportunism; of quickly recognizing potential opportunities and then getting behind them.<query> who is bill gates</query> That, rather than his place in the pantheon of business gods - or devils - is what really earns him his place in this tome about business giants. In view of his very different values, though, some go further to describe him as the 'anti-Christ' to IBM's previous 'snow white'. Indeed, whatever view you take, you cannot avoid the fact that the early history of Bill Gates and his company was inextricably intertwined with that of IBM (or at least of its PC Group); and maybe, if you want to pursue the Anti-Christ theory, you can argue that he has been the beneficiary of a great deal more luck than any mortal has a right to expect. On the other hand, Gates has always had a very clear vision of what is important to an IT supplier.<query> who is bill gates</query> This ability is in part a gift, but it can be developed by opening the mind to the whole range of opportunities. Dignified by the umbrella term of 'creative management', a range of techniques have been developed by some academics. The IBM team were, in the meantime, reporting that despite his lack of resources (but presumably impressed by his deferential demeanor) they felt they could work with Bill Gates; an off-the-cuff judgement which later came back to haunt IBM. QDOS Thus, when the IBM team returned, they offered Gates the BASIC software business but - much more important - they mentioned, almost as an aside, their need for an operating system. Gates, the supreme opportunist, jumped at the chance to bid; where, to give him his due, most of us would not have had the courage to do so.<query> what is the role of creative management</query> There are a number of semi-apocryphal stories about what happened next. One suggests that Gates was already friendly with Rod Brook, the owner of Seattle Computer Products, who was developing a 16-bit operating system called SCP-DOS (Seattle Computer Products Disk Operating System) or, according to a number of other sources, called QDOS (rather ominously standing for 'Quick and Dirty Operating System'!).Whatever the real story, Bill Gates was left to find an operating system and eventually located one. The most important aspect though, according to Paul Carroll, was that Bill Gates' contact in IBM - Jack Sams - told him topurchase the operating system; again as I probably would have done, to get round IBM's internal systems. Gates paid $75,000 for it - $25,000 initially, for the licensing rights, and then $50,000 for the exclusive rights, in his own name - and nobody can deny that, in terms of the billions he subsequently made from it, it was a bargain!<query> what was bill gates operating system called</query> Soon afterwards (again according to Carroll) Sams, who - perhaps understandably - may have wanted Microsoft to remain viable so his own operation within IBM would not fail, persuaded Gates to take a tougher negotiating line with IBM. It was a lesson Gates learned well, and later followed to IBM's great disadvantage! Arguably, as you follow the story of Microsoft, Bill Gates strength was indeed that he was an outstanding negotiator; and it was a skill first taught him (at least in part) by IBM. He was also lucky. QDOS borrowed somewhat from CP/M, and just before the launch of the PC DR threatened a lawsuit on this basis; but IBM bought them off by also putting DP/M on the machine alongside (IBM) DOS (Disk Operating System) as Microsoft's product was then called (the version which later powered the clones was, for obvious reasons named rather differently - as PC DOS).<query> who was bill gates</query> It was DR's poor judgment, and again Microsoft's good luck, that they botched their whole marketing effort (and priced their system at six times as much as DOS). Confident Negotiation…probably the main 'skill' needed in negotiation is confidence. On the one hand, if you have nothing to lose or, on the other, if your experience leads you to expect a good outcome, your confidence will usually make you an excellent negotiator. The nervous negotiator, who is uncertain of the outcome, will almost always lose. Negotiating skills are, rather questionably, usually the preserve of specialist - very commercial - trainers. He was even luckier that IBM did not insist on an exclusive licence; though, paradoxically, Gates had been - in 1976 - one of the first to vehemently object to the pirating of software; claiming that his BASIC had taken up $40,000 of machine time - which may have been true, but he failed to mention it was from Harvard that he illicitly obtained this[xvi]!<query> what is the main skill in negotiation</query> At this time, courtesy of IBM, he was set free to sell this new software to other hardware suppliers. At the time, when IBM held such a dominant position, this probably did not seem relevant; but later, when the position was reversed and the clones dominated the market - using Microsoft's PC DOS - it clearly was seen to be a historic mistake. Thus, though he was only paid a one-off fee of $200,000 by IBM for its own PC DOS, he was almost literally given a licence to print money with his own version; MS DOS. IBM Loses Its Bottle Above all, though, it was Bill Gates' abilities as a negotiator, and the lack of ability of his IBM opposites which determined the day. According to Paul Carroll, at the first set of key meetings, in 1985, when IBM might have re-negotiated the deal - since IBM was still in an immensely strong position (and indeed was eventually offered - in an unusually conciliatory gesture in 1986 - a 10 per cent share of Microsoft, which it turned down!)<query> who was bill gates</query> - it was William Lowe (who had by then taken over, again, from Don Estridge) and his boss Mike Armstrong who were indecisive. Carroll goes on to say ""That indecisive quality can leave IBM vulnerable - as it did repeatedly in Lowe's and Armstrong's dealings with Gates."" Whatever the reason, at this critical time, and over the next few years, Bill Gates regularly negotiated himself out of having to make a less favorable deal with IBM - and even from having to face competition from it. For a decade, somehow or other, he kept IBM off his back - and set the basis for his billions! Incredibly, considering the constant in-fighting, the relationship lasted until 1992; though over most of that time Gates already had a team planning what Microsoft needed to do if IBM ditched it!<query> who was bill gates boss</query> Indecision…almost worse than taking the wrong decision may be not taking the decision at all! Management theory does insist, perhaps at times with rather too much machismo, that decisions must be taken promptly. Windows The crucial development was, however, that of the Windows - which was eventually launched as genuinely workable operating system (as version 3.0) in 1990. Although IBM apparently conceived the idea of its equivalent OS/2 in 1984, Gates - as always ahead of the game - reportedly had become interested when, at the November 1982 COMDEX, he had seen the VisionOn graphical interface launched by VisiCorp; then one of his main rivals in applications software, with revenues on the back of its VisiCalc spreadsheet which were then double those of Microsoft. In typical style, Gates reacted to this - as described by Edstrom & Eller, the latter having been a key member of Gates' programming team for thirteen years [xvii] - like ""Saul on the road to Damascus "".<query> when was windows os introduced</query> He saw both the threat, VisiCorp could set the standard (as it seemingly had already decided to do), and the matching opportunity. He immediately set his best programmers working on it, two years before IBM even started to consider anything like it; and eight years before Microsoft's finally successful version appeared; so the other lesson perhaps is that even Microsoft's best programmer's can't always deliver next week! In another typical move he had purchased a $15,000 Xerox PARC Star system; so his team could 'reverse engineer' (copy the workings of its software, though not the exact code - which is the part that is always copyrighted) its most innovative features - especially its use of icons, which is now such a familiar part of Windows. Again using whatever (even dubious) means at his disposal, Gates eventually hired Scott McGregor, who had written Xerox's windowing system [xviii], to lead his own graphics group.<query> who wrote windows graphics</query> With Dan McCabe duplicating VisiOn's windows and Rao Ramala working on the icons, a (demonstration) prototype was ready by April 1983; though this only demonstrated the concepts and was a long way (eight years) from a working system. Even so, the Interface Manager Group of just ten people - whose only strategic advice from Gates (once more typically) had been to 'squash VisiOn' - was in chaos until new management, including McGregor, was put in place. The key to success, however, was not writing the software but persuading the software and hardware vendors (playing each off against the other) to write the drivers which allowed their products to interface with Windows - an investment by them which has since become a barrier-to-entry protecting Microsoft's monopoly position.<query> when was vision created</query> According to Martin Eller[xix], Gates was fixated upon IBM; even though it was the only major PC vendor not to support Windows. His near obsession was, though, perhaps understandable when its support had been so important in the creation of his fortune - and, at that time, it was of course still the giant which dominated the industry (whose ire it was not wise to earn!). But meeting IBM's needs frequently seemed to get in the way of the rather chaotic development of Windows. Thus, when IBM announced an, ultimately unsuccessful, upgrade to DOS but also a competitor to Windows - TopView - Gates wanted to support this; despite the fact that meant support for DOS, which the developers were having difficulty maintaining in the new operating system. Eller makes a quite fundamental observation, though an inevitably biased one, when he suggests[xx] that at the time ""Gates had never been involved in any of the architectural design of Windows, nor had he ever been personally involved in writing such large amounts of code…and he seemed totally oblivious to the fact that every feature change radically screwed up Window's stability, testing, and ship date."" In fact even now, despite more than 25 years working in software Gates has held just one patent.<query> who was the first pc to support windows</query> In his excellent book[i], which gives the most comprehensive coverage of events surrounding Microsoft's changes of direction at the end of the 1990s, David Bank nicely summarized a lengthier email from him in 1997 as: ""…one idea: as hardware gets cheap software gets valuable. Software is the bottleneck. Computer software will always be in shortage because what people want to do with computers is always increasing. "" Luck… teaching sales managers in IBM, I used to emphasize the four factors they would need to achieve an outstanding performance. In descending order of importance, they were: Achievable Objectives - the first was by far the most important. It was simply the ability to persuade those setting the objectives - be they higher management or the stockholders - to expect less than might be actually achievable.<query> why is software the bottleneck</query> The result was a lack of strategic direction for a year. When, in 1984, the delivery date still was a year over the horizon, and the size of the software meant that it would only run on a PC with a hard disc, McGregor left and with him went much of what technical leadership there might have been. Even when, in November 1985, Windows 1.0 did finally make it out of the door, it didn't support either Mac or TopView applications and, once more according to Eller[xxi], its DOS compatibility was a joke. He summarizes the position as ""In short, the product was essentially useless""; so maybe that is why Microsoft seemed to want to forget about it! Gates left only a three man team in place keep the project alive in theory, but it had clearly gone to the bottom of his priority list where (surprisingly in view of its phenomenal success later) it remained until the early 1990s; when the sale of a million copies of Windows 3.0 eventually awakened Gates to its potential.<query> when did windows 1.0 come out</query> In the meantime Gates once more focused on IBM, and OS/2. The main problem emerging from the joint work with the IBM development team was not just the difference in dress and culture but, much more importantly in programming standards. Having worked with the IBM PC development labs at Hursley myself, I am aware of just how much of their time is spent on debugging their programmes - and, in particular testing them - so that when they go out the door they are near perfect. Microsoft's programmers, pushed by Bill Gates, were more concerned that their work went out fast; and testing (or even thorough debugging) was a luxury they would happily dispense with. Indeed, Gates is obsessed with the perishability of software, as reported by Randall Stross' book[xxii] 'The Microsoft Way', he has said "" …there's not a single line of code here today that will have value, say, in four or five years time"".<query> who is bill gates</query> That is why their later discovery of beta-testing, whereby the testing could be passed to customers who would even pay for the privilege, came as a nicely cost-effective development. But, needless to say, their cavalier attitude did not impress the IBM programmers; even though the resulting speed of development was why IBM was so keen to use them to get round its own bureaucratic delays! IBM needed them, and they still needed IBM's money and prestige. Beta Testing…using customers to test, and even develop, new 'products' is very productive for the vendor, and well received by the customers (as it leads to an interactive dialogue). In one variation on the approach, the Japanese vendors launch many incrementally new products and wait to see which is the fittest - and survives.<query> why did ibm use beta testing</query> This was very different to the traditional Western approach which looks for radical developments; though the high-tech industries have now widely adopted beta-testing (though perhaps without really understanding what is involved!). Because IBM wouldn't build support for Windows into the TopView software they were also developing, the Microsoft team were looking for alternatives. The one they found was a TopView clone called Mondrian, developed (yet again) by a small company, Dynamical Systems Research (DSR) owned by a group of Princeton Physicists. Microsoft bought the company for a stock swap (not even cash) valued at around $1.5 million[xxiii]. In the process, in a typical move, gates also 'bought' Nathan Myhrvold, who became his most influential technical advisor in the early 1990s. Eventually, in 1986, to the delight of Gates IBM did indicate that it might support a Windows type interface; though it still did not go as far as doing anything about it!<query> who made mondrian</query> As a result of Gates betting his future on OS/2, by the end of 1986 Windows was seen - within Microsoft at least - as an orphaned bit of code, though the application developers continued to use it as a useful model so they would be ready to port their work to OS/2 (which Gates, perhaps rather foolishly, thoughtwould be compatible) when it came. By then, however, the IBM OS/2 team had now been split, to include IBM's Hursley lab in the UK - with whom, by coincidence, I was working at the time. As described by the various commentators, the eight-strong Microsoft team may have been ensconced at Hursley for three weeks in the luxurious mansion there - annoying the local IBMers by playing Frisbee on the extensive lawns - but IBM's own dozens-strong programming team was (perhaps more significantly) holed up on the top floor of an ordinary office building in Basingstoke new town - ten miles a way.<query> where was microsoft os2 developed</query> Indeed, IBM and Microsoft did eventually launch, jointly, OS/2 Presentation Manager - two years after the IBM statement - at the end of October 1988. Significantly, signaling his enthusiastic support at the time for OS/2 rather than Windows, Gates is quoted[xxiv] as saying ""This is the milestone that changes the rules for everybody…OS/2 Presentation Manager will be the environment for office computing in the 1990s."" I guess that this is one time IBM now wish his proud boasthad come true! His partner, Steve Ballmer, was even more explicit ""This is it, after this we're not going to have any more Windows. It's all OS/2"" Indeed, the next version of Windows, version 2.01 which was full of bugs (and hence rapidly led to 2.02 and 2.03), was specifically launched only to support the new Compaq 386.<query> when was os/2 presentation manager released</query> A couple of programmers were left to maintain it, but that was to have been - with it becoming nothing more than an interim development platform for OS/2 - to all intents and purposes the end of Windows. Steve Ballmer, a friend of Gates at Harvard, was persuaded to join Microsoft in 1980 - to, in effect, thereafter to become one of its founding fathers. Even so, he was seen as a weak strategist for a technology company. According to David Bank[xxv]at the time gates told his aides that that there was little chance Ballmer would ever become CEO. Of course, at the end of the 21990s Ballmer did eventually displace Gates as CEO; though who actually controls Microsoft is still an open question! In particular, at the earlier time, though, he very effectively reorganized Microsoft to get the right people in the right places.<query> who was steve ballmer</query> In addition, forced to become a reluctant head of sales and marketing, he was the closest of the founding partners to the needs of its customers. Skunkworks Unfortunately for IBM, Dave Weise - who couldn’t cope with working alongside IBM - argued his way back to the effectively defunct group. But this left him, with time on his hands, to pursue a pet project. The key to the future, for all operating systems, was to be able to run in 'protected mode' such that each application program could run alongside another but protected from it; its own code would not be corrupted by any others running on the machine. Around this time, Ballmer had wanted to buy Scroll Screen Tracer (SST) - a debugger developed by Murray Sargent, a brilliant physics professor from the University of Arizona - for use on its DOS work.<query> who created sst</query> Sargent, who was then on contract at Microsoft was persuaded to sell it, and spend the summer of ! 988 training Microsoft staff to use it and moving its own debugger into protect mode. This was when Weise met him, at a Microsoft party. Without any approval from Microsoft management, in the most celebrated form of skunkworks, the two of them - using Sargent's debugger - spent the next two weeks seeing how much of Windows they could hack into protect mode. In such unpredictable ways are corporate futures changed; without this one-man mission, the PC world would still be colored (OS/2) blue! Skunkworks…many of the most important breakthroughs come from unexpected sources. As already suggested, the key management ability is that of recognizing their importance. Again, those running creative management courses teach helpful techniques.<query> who invented the skunkworks</query> The result was that, at the August 1988 planning meeting, Weise (having wisely, forgive the pun, brought Ballmer in on the secret a few days earlier) sprang on Gates - along with the then fifteen man Windows team - not just the news that he had cracked the protect mode problem but actually demonstrated a working version of Windows using it. Even though he still thought OS/2 was the going to be the industry leader, Gates gave the go ahead for the new Windows project, and the legendary version 3.0 was on its way to launch twenty-one months later. Product Champions…the most important breakthroughs are often achieved by individuals who are so involved, indeed obsessed, that they will overcome all the odds - sometimes even going as far as to subvert the organization - to gain success for their 'baby'.<query> what year did windows os 2 come out</query> If you beat low objectives (as, for a long time, Bill Gates did) you are a hero. If you fail, even marginally (as IBM very publicly did), to meet higher objectives you are on the way out! Luck - thereafter, the next factor is luck. This is the one which is written very large on Bill Gates' CV. There is no easy way you can create this. Hard Work - on the other hand, the saying that by hard work (and Bill Gates has dedicated almost every waking minute to his own project) you can create your luck (or more accurately the opportunities for some luck to come your way) holds some truth. Ability - only comes last! Most performance management systems, however, assume the reverse, indeed that ability, coupled with hard work, is almost all that is needed!<query> what is the difference between hard work and ability</query> Academics recognize the role, which is akin to that of 'change agent' in the wider environment, but have few suggestions as to how they can be encouraged; and traditional managers find a host of ways to actively discourage them! Even though Gates thought it wouldn't harm the relationship with IBM, when the word finally leaked out to IBM, who quite reasonably thought they had eradicated Windows, all hell broke loose and they told Microsoft to kill the project. Accordingly, at the 1989 COMDEX Gates stood up and promised that - after the planned 1991 release of Windows 3.0 - Microsoft would cease development of it. ; leaving it for the low end of the market and OS/2 being the main PC operating system. Windows 3.0 The reality was that, launched in 1990, Windows 3.0 was an instant success; selling two million copies in the first six months.<query> when did windows ibm stop developing</query> As a result it took on a life of its own; and because of the work done by Microsoft's application groups - who were using it to test the move to OS/2 - their offerings (Word, Excel etc.) also walked over their competitors! Not least, Ashton-Tate's 'Word-Perfect' word processing package, which - despite all Gates' efforts to promote his own Word (whose disastrously bug-laden first version was still remembered) - had been the brand leader through the 1980s, moved too slowly and was soon overtaken; as eventually was Lotus in the spreadsheet market. Indeed, by 1998, the 'Office' desktop applications grossed more than $6 billion, compared with rather less than $5 billion for the Windows desktop platform[xxvi] . They had become the two best selling software products in history.<query> what year did word become the best selling software</query> In just two years Microsoft's stock-market value grew by 305% - reaching more than $20 billion by the end of 1991. According to Eller[xxvii], those inside Microsoft knew just what a fluke it had been, but the media - fed a diet by the publicists that insisted Microsoft was Gates - couldn't see it that way; and the legend was ratcheted up a notch. In turn his competitors believed it was a strategy born of his devilish cunning; all along he had planned to ditch OS/2 and give his own applications programs an unfair advantage. I tend to believe, like Eller, that - at this stage at least - it was an incredibly profitable cock-up not a well-judged conspiracy! It was only when Gates saw Windows 3.0 sell a million copies that he finally accepted - even then seeming to still want to follow IBM - it was a strategic product.<query> what was microsoft's strategy</query> Cultural Incompatibility…alliances often demand that shared taskforces are formed. If the two cultures are as different as those of Microsoft and IBM the result may be counter-productive. Again, those running creative management courses address this problem. Windows NT…mind you, even then he almost immediately switched his allegiance to Windows NT, which was rumored[xxviii] to have been started as a means of attracting one of DECs VMS architects; who wanted to continue working on mini-computer software. Based on the DEC architecture, unlike the mainstream Windows which still used large amounts of Intel 16-bit assembler code, NT was to be built from the ground up; to run on the whole range of machines (from PCs to mainframes, thus starting to deliver Gates' dream of global domination).<query> what was the purpose of windows nt</query> In the new range of products, his own PC based Windows was (once more) to be maintained, OS/2 was still to be the major new operating system for the PC, and NT (the key product) was to be the portable (between machines) platform of the future. Unfortunately, when - at the beginning of 1991 - the NT team presented their work, IBM noticed that it was all windows and no OS/2; and the long engagement was over before any children had been delivered. The loss of OS/2 also damaged Microsoft's networking and language developments, which had been based on it, throwing away several years of development work in the process. Even though it accounted for only a tenth of Microsoft's 'platform' business, Windows NT was to be Bill Gates' passport to the even more profitable business to be had from larger systems.<query> what was the nt operating system</query> Accordingly, throughout the 1990s, he threw resources at it. The first version, Windows NT, contained 6 million lines of code and needed a team of 250 developers at a cost of $150 million[xxix]. For later versions, the team expanded to more than 5,000 staff, producing nearly 30 million lines of code. Bill Gates eventually abandoned the 'Cairo' version, which was supposed to become his 'Windows Everywhere' and take over the world, to produce yet another version (which eventually was launched as Windows 2000) that was incompatible with the mainstream platform - but Bill Gates[xxx] proudly announced that it had cost of more than $3 billion, more than the Boeing 747 cost to develop! James Allchin, who was the head of the project, had been, once more in a typical manner, been recruited by Gates when he was considering buying Banyan, a specialist in networking, but realized that it was better - and far cheaper - to simply hire Allchin away from them instead!<query> what was the cost of the first windows</query> In a comment redolent of the IBM 360 gamble, he said ""We're obviously betting the company on it"". At the time, in terms of Microsoft's vicious internal politics, he was fighting for supremacy over the mainstream windows which he thought was a 'nice toy'[xxxi].Time will tell if his hype was well founded, and it really is as profitable an investment as the 360 was; or more like Concorde, a price paid for the developers ego! The Concorde Effect…the best developers are those who are product champions, dedicated to - indeed almost obsessed by - their new 'product'. With their blinkers on, they are however the worst people to decide on its value in the market-place! Windows 95…the new stand-alone version, which was eventually called Windows 95, was to be a very different affair.<query> what is the concorde effect</query> As it was now to become the star product, the development team grew until it eventually ran to over 500 names, matching the size of project team IBM had been wont to deploy. Making it a 32-bit system once more created major delays, though this time they had a sound alternative (Windows 3.0, with 140 million users) already in the field. It also signed up to strict protocols on debugging and testing; though this was the point at which they discovered the real magic of beta-testing, Some 400,000 users (adding up to something like 75 million hours of testing) signed up to use the code (laden, as it turned out, with 6,000 bugs) in advance of first delivery and paid $30 a copy for the privilege! In fact, 1990 seems to have been something of a turning point for Microsoft as a whole.<query> when did microsoft start beta testing</query> Before that time its history had depended on a great deal of luck; as indeed was the unexpected success of Windows 3.0. Thereafter it turned itself into a much more conventional organization; much less dependent on chance for its success. In particular, Nathan Myhrvold was put in charge of its research and development work[xxxii]. As we saw above, he recruited literally hundreds of new developers to work on Windows, in order to rectify Microsoft's previous tendency to ship bug-laden first and second versions - only getting the product right the third time around!. Macintosh At that earlier time, Microsoft had also been working with Apple to port its applications to the new GUI (Graphical User Interface) machine, the Macintosh. In view of the obvious conflict of interest, Gates had been forced to create a 'Chinese Wall' between the two sets of developers; though it proved to be a very leaky one - not least because its senior managers, who knew all about the Mac, straddled the two (and were captivated by the Mac).<query> who was the first person to work on windows</query> The day the Mac was introduced, in January 1984, Gates reportedly told MacGregor to go out and buy one so it could be reverse-engineered. He did not see any conflict of interest, and did not apparently[xxxiii] want this to squash Apple, as he had done VisiCorp. It is claimed that he merely wanted to ensure the Microsoft applications running on the IBM PC were brought into line with those on the Apple Mac; for efficiencies sake It is a nice story, but it would be the first, and last, time Gates indulged in such niceties! In any case, apparently without understanding how the Mac system worked [xxxiv] (a strange lack given his passion for software), and in particular that it was incompatible with their own windows code, Gates told the Windows team to also incorporate the Mac features; which caused yet another massive delay - said to be more than seven months.<query> when was the first mac introduced</query> L'Etat C'est Moi On the other hand, unlike IBM which has long been a corporate identity, Microsoftis Bill Gates; it would be nothing without him - and that stark contrast with IBM is also part of the fascination of his role in the context of this book. So for the record, William Henry Gates III was born in 1995 - in Seattle where he still lives - to wealthy parents; with a socially-prominent, and doting, mother whose interventions played a significant role in many of the key developments in his life. He reportedly[ii] talked to her as many as three times a day even through later life. Unlike almost all other commentators, however, John Heilemann[iii] suggests it was his lawyer father who was most influential; and indeed being steeped in the law may have later caused his son to later behave unwisely at Microsoft's anti-trust trial.<query> where was bill gates born</query> Billionaire Bill Gates, as we all now know, went on to become the world's wealthiest individual - becoming a billionaire as early as 1986 when he was just 31 years old - and in the process created between 1,000 and 3,000 employee millionaire employees (depending upon which estimate you take), though that number may have significantly diminished after the dot.com crash which cut Wall Street's valuation of Microsoft by a third. He has been, with a degree of self-interest, generous to his key employees in this way. Even so, Microsoft's management style has been described as Darwinian - survival of the fittest[xxxv]. Bill Gates seems to thrive on conflict, as much within Microsoft as outside it. He is, again according to Janet Lowe[xxxvi], ""…known for being confrontational, rude and condescending ""; characteristics which did not help his case (or his image in the media) when he appeared before the judge in the Anti-Trust trial at the end of the 1990s.<query> who is bill gates</query> In particular, he has a low tolerance for those whose intellect he does not respect. When he throws a tantrum his favourite phrase seems to be "" …this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of…""[xxxvii] At such times he is hyperactive and literally screams at his staff, before quietening down and rocking rhythmically back and forth in his chair! On the other hand, as (reported by Janet Lowe again[xxxviii]) one developer said "" …you have to understand we're all adolescents. And proud of it. "" But he (perhaps helped by his billions) is still seen as a charismatic leader who inspires his dedicated workers. Much of the good news is, though, hype put out by his spin doctors. Thus, in particular, his widely reported donations to charity are often rather less than they may seem.<query> who is the developer</query> In total up to 1997, Gates gave away just $70 million; less than a third of one per cent of his total net worth. Microsoft's subsequent 1997 claim that it had donated $73.2 million in cash and software was revealed to be 85% software - valued at retail prices (even though the cost to Microsoft was probably less than one per cent of this) - and even this (given to a school or library) was best seen as promotional support rather than charity[xxxix]! A number of the subsequent 'donations' are also best viewed as promotional activities. Gates' excuse is that ""I don't have time to figure out what charities make sense""[xl] - and presumably he also doesn't have time either to appoint an adviser who would have the time! Underdog For years, during its battle with IBM, Microsoft was seen as the underdog It even carried this underdog image with it when it became the market leader.<query> how much money did bill gates give away</query> It was only at the end of 1997, having already been in court since 1996, when the US Justice Department's prosecution case really started, that its reputation turned around and it became the target for the near hate which now sometimes envelops it! The fact that it had brazenly defied the previous order placed on it in 1995, requiring it to offer its Internet Explorer separately, clearly did not help. More important, for its competitors, Microsoft is determined to keep proprietary control - under the law - of all IT standards, and has done so far more effectively than IBM ever did. Its methods have sometimes been, however, questionable. For example, having signed up to adopt the Sun Microsystems Java language for use on its Windows and NT systems, the version it actually released was not compatible with the original standard; and once more fought it out in the courts.<query> what is microsoft's proprietary control</query> It has also been criticised for releasing substandard products just to get to market before its competitors; but, according to Des Dearlove[xli], Gates has said that ""…getting to market with a good or OK product first is better than getting there second with a great product ."" Control of Standards…if you can gain control of the standards which operate in a market, and especially if you can achieve something of a monopoly as IBM once did and more recently Microsoft has done, you can shape the demands of that market to favor your own offerings. Academics, especially economists, encounter difficulty in dealing with markets which experience imperfect competition - as most do! Strategy As - in the later 1990s - the markets for operating systems moved into new areas, especially in consumer goods such as digital televisions, Bill Gates promoted his 'vision' of 'Widows Everywhere': with compatibility across the whole range of devices.<query> who said that it is better to get to market first or second</query> This was to be developed by Allchin's group working on Windows NT, by then the ultimately aborted Cairo project which finally become Windows 2000. This represented, in Bill Gates' eyes, thefuture: allowing him to enter the profitable large systems market. Ranged against them, however, were Silverberg's team working on Chicago; which in turn would become Windows 95 - consolidating Microsoft's hold on its core business with end-users. Silverberg was very market-oriented, giving users what they wanted; and his staff, largely made up of graduate recruits, saw themselves as 'pirates' dedicated to creating 'cool' new features[xlii]! Earlier in Microsoft's history this competition between groups might have proved productive, in much the same way that IBM at its peak funded competing developments and then chose the best of them.<query> who developed windows 97</query> But, in the 1990s as it matured to become a large bureaucracy, the splits between the two groups started to cause major tensions within the company. They didn't communicate well with each other, not least because Silverberg saw the job of the NT team as being 'to kill Windows 95'[xliii]; which was, indeed, its hidden agenda! In the later 1990s an even more crucial split appeared. This was between the Windows developers in general, who were at the heart of the company, and those who wanted to respond to the new - rapidly growing - demands of the Internet. Bill Gates was, of course, amongst the former; since his 'Windows' had spent most of the last decade building the 'lock' on its users that he saw as the source of Microsoft's massive profits.<query> who was the microsoft company</query> The users were happy using it and - most important - they found it very difficult to give it up and switch to something else! It was the 'hard-drug' of the software industry, where persuading its users to undergo any 'cold turkey' was an almost impossible task for Microsoft's competitors. Accordingly, over the years - despite the ease of maintenance which would be the result - Microsoft had never simplified its code and had added on extra new features to strength its lock on users. Cold Turkey…if you can build in a high level of migration costs, so that customers think it is not worth the costs of changing to achieve marginally better results and they are not too annoyed by poor service, your 'product' can build a very stable set of customers; and, if you are the brand leader, build towards something very like a monopoly!<query> why was microsoft never a cold turkey</query> Unfortunately, the Internet was essentially simple; and was, as such, seen by Bill Gates as a major threat to his security blanket of 'lock-ins'. But the Internet was already attracting the attention of the many 'independent' software providers on whom Microsoft relied for writing the applications which its customers used. It was at this stage, therefore, the Bill Gates finally got interested - especially in Netscape which was rapidly becoming everyone's favourite. Unable to buy that company, his usual solution, Bill Gates response inevitably was to order his developers to reverse-engineer it and then add unique features an content to build the lock-in again. The hidden effect, which ultimately became more important, was that, for once, Bill Gates was forced to embrace open-standards; those of the Internet.<query> why was bill gates forced to embrace open standards</query> Of course, it would also extend them, to - as its competitors claimed - 'engulf and devour' them! Even the Windows desktop was to become a web-page. It also highlighted another major split within Microsoft. By then its developers had begun to feel that their new ideas were being pushed aside in the name of 'strategy'. Bill Gates had been demanding ever tighter lock-ins - to push users towards its own applications. Bosworth voiced these frustrations [xliv]: ""Before 1996 the entrepreneurs ruled Microsoft…[it] was filled with people who had to compete against entrenched winners and won…The organization was built for that"". But, he added, the new bureaucratic limitations - demanded by the 'profit maximization' model Bill Gates had created - was stifling all that and demoralizing staff.<query> what was the purpose of the microsoft organization before 1996</query> As a teenager, though, encouraged by his mother and possibly living up to the example of his great-grandfather who had founded Seattle's National City Bank, he undoubtedly showed a precocious intellect at an early age - not least in mathematics - and even as a teenager was seen as a bona fide computer nerd (or geek, which he still is!). Perhaps not unexpectedly, one of his heroes as a teenager was Holden Caulfield from 'Catcher in the Rye'[iv], passages from which he was still reciting to girlfriends when he was well into his thirties[v]; though in later life his great hero seems to have become Leonardo da Vinci - perhaps because he identifies with him! On the other hand, he was a most unusual teenager - even for the money obsessed West Coast - in that he was - above all - preoccupied (indeed obsessed) with turning a profit on whatever he touched.<query> who was holden caulfield</query> The main argument, however, then focused on whether Microsoft should be developing a (separate) new Internet platform or integrating it with Windows. Unfortunately the legal arguments in the anti-trust case meant that Bill Gates had state that integration was a necessity; and the die was cast! Up until then the board of Microsoft had always deferred to Gates, for he had been the company's single focus of control. Now, as they saw it, this 'focus' was also becoming its single point of failure. Windows 2000 was losing its battle against complexity and other products were being delayed. According to David Bank[xlv], based on the email evidence uncovered in the anti-trust trial, Gates was losing control! In 1998, therefore, he handed business responsibility to Ballmer - who he had once said would never become CEO - and then in January finally allowed him to have the full title of CEO.<query> who was the ceo of microsoft</query> Again according to David Banks[xlvi], Bill Gates' explanation for moving to 'Chief Software Architect', that he wanted to spend more time with its product groups, caused alarm amongst these! They feared he would disrupt their efforts, where the previous advice from their functional management had been to keep Gates as far away from their work as possible. In the event, Ballmer proved just as centrist as gates, demanding to be the focus of decision-making one every issue; a major problem where he, like Bill Gates before him, managed by controlling the detail rather than by setting strategic objectives. In any case, Bill Gates - now supposedly thinking two to five years ahead - is still the one real central focus in Microsoft, and is still seen as its 'brand image' (albeit an increasingly unattractive one) to the outside world.<query> why did bill gates move to microsoft</query> The main problem for Microsoft may now be that it has lost its intense focus on Windows, which had driven it for the previous decade. As set out for employees in 2001, Ballmer stated that there were to beseven key businesses (including .NET, Office, Server Software, MSN),two priorities for staff (keeping customers and delivering the new platform) andthree things the company must do well (meet priorities, cut costs and focus on its people). Microsoft was starting to look like IBM in the worst days of John Aker's rule! Visionary? Gates' spin-doctors plug him as being a great visionary. But he didn't invent DOS, it was IBM who brought him to that, and his most successful product Windows, the key elements of which were derived from the technological breakthroughs of others, has succeeded despite his decades long attempts to kill it.<query> what was the main problem with microsoft</query> In many respects, therefore, Gates is best characterized as the luckiest man alive or at least the world's most successful opportunist. Thus, displaying a peculiar, and continuing, blindness over the future of IT communications, he missed the development of LANs (Local Area Networks) and lost software leadership there to Novell (something that, despite his public bad-mouthing of the Novell software) he once thought was his greatest mistake [xlvii] and has twice tried to buy [xlviii]. Indeed, despite all the hype, he has relatively poor strategic vision. Although his much hyped 1995 book about the future (which talked more about his new house and his passion for encryption than what faces the rest of us as a result of his machinations), mentioned the Internet (which some of the commentators have mistakenly said it didn't), Gates predicted that this would only be a minor part of the overall 'superhighway', which was the focus of his attention at the time; ""The growth of the Internet over the past few years suggests that highway applications will quickly become extremely popular and justify large investments…It's a long way from being the highway, but it's the closest approximation we have today, and will evolve into the highway ""[xlix].<query> who is the luckiest man alive</query> How embarrassingly short-sighted can a futurist be! In fact, as usual for Gates, his interest in the whole field of electronic networking had been stimulated by the arrival of what he saw as a major new competitor: AOL. The result was the development by Microsoft, from early 1993 onwards, of an on-line system, Marvel, which soon became Microsoft Network and then just MSN. It was a closed system, however, mimicking AOL, rather than peer-to-peer as the Internet was - and as Myhrvold was wisely recommending at the time. AOL At this point I will indulge in another diversion, into that part of the field of Business-To-Consumer (B2C), and especially Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) networking, now dominated by AOL.<query> what was microsoft network</query> It is a diversion, in the context of this book, since it is now not directly relevant to Microsoft, or even IBM which - apart from its disastrous adventure with Prodigy (its own AOL contender) - has steadfastly stayed with Business-To-Business (B2B) markets. It is important, however, because in the longer term, albeit perhaps not for a decade or more, C2C networking is likely to become the biggest market of all. Microsoft, despite its dependence on the mistakes of others combined with a generous measure of luck for its success, still follows many of the traditional approaches to business. On the other hand, AOL seems to have lived life in the fast-lane dependentonly on luck! What is more, it seems to have succeeded despite a vision in which its main business has often been seen by it as merely peripheral!<query> why is microsoft a good business</query> In much the same way that the precursor of IBM was first created by Charles R Flint, the precursor of AOL was initially set up as early as 1978 by another 'serial' company builder Bill Von Meister; as a home information utility, 'The Source'. Unlike Flint, though, most of Von Meister's efforts failed spectacularly; and 'The Source', running out of funds, was soon sold to Reader's Digest; and eventually ended up as part of Compuserve (which was, in turn bought by AOL - thus closing the circle!). Only AOL achieved significant success; and then not for another decade, long after Von Meister left - to die penniless. Foreshadowing the interest in the entertainment business which - despite the reality of its customer base and revenue streams - has since seemed to represent the most important focus of AOL's own vision of its future, Von Meister's next venture was the 'Home Music Store' selling popular music down the line.<query> who created aol</query> Like Napster, two decades later, this was predictably destroyed by opposition from the record industry! Von Meister then set out on another new 'entertainment' venture. This time it was in on-line video games which - spurred on by sales of millions of Atari consoles - were the flavor of the month in the early 1980s. Launched at the 1883 CES show in Las Vegas, the new venture was called the control Video Corporation, CVC, and was funded by - amongst others - Dan Case. The product, the 'Gameline Master Module' which attached to the Atari (though Atari had refused to support the operations), was initially a hit with the venture capitalists. Perhaps more important, it brought in, as a consultant and then full-time employee, Steve Case. He was Dan's brother and was to dominate the later development of AOL, as had Thomas Watson Sr. that of IBM.<query> who was steve case</query> Unlike others in the industry - who (like Bill Gates) started life as IT specialists - but like Thomas Watson Sr., Steve Case's career to that point to that point had been in marketing; though classically, for the age of mass marketing, as an assistant brand manager at P&G and then manager of new product development at Pizza Hut. Surprisingly, considering his marketing background and unlike Gates, Case has adopted a low key image. He has said[l] ""In my case it really is about believing that there is work to be done to build a medium that we can be proud of…It's not about so-called power; or visibility or stature. These are things I don't particularly enjoy."" He has been described by The Washington Post[li] as ""…the technocrat politician more than the entrepreneur.."" which then added ""This approach…may be betters suited to long terms success"" and significantly, in contrast with Bill Gates, ""He integrates a lot of views when he's making decisions…"" Another reporter at The Washington Post[lii] categorized him as ""…half nerd and half marketing guru…He's enough of a nerd to be really into online services but he has all the marketing skills to understand how to make it work."" Von Meister's bad luck held once more.<query> who is steve case</query> The bottom dropped out of the video games market almost as soon as CVC had been launched, he was on his way out once more and Bob Cross was brought in to turn the company around. But salvation was no easy task for, in 1984, it was said that ""the company had no clear product, no apparent market, no real money[liii]"". The real salvation, perhaps, was the investment by Jim Kismet who had previously made his fortune by opening a chain of singles bars. It also relied on a deal with the Bell South telephone company. The new product, a modem for home use, once more failed to ignite interest; and Bell South, joining the lengthening line of punters who had lost their shirts backing Von Meister, lost its money. To avoid bankruptcy, the business was transferred to a new company with yet more new founders, Quantum Computer Services, which was to provide private (Q-Link) online services for Commodore customers.<query> who started cvc</query> His mother's first defining influence, though, came when the 'Mother's Club' at his private school set up a fund to provide the students with time on a large (General Electric owned) mainframe computer and then at CCC (Computer Center Corporation) where the 'Mother's Club arranged for them to use its new DEC computer after hours - in return for searching out programming errors in its software. Spurred on by the irresistible opportunity this presented to him, he was soon became one of the early hackers invading various other computer systems; demonstrating early a disdain of the law which seems to have stayed with him - if the Anti-Trust proceedings are anything to go by. Recently, though, the only penalties he seems to have racked up are the speeding tickets he has earned around Seattle in his range of fast cars!<query> who was the first computer hacker</query> Thiswas, a decade or more down the line, to become AOL. But growth in revenue was slow. By 1986 there were only 10,000 customers and revenue in 1987 was only $8.6 million; although for once they did make a small profit! Indeed, as Commodore's fortunes declined, they needed to find a new platform. It couldn't be IBM, since that was locked into Prodigy - and indeed was relaunching this. So, the choice was Apple, which was to receive a 10 per cent royalty on sales. Although this brought larger numbers of customers, Quantum eventually felt itself too cramped by the marketing constraints it involved. In the resulting break-up Apple also joined the lengthening line of partners which had lost money - in this case including $2.5 million to buy back the rights to its own logo!<query> what year did apple break up</query> This, in 1989, was the point at which the name of the service (but not the holding company) was finally changed to America Online, which offered much the same private online services; though now across the whole market - including IBM users. By 1991, however, AOL was to ready to become a 'legitimate' business. Previously it had lived almost as a serial 'scam'; persuading a range of individuals and organizations to bet their shirts, and then lose them, on very borderline ventures. Indeed, Kara Swisher, in her very comprehensive book about AOL (AOL.COM[liv]), summarizes this feature very 'positively' as "" …throughout its volatile history, one of AOL's greatest strengths - and also the subject of later criticism - has been its ability to fund itself through a variety of innovative and controversial methods…[for] its business operations never threw off enough cash to cover the costs of its growth."" Scam Entrepreneurs…small start-ups are often more dependent on selling their ideas to investors than to consumers.<query> when did aol become legit</query> They typically need 'venture capitalists' to fund them. Some of these, such as Flint at IBM and Markula at Apple, are legitimate - even if they do at times sail close to edge of legality. Some, such as Von Meister, can be more reminiscent of Mel Brooks' 'Producers'. Whichever the type, however, there is always considerable risk involved, the odds are against such small ventures, entrepreneurs - along with potential investors - should think long and hard before they jump! Even that part of management thinking devoted to SME's (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) tends to optimistically ignore the risk of failure. Now, though, it had something genuinely worthwhile to promote. Indeed, even Compuserve, which had been growing its consumer online service for hobbyist computer users - based on its interactive computer bulletin boards (though its main strength became its financial and computer data) - and which had bought The Source (with its 53,000 members) to add to the half a million of its own, now wanted to get hold of Quantum's 110,000 members - and eventually offered $50 million for the company.<query> what type of venture is a sme</query> But that was below the $60 million which its management saw as the very minimum it was worth, so the sale fell through - and, of course, AOL later returned the favor by actually buying Compuserve! Its name, changed to AOL for the company as well as the offering, was now becoming known but sales growth was still slow. Even so, in 1992, it went public on NASDAQ; only to suffer the attentions of Paul G Allen, cofounder of Microsoft, who steadily acquired its stock. Even Bill Gates made an approach; though his characteristic opening gambit, ""I can buy 20 per cent of you or I can buy all of you. Or I can go into this business myself and bury you [lv]"", virtually killed that deal on the spot; though Case only won the subsequent vote on AOL's board by one vote[lvi]!<query> who bought aol</query> The company possibly was now, in 1993, worth around $400 million - having multiplied its value sevenfold in two years. Bill Gates, in turn, went on to try and bury it with MSN; but, for once, signally failed to do so. Having beaten of Gates, and having come to terms with Allen, Steve Case was at last allowed to emerge and make a marketing advantage out of AOL's flexibility: ""From the early days, we recognized that communications - a combination of chat and e-mail - were critical building blocks…So our bias was on creating tools, empowering people, and letting then use them in any way they thought appropriate - sort of 'Let a thousand flowers bloom'[lvii] "". AOL had, at long last, settled on the formula which was to make it a power in the land.<query> who is steve case</query> Unlike the 'seriousness' of Compuserve and the IBM dominated 'family' atmosphere of Prodigy, the freedom of expression offered by the AOL service attracted subscribers; even if much of the chat was sex-oriented (and that posed major problems with the industry regulators later in the 1990s when something like half its business was still sexually oriented!). In addition, using the icon-based approach it had been forced to develop when it served Apple, it was easy to use (and install, taking only five minutes for this) - and, unlike Compuserve and Prodigy, it now could be fully used on either Apple or Windows. Newsweek[lviii] summed it up as ""By hosting hundreds of chat rooms, sponsoring the most popular instant messaging service on the globe and giving granny an e-mail address she'd never figure out how to change, AOL kept its audience and saw growth accelerated by the Network Effect (the more people who sign up, the more valuable the service)."" It is this latter aspect, in particular, which we believe will be the key to future value.<query> why is aol so popular</query> Owning Members…C2C (Consumer-To-Consumer) networking will eventually become just about the most profitable ecommerce market. Ownership of its members will then be the key to value for portals; and the financial markets are already in effect putting a value per member - at the peak of the dot.com boom it was something like $15,000 for each AOL members. As yet, though ecommerce is a strange new land for business academics! The product was now right, and the newly hired Jan Brandt took the most important, albeit also the riskiest, marketing step AOL ever made. She started the carpet-bombing of America with free AOL software disks - ultimately sending out 250 million of these! This was the ultimate in sampling, giving the millions of recipients immediate access; with free hours of usage and waiver of the first month's fee.<query> how much does aol cost per member</query> It was a classic marketing success; in that 10 per cent of those receiving the disks used them for a free trial of the service. Over the years from 1992 to 1996, the 25 million free trials then turned into 5 million members[lix]. Sampling…the most effective device for persuading potential new customers to but your product or service is to let them sample it. Otherwise the significant step they have to make is to buy the 'product' just to see if it works for them. This trial offer is just important in B2B and services. Indeed, despite the popular image of samples plopping onto the doormat, internet services (which can, without costs to themselves or their prospective customers, offer a free trial - limited by a time-out) are likely to become the most important users of this approach.<query> why is it important to offer a free trial</query> Management theorists tend to lump sampling together with other forms of promotion, most of which are usually price discounts in one form or another, which misses the point. Even though the response generated problems with AOL's service response times, and clogged its lines, by mid 1994 AOL had a million members on line. Just as important, as Kara Swisher reports, ""…its share price was red hot, and most of its purchases [of companies taken over] could be made with its stock as currency. Over the next year, AOL would use the stock market to literally print money - in the form of AOL shares."" In one of its first moves subsequently, it bought 'Bookline' to be its browser - only later to be replaced by the much bigger acquisition of Netscape.<query> when did aol buy netscape</query> It also acquired Advanced Network & Services Inc (ANS) to build its communications network. It also started to build a stable of companies creating interactive material, buying stakes in them or entering into joint ventures; as new content creation became its vehicle for brand building. To service its new 'channels, deliberately modeled on television to make it look like a media company, it also created its own 'in-house content studio', and had potential providers make pitches to it as producers did to the film studios! The first winners included 'Motley Fool', the irreverent - but very successful - financial site. Once again running short of funds, it worked its magic with another public offering; and at the end of 1995 its fortunes seemed to be set fair. But the world was moving to the internet and AOL's 'closed network' offering started to look stale - until, seemingly against all the odds (but eliminating Justice Department problems), Bill Gates offered to put the AOL registration icon on the Windows desktop; albeit not as prominently displayed as that of MSN.<query> what was the first aol</query> Early on, however, he was caught by the CCC security officers when his hacking activities crashed the mainframe. He has said that he then ""…swore off computers for a year and a half…I tried to be normal[vi]"", though Janet Lowe[vii] (perhaps with more conviction) insists it was his mother who, worried that this distraction might cause him to fail his schoolwork, ordered him to stop! She might have had a point, because he later dropped out of Harvard to start the company which afterwards became Microsoft. We now move on therefore, to the part of his life story which was enmeshed with that of IBM. IBM Bearing True Gifts Clearly the most important turning point, in this context, was the initial decision which ultimately made Bill Gates a billionaire; personally worth, on paper at least, something like $6 billion by the beginning of the 1990s.<query> what year did bill gates become microsoft</query> At the same time, however, AOL brought in Netscape to replace 'Bookline' as its own browser; though it didn't buy it until 1999 - for $4.2 billion -- by which time its deal with Microsoft had become much less important. By 1996, AOL was worth $6.5 billion[lx], up 15,000 per cent in just two years, and had - once more against the odds - beaten Microsoft in the online wars of the previous year. But it was becoming the victim of 'churn' amongst its customer base, losing members almost as fast as it signed up new ones (at a cost to it of $50 each); and this also fatally damaged the AOL accounting practice of amortizing its customer acquisition costs over two years. Even worse, its competitors, including the new ISPs which were entering the business, were starting to offer unlimited usage deals - where AOL made its money from the hourly usage charges!<query> when did aol buy netscape</query> It was forced to introduce a flat rate offering; at $19.95 for 20 hours use. The panic amongst its investors knocked nearly 70 per cent off its value. The situation was compounded by the technical problems AOL was experiencing in servicing its more than 6 million customers. This was highlighted by a widely publicized system outage, for almost 19 hours, in August 1996; and AOL was forced to invest $250 million (eventually more than $350 million) in its communications network. Worse was to come. AOL lost $353.7 million in the first quarter of 1987, when it had to write off its deferred subscriber acquisition costs. In 1997, to improve profitability, AOL started to charge its content partners for access to its now very valuable customer base. In 1998 it, at long last, acquired Compuserve; whose AOL copycat, Wow, had failed miserably.<query> when did aol start charging for content</query> In any case, despite its 2.6 million members, Compuserve was regularly making losses. The deal was, once more, innovative - with AOL 'buying' Compuserve from WorldCom as a swap for AOL's ANS subsidiary (which, though successful, had been getting in the way of AOL's relations with the other communications networks). AOL even got $185 million in cash! Its stock jumped 600 per cent in 1998 alone! The icing on the cake came when at the end of the 1990s, its miraculously escalating stock market valuation - having multiplied almost a thousandfold over the decade - allowed it to buy Time-Warner. This was one of the great media corporations, with - as IBM once had - a successful track-record stretching back almost a century. This was a fairy tale come true, though whether the Time-Warner kiss will turn the frog, that AOL still is, into anything else is yet to be seen.<query> who bought compuserve</query> In some respects it smacked of the 'water' that IBM's Flint had added to his deals, though Wall Street - lusting for the dot.com boom to come and very aware of the 30 million members (ten times as many as MSN) AOL now had - was a very willing partner. In many respects it took AOL back to its roots, as an online entertainment provider which it had long wanted to be; and possibly took its attention away from the online customer services base which was its real strength. More worryingly for the resulting conglomerate, it produced a corporation which was straddling two very different markets - entertainment through cable and communications through the internet - which were proving impossible to merge. Pyramid Builders…we can all sneer at the housewives who foolishly get caught up in chain letter scams. Yet the most foolish of all are those in the financial markets who are happy to accept the inflated values set by those who create pyramids of businesses where paper profits are hidden by the takeovers themselves at one extreme and by the Byzantine mazes of globalized accounting systems at the other - all nicely wrapped up in creatively accounted packages! Management educators do not warn their students that the biggest confidence tricks of all can be played on the financial markets.<query> what is the aol pyramid</query> I have also talked a great deal about customers at IBM and Microsoft, but AOL really us different because these are ongoing members; and they are much more important to it than its staff. Even so, it is worth recording that its culture is supposedly[lxi] a mix of Apple's enthusiasm and dedication to its product with Microsoft's work ethic and competitive nature. In particular, though, its dress code was definitelyvery casual! The Internet Proper Reverting to the Microsoft story, in 1993 - after his rebuff by AOL - Bill Gates started to build its own online offering to compete with it, which eventually became MSN. It, of course, had the major advantage of being given pride of place on the Windows desktop; though its use of the Windows folder approach made it much less approachable than AOL's.<query> what is aol's culture</query> Furthermore, its launch slipped as did that of Windows 95, to which it was tied and by which it was also overshadowed. In the event it managed to sign up nearly 200,000 users in the first two weeks, but then - lacking heavyweight promotional support - its growth stagnated; whilst AOL at the same time was bringing 250,000 new users every month. In the event, MSN reportedly[lxii] lost $500 million in two years. It was not until the end of 1995 that Microsoft ported MSN to the Web. Indeed, Bill Gateswas very late recognizing the true potential offered by the Internet. The story[lxiii] is that suddenly in May 1995, having spent 10 hours browsing the Internet and finding almost no Microsoft standard file formats (but lots of those from competitors), he issued a directive which said ""I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features "".<query> when did microsoft start using the internet</query> Previously he had, instead, focused his teams solely on the 'grand convergence of television and computers'[lxiv] (the then media mogul's, incorrect, cable/megastream view of the future of the 'Superhighway'), even though he already had a team developing a technically similar (low-bandwidth) Remote Information Protocol (RIP) for the 'home' - code-named Homer, it was to control all the devices (from lights and heating to washing machines and television) around the home. Gates killed off this advanced consumer technology group's (low-bandwidth) work in 1992, apparently without ever realizing the coming importance of the Internet! Long Range Forecasting…the most powerful technique for exploring the future over the longer term, beyond ten years ahead in general (but possibly less than half that in the very fast-moving high-tech industries) is scenario forecasting. A number of management textbooks, including my own, cover the subject of scenarios in some depth.<query> what is the most powerful technique for exploring the future over the long term?</query> The end result, where his directive[lxv] also said ""…with a major goal to get OEMs shipping our browser preinstalled"", was all the legal trouble he brought on himself when he later tried (otherwise successfully) to recover his position by destroying Netscape, which had actually implemented something like RIP. At the time, his own browser, a separate application called Explorer 1.0, was licensed from Spyglass (the company which had bought Marc Andreessen's previous Mosaic browser code - the precursor to his later Netscape) and Microsoft then sold copies of it for $50 - even though it had often been given away free as shareware over the Internet. Just, but only just, living up to its name Windows 95 was launched at the end of 1995. The outcome of Gates' Internet oversight was, however, that Windows 95 was overshadowed at the 1995 COMDEX by the new kid on the block: Netscape!<query> what year was windows 95 released</query> Once again, the next version - Windows 98 - was to be the interim product just supporting new hardware; leading the way now to NT. To add something to persuade users to switch, they added the Explorer 4.0 shell to the core product[lxvi] - finally inviting the unwelcome attention of the Justice Department! Tensions The split between its two incompatible systems continued into the 21st century, however, with Windows 98 moving on to become Windows Millennium Edition, still with much of its code written in Intel's 16-bit assembler[lxvii] with Windows 2000 still based on DEC architecture! XML…Up until the late 1990s, Bill Gates had insisted that Windows was the main, indeed almost the only, offering which really mattered. At that time, however, the advent of the Internet posed a genuine - if very unwelcome - challenge to Windows domination; even within Microsoft itself.<query> what was the first version of windows</query> Even as late as 1997, Bill Gates lacerated the Java team for failing to protect Windows, stating:""Why don't you just give up your [stock] options and join the Peace Corps?…Haven't you ever heard of Windows? Windows is what this company is about![lxviii]"". On the other hand, the development group under Bosworth - who had (unusually) negotiated a guarantee of independence from Bill Gates - was responding to the new demand for XML; a cross-platform development from the basic HTML language which made it possible for software applications to work together regardless of the underlying platform. On the basis of some stealth, not least by covertly persuading IBM and Oracle to also support it and boosted by the collapse of a competitive development within Microsoft, in June 2000 it made XML the focus of its Internet offering.<query> what was the xml language</query> More important, for the tale of IBM's woes, it handed the control of the PC operating system to him! As we have seen elsewhere, there was a degree of inevitability that PC group would look outside for an operating system. As a small IBU, with very limited resources (to match its limited targets) and impossible timescales, it had to 'buy-in' these things; and in any case the philosophy (enshrined in the then popular management theory as 'make or buy') was very much in vogue with IBM senior management. PC group was to be congratulated by them, at the time, for their initiative; and many other parts of IBM were encouraged to follow suit - though, fortunately perhaps, few did. What may seem less understandable, even with hindsight, is why IBM chose Microsoft.<query> why did ibm choose microsoft</query> In Bill Gates' eyes it was still 'disruptive technology, which threatened the existing products in the market and especially his own 'lock-ins', but by then there was no alternative. Microsoft, for once, would have to win by being the best! Yet again, thousands of its developers were drafted in for this work. When this happened, the best developers - who liked the freedom of working in small groups - again left the company. Where previously they would have been welcomed to the band of its independent software providers, however, they were this time treated with hostility and had to work for its competitors - hardly a wise move by Microsoft! Disruptive Technologies…this is now one of the 'in-phrases' amongst business leaders, but all it means is that radical new technologies can threaten the sitting tenants in markets, so they - and you - must keep looking over your shoulder to see what is coming up on you.<query> what is disruptive technology</query> If you know about it, with your position in the market and the resources this generates, you can usually counter it. .NET…Having finally got Windows 2000 out of the door, Microsoft started in its significant change in direction. The new offering was not to be the software in a package, as Windows was, but software provided as an Internet-based service. After considerable soul-searching, and after Bill Gates had finally been persuaded not to include 'Windows' in the name, the title Dot. Net (.NET) was chosen. The pressure to once more integrate everything to do with the Internet under this banner returned. Bill Gates saw .NET, using XML, once more as proprietary: ""What we do is take standards and drive forward.[lxix]"": in exactly the same way that he captured the market for PC operating systems.<query> what is.net</query> He, once more, invited in the usual range of 'partners', but made it clear that Microsoft would keep the high volume parts of the service to itself. Bill Gates was back, with a vengeance, in a form of business he really understood. This time, though, these 'partners' and their customers proved less willing to put their trust in Gates; and this weakened the whole package! The Battle for the Internet As yet, AOL is winning the war for 'content'. On the other hand, the battle for the future if Internet operating systems is far from decided. On the one hand there is .NET, now Microsoft's chosen offering: with which (using Microsoft's better development tools) it is easy to create web services, use XML and write in most languages - but can only run on one operating system (once more Windows!).<query> what is the battle for the internet</query> On the other, there is Java, backed by Microsoft's competitors - in particular IBM and Sun - in order to break the Windows monopoly; favored by IT managers in that it is reliable, secure and scalable, and can run on any popular operating system. But it has fewer development tools and is the only language available, even in the cases of J2EE - Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition - which dominates the corporate market. Although Java was developed as a proprietary modular system (made up of 'beans' which could be combined in various ways to make the most efficient code)by Sun, it is now effectively an open standard where, in line with his core (lock-in) philosophy. Bill Gates tightly controls the proprietary .NET. According to The Economist[lxx] ""Even if Microsoft is contained by antitrust remedies .NET is likely to reign supreme on the PC - but not in the entire consumer market.<query> what is java language</query> Java has taken hold in set-top boxes and mobile phones which now outnumber PCs. In the corporate market J2EE will probably dominate. But many small businesses will choose .NET because they want to spend less and still find it simple to get everything from one vendor."" Perhaps the real difference is that, for the first time in more than a decade, in these new markets Microsoft is not the clear leader - let alone dominant - instead it is the challenger. It will once more have to play the role of David against Goliath, which was so popular with its customers in the 1980s but which will now be - after the revelations of the anti-trust trial - much less believable! Despite its history with Windows, it is even demanding open standards - which is a much more believable demand coming from its new competitor, Linux, which is not just open standard but is freeware!<query> what is the difference between java and linux</query> Linux In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Microsoft's competitors - most notable and, belatedly, IBM - had tried to promote Unix as their preferred competitive operating system. Unfortunately, each of the suppliers had produced systems which were incompatible with each other. Bill Gates could justifiably claim, even with the split caused by Windows NT, that for most of the market his offering offered a true single standard. All that changed when Linux, a variant on Unix, was developed as 'freeware'. Thus, anyone could take the core (kernel) of the operating system without charge, as long as they accepted its standards. Soon, thousands of programmers around the world were adding their own code to make Linux ever more powerful. Most important, as 'open-source' (written in code which was publicly available), everyone could inspect and test the code; so bugs were soon found and rectified by this worldwide army of volunteers.<query> what was the first operating system to be developed as a freeware</query> As a result - with a publicly standardized kernel - it was more stable than Windows; keeping Linux servers running for literally hundreds of days without crashing and needing restarting, as Windows regularly did. It turned Bill Gates dream of future 'lock-ins' into a nightmare. It was a platform which really did work effectively across the range of computers - from the smallest handhelds to the largest mainframes - and it was of course free! Linux is now coming of age as Windows did in the early 1990s, and IBM - for one - planned to spend $1 billion on it in 2001. Financial Performance In comparison with the corporate, but caring, IBM machine built by the Watsons, Microsoft is the archetypal product of one man. Depending on your views of modern society, you either love (or at least admire) Gates, as the symbol of American free-markets at their productive (and meanest), best or you hate him, as the symbol of what is worst in a market-based society which knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.<query> what is the linux platform</query> Indeed, as David Bank[lxxi] says, ""High volume, not high prices, is the key to Microsoft's high profits. No other product matches software when it comes to what is called operating leverage. The first copy of a new software program may cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. The second costs pennies."" Ever since it got its 'product' right with the launch of Windows 3.0 in 1990, Microsoft has put in a record setting financial performance: The year by year pattern clearly shows the boost to sales coming from the launch of the new products in mid-1990 and (Windows 1995) in mid 1995.<query> when did microsoft release windows</query> The launch of Windows 98, and the other new products, in mid 1998 did not seem to have the same dramatic effect on sales; but maybe that was not the objective, for these launches gave an even bigger boost to profits! Having survived the Anti-Trust trial largely unscathed, in mid-2002 Bill Gates took a gamble that his monopoly would enable him to bring in even more profits, by changing Microsoft's licensing from a volume-based approach to a subscription-based one which gives him far more control over his customers. Despite the volume of protests, and possible customer moves to competitors, he may get away with this - and rake in even more profit. Thus, David Roberts, chief executive of the blue-chip user group The Infrastructure Forum, says[lxxii] ""Members believe it will take four years to move, and…There's still a huge question about whether the functionality is available with anything else"": remember the phrase 'Nobody got fired for buying IBM', which worked for almost half a century!<query> when did microsoft start</query> Microsoft is now in the position IBM was at its peak, where the migration costs (even if only perceived ones) will keep customers on board until the problems (or the annoyance in the case of Bill Gates) become too high. But Microsoft is now annoying a lot of people, so maybe that day is not too far away! Despite its rapid growth, at the start of the Millennium Microsoft's revenue was only a quarter that of IBM's; though its earnings had passed IBM in 1999 The most significant comparison, though, should be in terms of market capitalisation; where Microsoft's value on Wall Street, at just under $400 billion at the start of the new Millennium was two and a half times as big as that of IBM (even though that had quadrupled since its troubles in the early 1990s)!<query> what is the revenue of microsoft</query>"

Dell's XPS logo indicates highest performance and first-class design by Dell. Regardless, whether you look at 17 inch DTR gaming notebooks or at the compact Dell XPS M1530, you can be sure that XPS notebooks by Dell are always equipped with up-to-date hardware and, so, provide first-class performance. So, it's not surprising that the Dell XPS M1530 is also a very powerful multimedia notebook, which sets a high standard for competitors.<query> what is the dell xps m1530</query> Navigation by means of the touch pad was passable. However, it did sometimes not react immediately. We were especially pleased by the touch pad's fine surfaceand its buttons, because clicking felt soft and was hardly audible. Almost all multimedia notebooks provide hot keys nowadays. And so does the Dell XPS M1530. They are located above the keyboard, have imprinted icons, and are touch-sensitive. Compared to touch-sensitive keys by competitors, you need to apply quite a lot of force in order for the keys to react. Reaction is signaled by a blue LED on each of the hot-keys. The hot-keys have the following functions: Ejecting the disk of the Slot-in DVD drive, Mediaplayer functions, and volume control. Left beside the power switch, there is another hot-key, which can be used to launch theDell Media Direct Center , a software designed to handle multimedia elements, e.g., audio files, pictures, and videos, which can also be run without starting Windows Vista.<query> what is the hot key on a dell laptop</query> Finally, there is also a hardware switch for controlling wireless communication and a hot key for displaying all available wireless networks. Both are located at the right edge near the front. Touch pad Keyboard to top Display While the Dell XPS M1330 is available with a conventional display and LED background-lit screen, theXPS M1530 is at the time of writing only available with a single display version. It is a reflectingWXGA panel, called ""UltraSharp CCFL display with TrueLife"" by the on-line configuration tool. According to a Dell technician, a WXGA+ panel with CCFL technology and a LED display in WXGA format will be available soon. All of the offered panels will have a TrueLife surface. TrueLife refers to a reflecting surface, which unfortunately sometimes even causes annoying reflections indoors. We will discuss this aspect a little later.<query> where is the dell xps m1530</query> The maximum resolution of the WXGA display of 1280x800 pixels is currently standard. Those you would like to work with a number of applications at the same time, might need a bigger desktop and might be better off with a finer resolution. 137.8 cd/m² 168.8 cd/m² 144.9 cd/m² 141.6 cd/m² 172.8 cd/m² 148.5 cd/m² 136.6 cd/m² 148.4 cd/m² 139.7 cd/m² Information Maximum: 172.8 cd/m² Average: 148.8 cd/m² Brightness Distribution: 79 % Black: 0.75 cd/m² Contrast: 230:1 Distribution of brightness The maximum brightness of 172.8 cd/m ² was measured in the center of the display.<query> what is the maximum resolution of a wxga display</query> The brightness diminishes near the borders, especially near the corners, whereas the measuredminimum was 136.6 cd/m ². So, minimum and maximum differ by 20%. The average brightness of the reviewed WXGA panel is 148.8 cd/m², which is rather moderate. A black value of 0.75 cd/m² gives, combined with the good maximum brightness of 172 cd/m ² a calculated maximum contrast ratio of 230:1. Subjectively, the displayed picture looks good, with saturated colors, provided your viewing angle does not deviate to much from the ideal. Dell XPS M1530 outdoor In order to form an opinion about a notebook's mobility, it is important whether a notebook is fit for outdoor usage. Here you have to consider two aspects, the brightness of the display and its surface. First of all the average brightness of 150 cd/m² is just sufficient for working outdoors.<query> what is the brightness of a dell xps laptop</query> Regarding the second aspect, the Dell XPS M1530 is absolutely not fit for outdoor usage, because of its display's reflecting surface. If the environment is bright, you can even face reflections indoors (see video of display's viewing angles). If you try to work outdoors, you can rather use it as mirror than as laptop, because it reflects outdoors even in moderate bright environments. To summarize it, we won't recommend to use the XPS M1530 outdoors, though other magazines do. Another weakness of the display are the relatively narrow viewing angles of its WXGA display, especially vertically. Even when working at a fixed place, we had to readjust the opening angle again and again, because you'll even face an annoying darkening respectively whitening, if you are just a little out off the ideal viewing angles. Horizontally, the picture does not change that dramatically.<query> why is the dell xps m1530 not good outdoors</query> However, at acuter angles, you may reckon that there will be color changes, reflections, and a loss of contrast. Video of Display's Viewing Angles to top Performance Because the Dell XPS M1530 is considered a beginner's gaming notebook, there are of course a number of configuration options available. Regarding processor, Dell offers 4 versions. First of all, there is low-cost version, anIntel Core 2 Duo T5250 CPU with 1.5 GHz, a good configuration for beginners. If you focus on powerful gaming and application performance, you should, however, at least choose aT7250 CPU with 2.0 GHz. The price/performance ratio of the later is ideal. TheT7500 and the T7700 with 2.2 respectively 2.4 GHz are even more powerful, but, also even more costly, e.g., the T7700 costs about 339,- EUR more than the T5250.<query> what is the processor on dell xps m1530</query> Nonetheless, these Core 2 Duo processors guarantee first-class performance in any case. Regarding graphics the user can also choose between two versions. The first one, thenVIDIA Geforce 8400M GS graphics adapter with 128 MB dedicated video memory, is alright for multimedia andoffice applications. For those who like computer games - the actual target group of the Dell XPS M1530 - , the second versions, anVIDIA Geforce 8600M GT with 256 MB GDDR3 memory, will be the graphics adapter of choice. Already the 3DMark 2005/2006benchmark test proves the performance of the reviewed video solution (driver version 7.15.11.5663) and makes reserve capacities obvious. TheGeforce 8600M GT with GDDR3 memory clearly outperforms the identical video card , but, with GDDR2 memory of the Asus V1S. In the 3DMark 2005 and in the 3DMark 2006 benchmarks the performance of the built-in Geforce graphics adapter is already very close to the performance of the Geforce8700M GT video card of the Toshiba Satego X200.<query> what is the best graphics card for dell xps</query> Benchmark Comparison 3D Mark 2005 Benchmark Comparison 3D Mark 2006 The results of the Doom3 and F.E.A.R. benchmark test were also convincing. The Dell XPS M1530 is third, behind the two SLI solutions (8600M GT SLI, 8700M GT SLI). It even clearly outperforms the 8700 M GT video card of the Toshiba Satego. The results of the DirectX9 Ego Shooter FEAR are similar. The Samsung X65 and the Dell XPS M1730 perform marginally better. The XPS M1530 is once again third, whereas the good performance with medium CPU and GPU settings attract special attention. Benchmark Comparison Doom 3 Benchmark Comparison F.E.A.R. Of course the DirectX10 performance of the Dell XPS M1530 is also of great interest. The results of theCrysis benchmark test allows two conclusions: First of all that the 8600M GT is not especially designed for DirectX10.<query> which xps is better</query> Secondly, that video cards with GDDR3 have first-class performance. The Zepto 6224 W with 8600M GT graphic, but, 512 MB DDR2 VRAM is clearly second. The ATI HD 2600 in the Asus G2K is clearly outperformed by the XPS M1530. Performance Crysis Benchmark Comparison Crysis The benchmark results of the strategy game "" World in Conflict "", which also supports DirectX10, are rather disillusioning. Especially at ""high details"" (DirectX10) theachieved frame rates are far from granting gaming joy . World in Conflict Benchmark However, in practice (2v 2, 1280x800, medium details) the performance of Dell XPS was quite alright, whereas we measured 40-50 Fps. The game ran without problems under these settings. But, if there are more players, a lot of animations, like explosions and wads of smoke, the performance will of course decrease and you might face flickering.<query> what is the benchmark for world in conflict</query> Following we tried two current games, Need for Speed pro Streetand another ego shooter: Call of Duty 4- Modern Warefare . During a race with a BMW M3 E92 through the deserts of Nevada at a resolution of 1280x800 and with low details, and anti-aliasing turned off, we measured an average of about 50 Fps. Increasing the details to medium or high, led to a performance loss. Only 30 Fps were possible with these settings, so, it got difficult to play the game. When playing a scene of ""Call of Duty 4"", a fight in the streets of a besieged Russian town, we measured 30-40 Fps on average, whereas the resolution was 1280x800, details standard, and AA off. Overall, the game is therewith playable. Summarizing it, the gaming performance of the Dell XPS M1530 is good, so, it is a good choice when you are looking for a 15 inch gaming notebook.<query> what is the average fps for call of duty</query> Core 2 duo CPU and Geforce 8600M GT with GDDR3 memory in a high-quality and compact 2.6 kg aluminum case: Is there anything left to be desired? We first saw the new XPS design, when we reviewed the 13 inch Dell XPS M1330 , which is a smaller version of the M1530. On the contrary, theDell XPS M1730, a 17 inch DTR gaming notebook comes with a design completely different to its smaller competitors. It basically tries to attract attention by LED illumination. The design of the Dell XPS M1530 is completely different. It isvery thin and extremely elegant. The base unit gets smaller at the front edge and appears even slimmer due to beveled flanks. Overall, this notebook appears to be very compact: The total size of the M1530 is only 358x262 mm, its maximum height 39 mm.<query> what is the size of xps m1530</query> This is especially proved by the direct comparison of the built-in graphics adapter to other solutions. A further positive aspect is, that most of the games (expect of DirectX10 games) can be run at the native resolution of its display (i.e., 1280x800), so, the quality of the images are not affected by interpolations. According to the PCMark 05 result, the application performance of this notebook is average. Comparing its Cinebench results to other notebooks, it is also average, which is the same level of, e.g., theLenovo T61. Furthermore, this indicates that the performance of the reviewed XPS M1530 (T7250 CPU, 8600M GT graphic, 2 GB of RAM, 160 GB/5400 HDD) ismore than sufficient for office and multimedia applications. PCMark 2005 Benchmark Cinebench R10 The reviewed XPS M1530 was equipped with a hard disk with a revolution speed of 5400 revs/ min by Seagate.<query> what is the performance of xps m1530</query> Its transfer rates are good compared to competitors of the same class. The lowaccess time of only 16.5 ms, is nearly comparable to that of 7200 revs/min hard disks. The on-line configuration tool makes it possible to choose out of a number of alternatives. Thereby hard disks up to a capacity of 250GB with either 5400 or 7200 revs/ min are available. The 64 GB Solid State Disk , whose transfer rates are outstanding and whose access time is nearly incredible, (see also32 GB SSD reviewed in an Alienware Area-51 M9750 Notebook) is a very interesting model. Further pros of the SSD solution are low power consumption, low noise emissions, and data security, because it is absolutely insensitive to shocks. However, SSD solutions are still rather expensive.

In the idle mode (energy profile balanced) the notebook computer the noise level is most of the time not more than 34.8 dB, measured in a distance of 10cm, which is about the position of the head). The fan stays deactivated most of the time and you can merely hear thenoise of the hard disk. Sometimes, the fan ran for a short time. So, if you'd like a nearly absolutely silent notebook, you should go for the Solid State hard disk (SSD), if you can afford it. Under load the fan starts running, whereas the noise level is 39.5 dB at its lowest revolution speed. When playing games, we measured a maximumnoise level of 42.2 dB. Subjectively, the maximum noise level is clearly audible, but, also tolerable.<query> what is the noise level of a notebook</query> The noise is such high, when playing computer games. However, the concentration on the game and the sound of the game will surely attract more attention, so, the noise of the fan gets not too obvious. More than this, the noise of the DVD drive is annoying, which loudly clicks, when reading a CD/DVD. The clearly too high noise level of49.9 dB measured during DVD back is about as high as during data transfer from the DVD. When playing DVD via Media Direct Center (without starting Windows), the noise level was only 39.9 dB, which is an average noise level of DVD drives of this notebook class.

Basically, because of the aluminum parts, the temperature is rather evenly distributed on the top side. The temperature at the bottom side is similar to the top side. Here we measured a goodmaximum of 36.6° Celsius. The temperature is again evenly distributed and also hot spots are due to aluminum chassis avoided.

The sound output of the 3.5 mm stereo jacks was with alright. to top Battery Runtime BatteryEater Classic BatteryEater Readers The reviewed Dell XPS M1530 was equipped with a 6 cells lithium ions battery with a capacity of 56 Wh. A 9 cell battery with a 85 Wh capacity is available for 30 EUR extra charge. For increased mobility, this options is definitely worth consideration. Because of the opening mechanism of the display, which folds open across the battery to the back, thebigger battery's height had to be increased, so, that it is possible to put 9 instead of only 6 cells into it.<query> what is the capacity of a dell xps m1530 battery</query> This move the back edge of the notebook upwards, so, that it is in slanting position afterwards. The measured battery runtime of the 56 Wh battery ranges form about80 minutes under load to a maximum of 223 minutes in energy-saving mode (minimal brightness, wireless functions off). The runtime during DVD playback was only 85 minutes (profile: balanced, maximum brightness). When watching DVDs in energy-saving mode, the picture flickers. The rating of the runtime is clearly better in practice during WLan operation. In energy saving mode, it is possible to work about 3 hours unplugged. Although we would still recommend the 9 cell battery for intensive mobile work, this runtime allows reasonable mobile work with the 6 cells battery possible too.

We were also pleased by its low noise emissions in idle mode. Still providing sufficient reserve capacities, the noise is pleasantly low when browsing the Internet or processing texts. When playing games, the noise emissions aren't that obvious anyway, as you focus on the game. The surface temperature is also always alright, so, proving the XPS M1530's good temperature control.

The haptics of the surface feels also good. The palm rest areas are embellished by big aluminum part. Its brush-finished surface feels good. Metal parts were also used to improve the haptics of the display. To summarize it, we got a notion that the Dell XPS M1530 is of high-quality. Deficiencies of the display region Weaknesses in Workmanship Next to the Display While there are neither weaknesses regarding stability of the base unit nor of the display, scrutinizing the case, we found some smaller deficiencies regarding workmanship, e.g.,uneven gaps, especially, where parts of different material get in contact, and next to thehinges and the battery.<query> what is the xps m1530 made of</query> Furthermore, the plastic part next to the right hinge wobbles a little bit.

The reviewed notebook was also equipped with afingerprint reader, which makes it possible to scan the fingerprint instead of typing a password. The Dell XPS M1530 also comes with a lot of accessories. E.g., there is a wrapper, which make it possible to easily transport the notebook. However, it's can only take the notebook itself. There isn't even enough space left for the power adapter. Besides some tools and driver software, also an operating system (Windows Home Premium on a DVD) is included.<query> what is the dell xps m1530</query> But this still is not all. In order to provide a special incentive for XPS buyers, an elegant briefcase for the provided CDs and the comprehensive user manual is included. Aremote control of ExpressCard size,headphones by Creative , and also a micro fibre cloth for cleaning the notebook are also amongst the accessories. Lots of Accessories are Provided Interfaces Because display's release mechanism, most of the interfaces can be found at the left and the right side of the case. But, you'll find everything required for a useful multimedia notebook. There are a total of 3 USB 2.0 ports, two of them at the right side, one at the left side near the back. Furthermore, a S-video and a VGA port, a Firewire port, and aHDMI port, which makes connecting an external high-resolution display and transmitting digital video and audio signals possible.<query> what is included in xps laptop</query> Due to the chosen design, there wasn't too much space available at the flanks. Still, the designers tried to locate the ports near the back. The hard disk is at the left side near the front, whilst the right side provides an ExpressCard slot and a Slot-In DVD drive. So, annoying cable spaghetti can be more or less avoided. prevented by it in the main. Only theaudio ports (two for headphones, and a Mic-In) are at the center of the front edge. Instead of the 8xDVD+/-RW drive the reviewed notebook came with, the Dell XPS M1530 can also be equipped with aBlu-Ray drive. It makes storing up to 50 GB (dual layer) on a proper data carrier possible. However, this version of the XPS M1530 currently costs 350.- EUR more.<query> where is the hard drive on a dell xps laptop</query> Alike other XPS notebooks, also the XPS M1530 provides an optional UMTS module.

The keyboard is not especially structured, but, the size of the keys is alright. The enter key is especially big. The height of the keys in the last row, i.e., ESC, some F keys, Ins, and Del is a little bit smaller than usually.<query> where is the xps m1530</query> However, this did not cause any problems when using the keyboard. Typing felt good. The key feedback is clear, the end of the key travel is soft. If you apply force to the keyboard, it slightly yields. However, so little that it is acceptable. It just makes typing feel even more cushioned. The keyboard is absolutely user-friendly and proper for intesive typing. Its noise is even when typing faster low, you can just hear a quiet clicking. We liked the simple form of the touch pad , which harmonizes well with the look of the Dell XPS M1530. The edge to the surrounding aluminum cover is just perceptible. So, it's comfortable for the sliding fingers, and there is still adequate feedback about the position on the pad. Horizontal and vertical scroll regions are visually highlighted.<query> what is the keyboard noise</query>"

IT Software Strategy S/W Dev Tools & Tips Tech Trends Expert Insight Feature RSS Multicore Platforms Virtualization Cloud Computing Security Parallel Programming Open Source/Linux Mobile Software Tech Trends Where Do Ultrabook Devices Fit In? By: Tim Kridel email facebook addthis ""Sexy"" might not be the first adjective that comes to mind when thinking about enterprise-grade notebooks, but that's howsome reviews are describing the first generation ofUltrabook devices. The initial models -- from vendors such as Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, LG and Toshiba -- shipped in late 2011, and in 2012 Intel believes there will be 75 Ultrabook devices announced or available. The Ultrabook design is less about a checklist of must-meet specs -- which Intel says are under NDA with vendors -- and more about delivering certain types of user experiences.<query> where do ultrabooks fit in</query> It identifies installed apps that use permissions that could be dangerous, and provides remote locating and locking. Ultra-sharp, Inexpensive Display Previous Next Cross-platform or Pedal to the Metal? Are You Stuck on XP With IE6? Hard Time for Hard Drives Developer Mobile Software Software Dev Tools user interfaces Multicore Platforms Virtualization Open Source/Linux cloud Security Parallel Programming IT Software Strategy S/W Dev Tools & Tips Tech Trends Expert Insight Terms of Use - Privacy - Contact Us - About Us - Disclaimer - Leave Feedback Copyright © 2012 Studio One Networks. All Rights Reserved<query> what is the software tool for xp</query> For example, all Ultrabook devices must be able to wake up in less than seven seconds so users always have immediate access to both content stored on their Ultrabook and Web-based data. Those abilities come, respectively, viaIntel’s Rapid Start and Smart Connect technologies . [Disclosure: Intel is the sponsor of this content.] “It’s extremely convenient,” says ​Brian Pitstick, executive director of laptop marketing for consumers and SMBs at Dell, whose initial Ultrabook is the XPS 13. “Smart Connect allows the device to periodically wake up while it’s asleep and refresh the content. So as you open it up, within seconds, you have updated content.” Those abilities could help make Ultrabook devices attractive to enterprises that are using or considering tablets, whose always-on design helps boost productivity. “One thing we’ve heard from the users who have done that is that one of the major purchase drivers is lightweight, easy to take with me, highly convenient in terms of instant on,” Pitstick says.<query> what is the intel smart connect</query> “We believe we’re delivering on that with this device. At the same time, customers say they want to stay productive, and in a lot of cases, productivity requires a keyboard, [Microsoft] Office compatibility and the right performance. That’s what makes it a different proposition than a tablet.” Bring Your Own Ultrabook If Ultrabook devices are known for anything so far, it’s their thin, light designs. The Toshiba Portégé Z830, for example, weighs less than 2.5 pounds and is 0.63 inch thick. If that svelte figure makes Ultrabook devices popular with consumers, that’s another way they could wind up in the enterprise. “The Ultrabook is a poster child BYOB (bring your own box) PC,” says Rob Enderle, principal analyst atEnderle Group. Some vendors are designing their Ultrabook devices to support that kind of scenario.<query> what is the ultrabook</query> “We do things like add a TPM chip so it has data-encryption security capabilities,” Pitstick says. “We have custom-configuration services [so] IT administrators can get custom images, BIOS settings, asset tags, things like that. Bringing any kind of device into an enterprise environment can cause a lot of headaches for IT. So with this class of device, we’ve thought about capabilities that would ease those concerns.” When it’s the enterprise buying the Ultrabook, it’s important to scrutinize the specs and try it out first. That’s standard advice for any notebook, but it’s particularly valuable for Ultrabook devices because their svelte designs force vendors to get creative in areas such as durability and battery life. “Think through what the minimums are in terms of a feature set you’ll allow into the enterprise and make sure that spec is communicated well,” Enderle says.<query> why is it important to test an ultrabook</query> “Some Ultrabook [devices] have brighter displays and may work better outdoors, suggesting that when that is a requirement, even the screen performance (measured in nits) should be given as a selection criteria. “This really is a class of product that varies a great deal vendor to vendor. The buyer should try a variety of offerings before making their decision to determine which feature set, feel and appearance works best for them.” New Market Opportunities? If their thin, light designs encourage consumers and business users to carry an Ultrabook in more places, they could create new opportunities to make or save money. For example, a growing number of vendors offer cloud-based video conferencing services that support a wide variety of endpoint types, from high-end telepresence rooms down to PCs, smart phones and tablets.<query> why ultrabooks are thin</query> For some users, participating in a video conference with a 10-inch tablet or a 3.5-inch smart phone might feel cramped -- to the point that they avoid using those services, undermining productivity. With screen sizes between 11 inches and 14 inches, Ultrabook devices could be big enough to provide a good video conferencing user experience in hotel rooms, home offices and airport lounges. And as full-fledged PCs, Ultrabook devices also would enable collaboration such as file sharing, something that’s difficult on a tablet or smart phone. “You want to be able to share and create while you’re talking,” Pitstick says. “Having the processing capability, the PC compatibility and keyboard becomes pretty important.” The same benefits also could enable enterprises to offer a wider range of services aimed at mobile consumers, particularly those who don’t want to carry a heavy notebook or struggle to make do with a tablet or smartphone.<query> what is the screen size of an ultrabook</query> “What we often hear on the customer side is most people who buy laptops leave them in the home,” Pitstick says. “When it’s easier to take outside the house, I think you’ll start to see more people take it outside the house. Maybe they’re a whole new segment of devices purchased as a result.” Read more about: IT Software Strategy email facebook addthis Tim Kridel has been covering all things tech and telecom since 1998 for a variety of publications and analyst firms.

(A Roper poll shows that that 70 percent agree that colleges and universities should require courses in basic skills. The figure jumps to 80 percent among those in the 25 to 34 year old bracket.) Instead, catalogs are stuffed with pseudo-intellectual, ideological, and even silly courses and majors that require little mental effort and are often brimming over with ideological bias. Students are often able to select from a wide range of courses and, predictably, many choose the easy way out. (Mass communications, sports psychology, and gender and sexual studies anyone?) Students need not major in, say, history or English if such studies lack employer appeal, but history and English should be somewhere on a graduate's transcript.<query> what courses should i take at university</query> Exposure to the literature itself is important, even if the professor isn't. Perspective, serious thought, and good writing skills can be useful, on and off the job. Today nearly 40 percent of American adults have a bachelor's degree and higher, and yet the state of our popular culture and our political-intellectual life is scandalously low. In part this is because a college diploma too often signifies very little beyond foresight and persistence. If you think I'm exaggerating, read Mark Bauerlein's The Dumbest Generation. The author documents in detail the miserable state of ignorance and anti-intellectualism shared by both our high school and college graduates. You can also learn the significance of computers and tech toys in the overall decline. And don't miss the new bookAcademically Adrift: Learning on College Campuses by Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa.<query> what percentage of americans have a bachelor's degree</query> The authors document lax standards in the classroom, and report that 36 percent of students experienced no significant improvement in learning after four years of higher education. According to theAssociation of American Colleges and Universities, 63 percent of employers believe that recent college graduates lack the skills necessary for success. I believe that educators are more to blame than students. Weak academic requirements are often products of deliberate efforts to keep campuses growing and prosperous. Students deserve more knowledge for their (often borrowed) money, even if they don't want it. Our culture cries out for the learning that might produce higher standards of conduct, thought, sensitivity, and responsibility. We must also, of course, be able to compete effectively in the world marketplace. Few Americans want to be speaking Chinese in the near or distant future. Thomas C. Reeves writes from Wisconsin.<query> what percent of college graduates lack the skills necessary for success</query> Among his dozen books are Twentieth Century America: A Brief History, and biographies of John F.

Some leading institutions get Ds. American colleges and universities, widely admired throughout the world, have come under heavy fire in recent years. Critics complain that costs are too high, that too many professors shirk their classroom duties, that leftist indoctrination and political correctness are rampant, that breadth of knowledge requirements are minimal, that graduation rates are low, and that employment prospects for graduates are far below what students expected. Some grads are carrying signs in Occupy rallies demanding that the government wipe out or reduce their college debts. Higher education is indeed expensive. This fall tuition and fees went up by 8.3 percent at four-year public colleges and universities. Financially strapped California led the way with a whopping 21 percent hike. The average cost of a single year at a private college--tuition, fees, and room and board--is US$38,589.<query> how much does it cost to go to college</query> Tuition and fees alone for an in-state resident at a public college and university amount to over $9,000. During the last decade, campus costs have risen an average of 6 percent a year, well above increases in paychecks and general inflation. Total outstanding college loans are soon expected to top $1 trillion, a sum larger than all credit card debt. And the borrowing continues. In 2009, the average college student debt was $24,000. It is true as well that many (certainly not most) professors are scholars as well as teachers and therefore attempt to avoid heavy classroom schedules in favor of research and writing. By 2005, lower cost and untenured faculty amounted to 68.1 percent of all professors. Some 48 percent of college teachers were part-time employees. It's obvious that students are often being denied exposure to expertise in a wide variety of fields.<query> average college student debt</query> It is ironic that despite annual cost hikes and the use of cheap labor, a great many campus endowments have reached astounding levels. By early 2011, Harvard could boast of an endowment of more than $27 billion. (As in government, many leading educators think in billions, not millions.) Yale's was at $16 billion, and Princeton and the University of Texas System could boast of having more than $14 billion. In 2010, 30 campuses had endowments of more than $1.8 billion. The rising, if shaky, stock market has been helpful in increasing campus endowments throughout the country. The issue of liberal indoctrination and the iron grip of political correctness on campus has often been studied. The National Association of Scholars, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, and activist David Horowitz, among others, have provided us with an abundance of evidence, especially in the humanities and social sciences, that we need not explore here.<query> how many universities have endowments</query> The fact is that students are too often unexposed to both sides of issues and lack opportunities to think for themselves. Conservatives on campus, students and faculty, suffer. Then there is matter of what college graduates are supposed to know. A study sponsored by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, WhatWillTheyLearn.com grades 1,000 colleges and universities on the breadth of their graduation requirements and lists graduation rates. Campuses are graded from A to F on the basis of seven key areas of knowledge: composition, literature, foreign language, US history, economics, mathematics, and science. (Curiously, philosophy, fine arts, and the history of Western civilization are ignored.) Most educators and many students are well aware of theU.S. News ranking of campuses, in part a reflection of the reputation of professors on board. Now we have a more objective study pointing to the knowledge being required of students.<query> what is the a to f grade for colleges</query> There are many, often shocking, surprises. In Massachusetts, for example, not a single campus earned an ""A."" (That is true of most states.) Tufts and Wellesley earned a ""B,"" MIT received a ""C,"" Brandeis, Harvard, and Williams received a ""D,"" and Amherst, Mt. Holyoke, Smith, and Holy Cross were graded ""F."" Academic reputations can be deceiving. In California, Pepperdine, California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, and the California State University at Dominguez Hills (which has a large minority enrollment), received an ""A."" Almost all the California State University campuses and the University of California-San Diego earned a ""B."" Stanford, Pomona, the University of Southern California, and the University of California -Santa Barbara received a ""C."" Mills and the University of California-Santa Cruz, received a ""D."" The flunk-outs included Occidental and the University of California campuses at Berkeley, Davis, and Irvine.<query> what colleges get a b</query> In Wisconsin, the ""B"" range includes Marian and the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Campuses rated ""C"" include Marquette and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Graded ""D"" were Beloit, Carthage, Lawrence, and the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Trailing with ""F"" were Alverno, and the University of Wisconsin campuses at Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Parkside. (Both Milwaukee and Parkside, neighbors of mine, were given bottom ratings in theU.S. News rankings as well.) Other schools around the nation receiving ""A"" include the Air Force, Army, and Coast Guard Academies, Brooklyn College, St. Johns Maryland, and Gardner-Webb. Among the ""B"" institutions are the University of Chicago, Ave Maria, Columbia, Cornell, St. Bonaventure, Seattle University, the US Naval Academy, Loyola University in Chicago, the University of Miami, Notre Dame, Duke, and Villanova.<query> what colleges are rated a b</query> At the other end of the scale nationally, the ""D""s include Johns Hopkins, Yale, Northwestern, the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, Ohio University, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the University of Oregon, Reed, Bryn Mawr, Penn State, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. At the very bottom we find: Vassar (where tuition alone is $43,190), the University of Rochester, Lake Forest, Knox, New College of Florida, Case Western Reserve, the University of Cincinnati, Colorado College, Bucknell, Dickinson, Gettysburg, Trinity, and Wesleyan. There appears to be no correlation between breadth of knowledge requirements and graduation rates. In Massachusetts, ""F"" rated Amherst graduates 95 percent of its students, while ""D"" rated Harvard graduates 97 percent.<query> what colleges have d</query> In Wisconsin, ""C"" rated Madison leads the state with 83 percent graduation, and ""F"" rated Parkside trails all with a rate of 32 percent. High admission standards and venerable campus academic reputations appear to correlate most closely with high graduation rates. Students want a prestige degree, and actual knowledge acquired in the college classroom seems to be of secondary importance. That should not be surprising since American students, for many generations, have gone to college with rising socio-economic success as the foremost consideration. Business is the most popular major. As for the conflicting claims that there aren't enough college graduates, and on the other hand that there are fewer and fewer jobs for college graduates, perhaps we need to reconsider what a college and university diploma should mean. What is an educated person? I believe that the American Council of Trustees and Alumni has it right when they argue for breadth of knowledge.<query> what is the most popular major for college graduates</query>"

If he’s the biggest (Major League ready) piece you give up (save Werth, of course) for the chance for Halladay/Hamels/Haren for the next three years, I’d take that risk. As for Cosart and Colvin…we wouldn’t be giving up both, just one. It’s awesome they look so good right now, but they’ve still got a ways to progress before they get to the majors. This isn’t Drabek, who this time last year looked like he’d be ready for a 2010 callup…it’ll be a little while before they’re ready. The Phils have low-level arms. To get Haren, one would be expendable.<query> who is the biggest starter you give up</query> by Aphilfan on Jul 24, 2010 3:28 PM EDT up reply actions A cost-controlled 4/5 starter, who, though clearly lucky, managed to get by hitters pretty damn well. If he even approaches another season like that, at his cost, which is basically nothing, he’s worth a good bit. And I just dislike giving up one of the two A-level aces, as just imagining a 2014 squad headed by both of them would be something, eh? But Haren strengthens us enough for the next few years, I guess it really is a good value. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 3:49 PM EDT up reply actions Agredd….a 4/5 starter and unknowns for a proven top flight starter is a no doubter to me.

Finally, Oswalt has been just under a 5 win player over the past 9.5 seasons, though most of that happened more than a couple years ago. I just don’t see how Haren is NOT the better choice, if we have one? by EJL on Jul 24, 2010 12:08 PM EDT up reply actions Oh he clearly is.<query> how many wins has haren won</query> It’s just everyone wonders what the Dbacks want for him. He’s available, but is it a good amount, or a crazy amount? by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 12:23 PM EDT up reply actions RAJ Decision Process Over at Broad Street Nation, we have been gnashing our teeth at Paul Holmgren’s (lack of) decision process. With RAJ, we’ve noticed he tends to take a “decide-now” way of doing business. Do analysis, then immediately act on the decision. Sometimes this works well….like saying PTB, thanks for the memories, see ya. Other times, like in the Lee trade, not so well. Here, I am concerned RAJ has “locked in” to Oswalt..or whoever. It is really important in this context, especially if ownership has decided on a strict budget (no, even from a profitability point of view, this is probably a bad idea, but that’s off-topic right now) that there is “out of the box” thinking.<query> what is raj decision process</query> This isn’t easy for someone with a Stanford engineering degree. Note I am not knocking Stanford per se, but someone from Stanford, and especially someone with an engineering degree, tends to the logical pure analysis way of doing business. Of course, that rationality plus the occasional Stanford ethos/elitism yields our RAJ smug-meter. Here, I think besides Haren (totally agree on all the posts about Haren being a better option worth the extra trade amount) RAJ ought to be thinking about other options. Like Brett Myers (yes, eat crow RAJ). Like Randy Wolf, whose kERA is really high right now, but whom he might be able to get with the Brewers picking up most of the tab. Like some of the players on the Blue Jays. Like Paul Maholm, currently out of favor, but who is still a relatively inexpensive option.<query> who is haren raj</query> If we can’t get Haren, given that we already have Halladay and a resurgent Hamels, we actually don’t need a front-liner. And I especially dislike giving up Happ for Oswalt right now (selling low on the ROY runner-up; Happ for Haren is fine). The ideal candidate is the 2007 Kyle Lohse. Yes I am old. I remember the Phils good old days and their bad old days. Course, the good old days I'm thinking of were in 2009.

Oliver’s an interesting case in that he’s a lefty with really good raw stuff, but it’s never fully translated into results.

The Phillies are still trying to unload Jayson Werth to help facilitate a trade for Oswalt while the Dodgers and Astros have exchanged some names.<query> who is roy oswalt traded to</query> The Twins, however, are not in on the 32-year-old right-hander. That doesn’t read to me that Oswalt no longer is demanding his 2012 option be picked up by anyone, but that he would be willing to restructure things in a trade that sent him to the Cardinals. Not necessarily the case if he the Phillies wanted to trade for him. Looking forward to the Kevin Kolb era. 5-8-10...the day the Purdue Boilermakers basketball team won the 2011 NCAA Championship!! by EREX21 on Jul 24, 2010 10:21 AM EDT reply actions Haren, Haren, Haren, Haren, Haren Oswalt… why? He’s more expensive, has a shorter contract, isn’t quite as good… and it’s not like the D’backs asking price looks like all that much at this point.<query> how old is haren oswalt</query> I was dumbfounded this morning when I sawwhat the Yankees had put on the table for Haren — the fact that a club would even seriously offer something like that just confirms my suspicion that Haren is very seriously underrated as a commodity. Ruben: do it. Don’t let the Arizona front office peeps off the phone until you find out what they want you to deal Werth for, add Happ to the package plus any incidental pieces necessary, and get it done. If you’re really entertaining the idea of dealing for Oswalt, then this should be an absolute no-brainer. Seriously, if I see Haren move somewhere else for a package anything remotely like the one above, while you putz around figuring out if you can trade our top prospects for Roy Oswalt, I’m going to skip the bar exam, drive down to CBP, and commit some serious assault and battery on your ass.<query> who is roy oswalt traded for</query> by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 11:48 AM EDT reply actions I’m guessing Haren would require, at the very least, Happ, some good prospects in return for Werth (which really is the main unknown), and maybe even one of our Single A star prospects. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 11:51 AM EDT up reply actions and that would be just fine http://www.thegoodphight.com by WholeCamels on Jul 24, 2010 11:58 AM EDT up reply actions But the problem there is who knows what we’re getting for Werth? Will it be enough to make that? And of course, how will Ruben manage to overpay? by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 12:22 PM EDT up reply actions What we can get for Werth is an open question, but I’m optimistic on that front.<query> what kind of prospects does haren need</query> First off, with DeJesus now out for the year (not to mention Hart jamming his thumb last night, though he’s not expected to miss much time), you’d have to think that the demand for Werth would be fairly substantial. Secondly, I mean… justlook at that offer the Yankees made. I don’t even really need to know who the other two prospects are (it wouldn’t be Montero or Sanchez)… the fact that the D’backs have any interest in Ivan Nova and Zach MacAllister as their “young pitching” return just shows that they’re completely missing the boat here. Between Werth, Happ, one of Colvin/Cosart, and a few smaller pieces (think Mathieson, Worley, etc.) there’s definitely enough to get this done. And to answer your below question, I don’t think that’s a crazy amount at all.<query> who is werth</query> by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 12:28 PM EDT up reply actions haven’t the phils been fleeced by the yanks in recent trades? At least the abreu/lidle one. by Bilzo on Jul 24, 2010 12:58 PM EDT up reply actions Better not be Happ+Colvin/Cosart, thank you. That’s a bit too much to swallow, even though 3 1/2 years of Haren would be amazing. by philsandthrills on Jul 24, 2010 2:45 PM EDT up reply actions To each his own, but in my mind, Happ + Werth + Colvin/Cosart is a bargain for a top 15 pitcher in baseball on a relatively team-friendly deal. by PhillyFriar on Jul 24, 2010 3:09 PM EDT up reply actions A bargain? I guess you really value Cosart or Colvin less than I do, and probably Happ somewhat as well.<query> who is happ and cosart</query>"
clueweb12-1702wb-33-10935,50,1,"A Historical Overview of American Soccer History 4 SPECIALTY GIFTS Soccer Player History An Overview of American Soccer History By Dave Litterer The American Soccer History Archives This page is a detailed historical overview of United States soccer from its roots in the 19th century to the present day. Origins, 1609-1862 Various forms of soccer-style games have been around since Roman times, and the United States was the first British colony to start playing soccer-style games. Some form of football was played in the Colonies as far back as the establishment of the original Jamestown settlement in 1609. The rules are unclear, but they most likely resembled the sprawling Shrovetide games then popular in England. It was soon banned by ordinance as a reputed bad influence, and for the next two centuries appeared only in the least restricted of colonial communities.<query> when did soccer start</query> This was a trend in Europe as well as the US. As immigration increased, the new arrivals brought soccer traditions with them, and the game grew rapidly in the northeastern industrial cities. The growth first took place in the West Hudson region of New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City, soon spreading by the late 1870's to Fall River, and New Bedford, MA. Pick-up games and loose informal teams soon grew into established clubs and led to corporate sponsorship finally the development of local and even regional leagues. The game spread to other parts of New England including Boston and Rhode Island, and into Baltimore, and in the 1880's, into Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis, and finally Pittsburgh. The game was continually hampered by sociological forces-- Baseball was seen as the American past-time, and many immigrants would attempt to Americanize themselves to assimilate, often switching to baseball from soccer which was seen increasingly as a sport only played by foreigners.<query> where did soccer originate</query> The league also signed a five year TV contract in 2001. Finally, a first class soccer-specific stadium opened in Los Angeles in 2003, with other stadiums confirmed or in proposal stages at Dallas, Chicago and New York. The Indoor game saw some consolidation as the NPSL morphed into the new single-entity Major Indoor Soccer League II, eventually absorbing the World Indoor Soccer League, and beginning a renaissance in 2004. A new phenomenon was launched in 2003, with a highly successful tour by Manchester United and several other top European clubs. Although not sponsored by MLS, the tour saw sellout crowds at some of the largest US Stadiums, leading MLS to set up tours of their own in 2004. The USL saw continued consolidation with increasing strength in their 2nd Division A-League, and great expansion in their Super Y-League.<query> when did the mls start</query> Increasingly, MLS clubs established reserve squads who played in USL’s amateur division. Overall, as 2004 progressed, there were a number of positive directions being taken at all levels of US soccer, particularly steps to ensure the long-term viability of the game.

All rights reserved.<query> when did soccer start</query> In 1884, a group of ex-British enthusiasts met in Newark and formed the American Football Association, the fourth national association to be formed. Besides attempting to coordinate the proliferating local and regional amateur leagues, the AFA established the first National Championship competition, the American Cup, which was first won by ONT (""Our New Thread"", brand name for the sponsoring sewing manufacturer in Kearny, NJ) in 1885. Before the cup's suspension in 1898, the bulk of the champions were primarily from Southeastern New England, which had turned into the first true soccer hotbed in the country, with its ""golden triangle"" of Fall River, Pawtucket and New Bedford. The AFA also organized the first national team, which played two games against Canada (a 0-1 loss on 11/28/1885, and a 3-2 win in 1886).<query> when was the american football association formed</query> Soccer grew at a moderate pace during the early 1890's, spreading to Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland and even San Francisco and Los Angeles by the end of the century. Corporate sponsorship had led to some leagues attaining semi-pro stats, and more and more teams were based on cultural and ethnic organizations rather than factories and corporations. The AFA favored the semi-pro clubs in its American Cup scheduling, and the New York clubs withdrew in protest to form the American Amateur Football Association in 1893. The game was slowly being reintroduced on a low-level basis in colleges. Finally, in 1894, the first attempt was made to establish a fully professional soccer league. Interestingly, this league was not promoted by any of the existing soccer associations, but was formed by a group of professional baseball owners from the National league, and was intended to fill the baseball stadiums during down time.<query> when did soccer start</query> The league even used The American League of Professional Football had six teams from major Northeastern cities, and made its 1894 debut with much fanfare, but attendance was low after the first week, partially to the scheduling of too many weekday games, and some managers used less than ethical measures to procure overseas players. The league collapsed among heavy financial losses during its first season. The Doldrums, 1895-1913 It was not long before the powers that be attempted to follow on the ALPF's footsteps at a more financially responsible level. The National Association Football League was formed in 1895 from premier teams of the New York City and New Jersey regional leagues, and struggled through four seasons. By this time, there was a waning enthusiasm exacerbated by the infighting among the various associations. Fan interest and participation were falling, and the NAFBL and the American Cup were both suspended in 1898.<query> when was the nafbl formed</query> Other sports were becoming popular such as Polo and Boxing, and suddenly soccer did not look so important anymore. This would not last for long fortunately. In 1904, US teams participated in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, winning the gold. This must have sparked some enthusiasm, as the St. Louis Soccer League went professional in 1906, the same year as the NAFBL and the American Cup was revived. By this time, New England was beginning to wane as the premier hotbed of the country and most American Cup winners would come from New Jersey/New York or Philadelphia. The revived National Association Football League, formed by a group of people from regional state and local leagues, consisted of teams, which had previously played in municipal leagues. Originally operating out of the New York-New Jersey area, it eventually added Bethlehem Steel, a powerhouse from eastern Pennsylvania, and the league operated until 1921.<query> when did soccer start</query> This was the first truly successful pro league in the US. The formation of FIFA in 1904 left the USA on the outside looking in due to the lack of a truly national organizing association. However, the addition of Soccer as an official medal sport for the 1908 Olympics led to increasing interest in international competition (following the hugely successful 1906 tour by Pilgrim FC from England in 1906). FIFA would not recognize either the AFA or the AAFA as a legitimate national body, locked as they were in a bitter war. By this time, the AFA was allied with the English FA, but their actions angered many, and a number of key regional associations switched allegiance to the AAFA. Finally, after FIFA had rejected an American application for membership at their 1912 congress, the rapidly growing AAFA members met on April 5, 1913 and formed the United States Football Association, which was accepted by FIFA.<query> when was soccer created</query> The AFA threw in its towel at this point, but the American Cup until 1929. One objective of this new association was to end the struggle between amateur and professional soccer organizations for hegemony, a struggle that would last well into the 1960's until the Association became more professionalized under the direction of Werner Fricker. The First Dynasties, 1913-1921 The ethnic influence affected the course of the game through the early 1900's -- it was still clustered mainly in working-class communities along the northeastern part of the United States, as well as some selected cities such as St. Louis, Chicago and Pittsburgh. Leagues were mostly amateur and semi-pro, usually very localized and based on state associations. Eventually its growing success resulted in attempts to establish national leagues. At this time, due to the United States large size and the difficulty of transportation, there were no true national leagues, even major league baseball was entirely situated in the northeast and Midwest, although minor leagues operated all over the country.<query> when did professional soccer start</query> The same occurred with Soccer, with true major leagues earning that title mainly through their higher level of professionalism, rather than the amount of territory covered. Soccer went into a mini-decline around the turn of the century, which was reversed by the re-establishment of the NASFL and American Cup in 1906, and the decision of the St. Louis Soccer League to turn fully professional. The tide started to shift from New England to the New York/New Jersey region, as the NAFBL gained strength and the cup was won primarily by New York-based teams. The Southern New England Football league formed in 1914, out of some of the stronger of the local semi-pro teams in New England. By this time, soccer was also established in Eastern Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Chicago, and Pittsburgh, and had made its re-entry at several dozen colleges.<query> when was soccer established</query> Probably the most important developments to follow the establishment of the USFA (Now the USSF) were the establishment of an official national championship tournament (the National Challenge Cup), which was first played in 1914, and the debut of sanctioned international competition. The Challenge Cup, open to any club that wished to enter, amateur or pro, was the first truly national competition, and did much to increase the prestige of the game. Now known as the US Open Cup, this is the oldest continuous team sport tournament in the country (outside of the World Series and Hockey's Stanley Cup), but in later years, the cup struggled to be taken seriously by the ISL and NASL in the 1960's. By this time, the first true dynasties were beginning to emerge, among the Fall River Rovers, Bethlehem Steel, Kearny Scots and others.<query> when was the us open cup established</query> Their first games, in 1916, included a 3-2 win over the new Swedish team, and a 1-1 draw with Norway. Sadly, World War I derailed the international tours, and the US did not field a national team again until the 1924 Olympics. Three of the early dynasties of American Soccer were the Fall River Rovers, winners of the American Cup in 1888 and 1889, and Bethlehem Steel, who won the American Cup in 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1919 (finalist in 1920), and winners of the National Challenge Cup in 1915, 1916, 1918, and 1919 (finalist in 1917). Bethlehem won the first ""doubles"", copping both cups in 1916, 1918 and 1919. In fact, Bethlehem won a ""triple"" in 1919, by virtue of also winning the NASFL title that year (followed by league titles the next two seasons).<query> when did the first american soccer team start</query> The Golden Era, 1921-1933 The 1920's were widely considered the first Golden Era in American Soccer. With the founding of the American Soccer League in 1921, there was finally a league with enough prestige to compete effectively for European players, and even perform on a par with the early National Football League. During the 1920-1921 season, the Southern New England Football League and the National Association Football League were suffering financial difficulties. Although both leagues had powerhouse teams such as Bethlehem Steel, New York F.C., J&P Coates and Fall River, both leagues were split among haves and have-nots, and the richer teams felt they were subsidizing the poorer ones to their detriment. They solved this dilemma by pulling the plugs on both leagues, with the richer clubs joining together to form the nucleus of a new league, the ASL.<query> when was the golden era of soccer</query> This group attempted to establish a series of rules, which would please everyone, but they couldn't resolve issues such as use of hands, allowing hacking of opponents, etc. Many supporters of these elements (considered more ""manly"") eventually withdrew and formed the Rugby Football Union, and the FA established rules more similar to the modern game. The next major development was the establishment of a knockout cup in 1871, based on the house competitions at Harrow School. These knockouts, in which most teams names are placed in a hat, and drawn out in pairs, then leading to a one-game knockout competition similar to the NCAA Championships, which culminates in a Cup trophy. When soccer first started in the United States, it was played primarily by schoolboy and college teams, and was largely an upper-class game.<query> when was soccer first played</query> The Oneida soccer club, formed in Boston in 1862 is often cited as the first soccer club to consist of a regular roster of players, as opposed to the pick-up games commonly played at the time. It consisted of a group of Boston secondary school students from fairly elite public schools in the area (Boston Latin, Boston English, etc.). This club would play matches against pickup teams throughout the Boston collegiate community and went undefeated, and unscored upon during their entire four-year existence. Apparently, teamwork, and familiarity with teammates was a significant factor in winning, and this was not lost on the public. The Oneida Football Club was the first soccer club anywhere outside of England, even predating the formation of Scottish teams. Clubs soon spread to other collegiate communities. The College Era, and Rules Consolidation, 1862-1875 Collegiate play resumed on a regular basis after the Civil War.<query> when was the oneida soccer team formed</query> The attention snowballed in a positive way this time, through 1976 and 1977. As attendance climbed and more world stars were signed, vital media attention drew record numbers of fans, culminating with 77,691 for a 1977 playoff game between the Cosmos and the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers at Giants stadium. This was a truly golden era. A key development through the 1970's was the rapid growth of soccer as a youth participation sport. Soccer was relatively inexpensive as well as democratic -- it did not require specialists, tall players or behemoths as many of the other sorts did, and youth soccer did not have the overly competitive stigma and the political mudslinging that was plaguing Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. The parallel growth of the NASL, and youth (as well as adult) soccer really portended a golden era for the sport in the US, which unfortunately was premature at least from the professional game's point of view.<query> when did soccer become a sport</query> Rules varied widely among different schools and communities; Princeton played with 25 players, some people even played a game with innings, with a victory going to the first team to score a fixed number of goals (a la volleyball). In 1866, Beadle & Company of New York published a set of rules for both Association Football (soccer) and the ""Handling game"" (Rugby). The first intercollegiate game using rules resembling modern game was played on November 7, 1869 in New Brunswick, NJ between Princeton and Rutgers (Rutgers won 6-4). This game used the London Football Association's 1863 rules which called for, among other things, 25 players, a field 110 meters x 70 meters, a 24 foot wide goal, movement of the ball allowed with all parts of the body (including hands, ball could be batted or held, but not carried or thrown).<query> when was the first football game</query> First team to score 6 points won. Interestingly, this same game is also generally recognized as the first GRIDIRON FOOTBALL game as well. Soccer was also taken up at this time by Yale, Columbia and Cornell, and reintroduced to Harvard in 1871 in a hybrid form known as the Boston Game, a version that also allowed the throwing and carrying of the ball. At this time, football was still played by a number of different and conflicting rules. In 1873, inspired by the English Football Association's rules unification, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and Rutgers met in New York to draw up a uniform set of rules based on the London 1863 rules. They established 20 players on a team, a field measuring 400 feet x 250 feet, 25-foot wide goal, 6 goals to win, and a point scored by passing the goal past the goal posts.<query> when was football first played</query> Carrying the ball was prohibited. Shortly after the first game under these rules, a Yale victory over Princeton, an English team, the Eton Players visited New Haven and played Yale, to whom they lost 1-2, in the first Anglo-American international match. Yale was persuaded to adopt the English custom of 11 players to a side, and subsequently argued for its universal adoption, which was generally achieved by 1880. Meanwhile, Harvard had become more interested in the Rugby form of the game, and looked for competition against similarly oriented teams. When they happened upon McGill University of Montreal, who had also adopted those rules, the two teams played the first intercollegiate rugby match in 1874. The second of these games was played with an oval ball under English Rugby Association rules, and marks the evolution of soccer into the modern gridiron game.<query> when was rugby first played</query> A fateful event which would forever change the fortunes of American soccer took place in 1875 when Yale Harvard and bridged the game gap to play a match under special concessionary rules, which included both goals and tries (later touchdowns), and a 15 man roster. Harvard won 4 goals to none and 4 tries to none. Yale reassessed their position after this humiliation, and decided to adopt the Rugby code. Princeton, (who had watched the game as observers) were impressed enough to follow suit. In 1876, Harvard, Princeton and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football Association using Rugby rules. Stevens, Wesleyan and Penn soon followed, and the end of 1876 had signed the death knell signed for collegiate soccer in the US. The Working-Class and Immigrant Eras, 1875-1894 After the demise of college soccer, the game lay primarily in the hands of working-class communities, who were rapidly adopting the game, as the upper classes increasingly looked to rugby/gridiron.<query> when did college soccer start</query>"

Joined: 31/01/2003 Hi Folks I was talking to Steve and he agreed that we should have a book review list that stays stuck at the top of this forum.<query> who is steve mcknight</query> it was a money programme and the guy was talking about how he'd just started learning about investing and the best book he'd read which explained how it works simply was the above book. i raced out and bought it the next day and I loved how it gave a case study of an average family with some equity in their own home who leveraged it into a million dollars in 8 years (i.e. after eight years they owned property worth 1.8 million bu only owed 800k.) it was the first time I started to really get how property investors use the banks' money to make money. Rich Dad Poor Dad robert kiyosaki rating 10 i could go on and on about this book - but the main thing i feel is that reading this book 're-programmed' me for financial success, considering that I was pretty much the opposite at the time of reading the book.<query> how does robert kiyosaki's book work</query> As soon as i finished the book the world seemed different, and full of opportunities which i started to see everywhere, and which i had never seen before. What i got out of the book was a state of mind I call 'entrepreneur consciousness' . Life-changing? well, life is more than $$$. but it was life-changing to me in the $$$ department. The one-minute millionaire Robert Allen and Mark Victor Hansen rating 10 So much more than a $$$ book. On one of the first pages, they say 'the object of this book is to create one million enlightened millionaires (who give 10 percent to the community.) we believe this has the potential to change the economic future of the entire world.' After reading about the number of jobs the average millionaire creates (6) and thinking about the increased energy to the economy, I can totally see that being possible.<query> who wrote the one minute millionaire</query> they further explain this 'butterfly effect' as it's called. the book also aligns the ideas of wanting to be wealthy with living in integrity with the world and doing only good, which was a biggie for me. Also, it's just plain old empowering. the rubber band trick alone (put a band on your wrist and snap it every time you have a negative self-image thought, wearing it every day for 30 days without taking it off) was worth the purchase price.

This book influenced my decision to get right out of residential property and into the much more stimulating genre of commercial. Bob Jones is sarcastic, witty and thoroughly inspirational. He somehow managed to finance and build a six story high rise in the Hutt area (north of Wellington) when he was in his early twenties, circa 1962.

Making Money Made Simple by Noel Whittaker If you're a beginner to investing and can only afford to buy one book, this is the one to get! Written by an Australian, it advocates careful budgeting, household debt reduction, saving, investing, and if you wish to really accelerate your wealth journey, the use of borrowed money. Retire Young Retire Rich by Robert Kiyosaki Deals with the importance of replacing your employment income with passive income to become financially independent. There are some useful ratios given that can measure progress towards financial independence. Some of his approaches could be regarded as either high-risk (for instance quitting your job to pursue full-time investing with little capital, rather than remaining at work and saving heavily) or unethical (eg stance towards insider trading).<query> who wrote the book retire young retire rich</query> Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki The most well-known of a series of books by this prolific author. A story about how the young Kiyosaki was coached by his friend's wealthy father. There is some doubt as to whether 'Rich Dad' really existed (look up John T Reed on the web!) but the book is very readable and despite what detractors say it has given many people the kick they needed to begin their investment journey. His definition of assets and liabilities is interesting; most controversially it does not regard the family home as an asset as it generates no income. Kiyosaki emphasises the need for financial education, saying that traditional schooling equipped people to work for money rather than have money to work for them. The Millionaire Mind by Thomas Stanley Probably No 2 on your list, this is a rigorous study of over 700 US millionaires.<query> who wrote rich dad poor dad</query> It describes how they got there (most were self-made), their choice of career or profession, attitudes towards spending and even how they found their spouse. This book is a companion volume to 'The Millionaire Next Door' which is also recommended. The Richest Man in Babylon by George Classon Possibly the earliest personal finance book and regarded as a classic by many. A fable that well explains the basic principle of investing, ie spending less than you earn and wisely investing the difference. **Property From 0 to 130 properties in 3.5 Years by Steve McKnight Advocates buying rental properties (mostly outside the major cities) that are so cheap that they make money for you from day one. This differs from some other investors who regard capital gain as most important and are happy to lose money in the interim.<query> who is the richest man in babylon</query> The book is very strong on assessing the profitabilty of deals and explains different approaches to property investing (eg buy and hold, renovating, lease options, wraps) well. Because the emphasis is on fast financial independence, McKnight emphasises purchasing dozens of (profit-making) properties so that you can retire before your loans are paid out. This differs from others who will either defer retirement until the loans have been paid or hope for a capital gain so they can sell the property at a profit for their retirement nest-egg. However if the quest for positive cashflow forces the purchase of run-down houses in one-horse towns (something McKnight himself does not advocate) then maintenance and vacancy risks are magnified. The book has less information on non-financial aspects of investing (eg choosing a property manager or inspecting properties), but fortunately other books on this list fill the gap.<query> why is mcknight's book a good read</query> How to Create an Income for Life by Margaret Lomas Like McKnight, Lomas advocates the purchase of cheaper positive cashflow real estate to replace your salary when you retire. However unlike McKnight, Lomas is happy to accept a before tax loss provided that this translates to a profit after tax. This is mostly achieved by buying post 1985 properties that qualify for building depreciation allowance. This is fine if you are on a high income and/or intend to keep working for a while, but heavy reliance on tax benefits can cost dearly if you stop working. The merit of Lomas' approach however is that 'after tax cashflow positive' properties are easier to find than 'before tax cashflow positive' and that such properties may be more tenantable and/or have better growth prospects. The book also outlines variations in sale procedures between states, something that is important as the author is not hesitant to buy interstate property sight-unseen.<query> who is margaret lomas</query> Investing in Real Estate by McLean & Eldred An American book that's very thorough and devoid of hype. Once you've made allowances for the different terminology, financing and tax arrangements in the US, it is an excellent read with very clear explanations. It advocates a conservative approach based on (i) never assuming sustained high capital growth, (ii) beware of negative cash flows, (iii) don't over-extend yourself (iv) never over-pay for property. Three very usable approaches to valuing property are also presented. There is also a caution against the uncritical acceptance of 'nothing down' deals as championed by another American, Robert Allan. Ordinary Millionaires by Jim McKnight A compilation of stories from people who started with little but by hook or crook (in a few cases) became millionaires through investment property.<query> who is the author of investing in real estate</query> Common threads seem to be (i) borrow to buy as much property as you can to hold onto as long as you can (ii) look for new uses for properties that others may have overlooked and (iii) the importance of acting decisively. More Wealth from Residential Property by Jan Somers Explains the worth of residential property when held as a sound long-term investment. Agrees with the Wakelins that it normally doubles in value over seven to ten years and suggests using equity in your own home as a deposit. However Somers advocates the purchase of affordable property and (rightly) points out that both gain and yield emphases can work, and the right mix depends more on the investor's circumstances. This author has written several other property books, including 'Building Wealth: Story by Story' which are personal accounts from numerous investors.<query> how long does it take for a house to double in value</query> Investing in property Clitheroe, Paul.

Incredible eye-opener into real estate agents & institutions. The author has a very cynical view of the real estate industry. Would have rated higher, but I don't agree with the author's investment philosophy. How to create an income for life Lomas, Margaret. My rating: 8 Not a bad book, but I felt a bit let down by the fact that the author only has $1.2 mil worth of real estate after so long.<query> what is the author's view of real estate</query> Seven Steps to Wealth by John Fitzgerald A slim volume that emphasises that the key to capital growth is land, and purchasers should buy inner-suburban properties with large land components to maximise growth. In practice this means houses or duplexes rather than flats or villas. Advocates buying and holding, then selling a couple of houses to pay off debt on retirement. Streets Ahead by Monique and Richard Wakelin Unabashed advocates for capital growth for all investors, regardless of circumstance; any other approach will fail! Recommends purchase of well-located inner-suburban properties with scarcity value and archietectual merit that are likely to grow in value over the longer term. Though the approach recommended could produce excellent result for readers on secure middle to high incomes who intend to retire in 15 or more years time, it is not for every investor and the authors should openly acknowledge this.<query> who wrote streets ahead</query> Nevertheless, 'Streets Ahead' still has much to offer and is recommended. The Property Investors Handbook by Graham Airey This book recommends a capital growth-based approach, with high yields being equated with high risk. The other books reviewed emphasise that almost anyone willing to do the work can become a property investor. Airey is more conservative, with a quiz that almost says that if you are young, on a modest income, don't already own a house and don't live in a capital city you need not bother! After page 11 though, it gets better, with the remaining 200 plus pages being very useful. It's main strength is the breadth of topics covered, which are not included in other books. For example, there is coverage given to commercial property, 'less traditional' property investments, leases, property trusts, selling property, the GST and more.<query> who is graham airey</query> Understanding Investment Property by Nick Renton A large and thorough volume by a well-qualified author whose professional expertise extends to most facets of investment and accounting. As hinted by the boring cover, large number of pages and refreshing lack of hype, this volume is more serious than some of the other books reviewed here. The book's main strength is that it takes a balanced approach, pointing out the pitfalls as well as the benefits of property investing and borrowing money. Unlike some property authors who say that shares are risky and not worth investing in, Renton avocates both share and property ownership as part of a balanced portfolio. The investment style advocated is similar to Airey in that Renton favours investing for capital growth and equates yield with risk. However as the book was written in 2000, the yields used as examples would now only be obtainable in outer suburban or country areas.<query> who is nick renton</query> Renton is more conservative than Wakelin or Fitzgerald when it comes to borrowing and the heavy use of negative gearing and other tax deductions. Again like Airey, helpful chapters on commercial property, the GST and more are included. Your Investment Property by Anita Bell Be verrry suspicious of everyone, scrimp, save and buy dirt cheap! These seem to be the keys to Bell's approach. You can almost sense this without reading a word; her books are printed on poor quality paper, the price is kept low and a lot is packed in between its covers. Bell's main technique is the rapid repayment of loans. Though this lessens tax deductions, she points out that the interest savings are greater and you can buy and pay off your second property even quicker (with two lots of rent helping). What most appealed about this book was its down-to-earth style and thoroughness on matters such as inspecting properties.<query> who is anita bell</query> The financing approach recommended limits the number of properties that can be bought at any one time, but for the new investor her conservative approach is sound.

This book is pitched at positive cashflow property investing. Written in layman terms and easy to read. ""How to Research and Purchase Investment Properties"" By Debra Lohrere. This e-book is written by an Australian author. I found it extremely informative for a first time investor. It had a lot of useful information about the different demographic groups and showed how low end, median priced and high end properties can all be used by investors. ""Real Estate Riches"" By Dolf De Roos.<query> who wrote the book how to make your money last as long as you do</query> From the Rich Dad/Kiyosaki stable, but a New Zealand/Dutch writer, a nice inspiring and motivational read that says property is 10-100 times better than shares. I liked the 100:10:3:1 ratio - you may look at 100 properties, put offers on 10, arrange finance for 3, to actually buy 1, but that purchase should increase your net worth immediately by $x0,000's. Says the 'deal of the decade' comes along about once a week. Also puts the case for Commercial property for experienced investors. ""Rental Property and Taxation"" By Tony Compton. I found this an excellant book to help you learn the very basics of accounting toward owning rental properties and how it effects taxation. It goes into what you can claim, how to keep records. It provides practical and sound advice in an easily read manner.<query> how much is a property worth</query> The reader is taken through the purchase, the tax return and the sale. A checklist is provided to help ensure that deductions are claimed in full. This is a read for any owner of, or anyone considering purchasing, a rental property. This book takes an unbiased and objective look at the tax effect of a loss from a rental property. ""Seven Steps to Wealth"" By John L Fitzgerald. Jargon-free, and presented in a ""how to"" manner, this book has some interesting ideas. Easier to read but somewhat lighter than Jan Somer'sbooks. A tad pro-Brisbane for some people's tastes, but read it with an open mind. ""Renton’s Understanding Investment Property"" N. E. Renton 3rd ed. Information Australia. 2000. Approx. $32.95 Nick Renton has produced an extraordinary number of books about law and investment in Australia, including titles relating to wills, negative gearing, family trusts, and the stock market.<query> who wrote seven steps to wealth</query> Your real estate jargon explained : tricks, traps and insider hints Bell, Anita, 1967- My rating: 7 quite useful little pocket book, sometimes humorously written Secrets of property investment : secrets 1-5 : successful strategies for creating wealth through property investment Doidge, Geoff. My rating: 6 quite vague, but a few useful tips Property power Barnes, Leonard. My rating: 8 Emphasis on timing market cycles for a buy-and-sell strategy. How to sell your home for more : (and buy your next for less) Wood, Ray, 1960- My rating: 7 Real money real estate : winning the real estate game Sugars, Bradley J. My rating: 9 Great book! Featuring NLP, motivation, etc... More than just a real estate book.<query> what is the real estate jargon</query> In this book, he explains the various aspects of property investing. It is not a ""how-to"" book, but more of a ""what-is"" book. Renton explains the risks and economic factors to consider when investing in property trusts, parking spaces, mortgages, and both commercial and residential property, amongst other topics. This 496 page volume is very thorough, but quite readable, although it probably wouldn’t make for the best casual reading. The occasional touches of dry humour I found surprising and delightful. Understanding Investment Property is ideally suited as a reference tool, for investigating different classes of property investment as opportunities become available. Hence you could probably just borrow this book from a library or a friend as needed, rather than purchase it yourself. ""Real Estate Mistakes"" Neil Jenman 1st ed.<query> what is understanding investment property</query> Griffin Press. February 2000. Approx. $21.80 Neil Jenman is obviously revolted by the typical real estate agent approach. In this book, he goes to great lengths to explain why this approach is bad for buyers, bad for sellers, bad for agents, and unethical to boot. He convincingly argues that auctions are a bad idea for sellers, and likewise open inspections and mass advertising. He also provides useful tips for buyers to use when negotiating with unskilled agents and at auctions. This is not a book oriented around property investing, but around the buying and selling of one’s home. Jenman doesn’t advocate looking for bargains, paying agents cheaply, or seeking to pay much less than you might be able to afford when buying, and this is to some extent related to the book’s focus. However, the education afforded by reading this book will prove useful to all those who buy or sell property.<query> who is neil jenman</query> An interesting read which tells you a lot of what you didn't know about buying and selling real estate. I lent this to a friend recently who then advertised his house privately for sale at ""offers around $515k"". I wondered about this, and nearly fell over when I found out he had negotiated with several interested parties himself and ended up selling it within three weeks for $565k ! He thanked me for the loan (of the book...). I don't buy the Jenman system, which appears to be a variety of real estate agent which turns off as many buyers as it attracts, but I found the content of this book different, thought provoking and memorable. Not expensive at RRP $19.95 - recommended. ""Building Wealth Story by Story"" Jan Somers Somerset Financial Services Pty Ltd. September 1998.<query> what is the jenman system</query> Approx. $26.95 Jan Somers is one of the high profile residential property investment successes in Australia, and this is the third in her series of books for encouraging others to succeed like she has. There are 101 different arguments for why property investment is worthwhile, presented in the form of short anecdotes. It contains nuggets of information that makes it worth reading, but the amateur ""Microsoft Word""-type layout detracts slightly from the professional content. Somers’ approach is to build equity through capital growth, using rental income to balance interest payments in the short term - no predictive ability should be required. Her company sells financial software packages to assist with these calculations, and some of the anecdotes concern the software. The view that ""anyone can do it"" is emphatically presented, and would be a good introductory read for those considering or just beginning with residential property investment.<query> why is jan somers book worth reading</query> ""Anyone Can Be A Millionaire"" by Sean O'Reilly. Great read. He also does the occasional seminar and well worth attending if you get the chance. I liked this book because it was easy to read and covered property investment and shares, not just one or the other. It is basically about how he made his money by investing in property and shares and looks at insurance etc as well. It was only about $19 to buy so was fairly cheap. ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter TechPress Inc. 1998. Approx. $19.95 This book is the first in Robert Kiyosaki’s trilogy of investment guides. He is always very careful not to advocate a particular path to building wealth, but instead tries to teach a mindset for achieving great wealth. Specifically, the mindset of the very rich, based on his own experiences and the teachings of his ""rich dad"".<query> who wrote anyone can be a millionaire</query> Rich Dad Poor Dad lays the educational foundation for the other two volumes, although it stands on its own as an eye-opening and very enjoyable read. Through defining assets, liabilities, balance sheets, and income statements in simple ways, Kiyosaki conveys the basics of financial literacy from the point of view that ""cashflow is king"". It doesn’t try to be consistent with typical accountancy teachings, but strives to highlight the aspects of one’s personal finances that should be given priority. It’s a book that could’ve done with a proper editing, but has noble goals, and should be required reading for all those contemplating a life of employment, at the very least for the fresh perspective on investing that it brings. ""The CASHFLOW Quadrant"" Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter TechPress Inc. 1998. Approx.<query> who wrote the book the cashflow quadrant</query> $19.95 In this second guide, Kiyosaki introduces four classifications of people based on how they earn income. These classifications form the quadrant for which the book is named. People ""on the left side"" of the quadrant earn income directly from their own labour. Those on the right side earn income through others’ labour. This book discusses the steps to take in order to move oneself from the left to the right side of the quadrant, particularly to the classification based around earning income from investing where the greatest potential income streams can be found at the lowest risk. Kiyoski seeks to help people understand themselves better, and through this understanding improve themselves to eventually control their personal financial situations. ""Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing"" Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter TechPress Inc. 2000. Approx.<query> what is the right side of the income quadrant</query> $21.90. In Kiyosaki’s third guide, the final in the series to date, he tells the tale of how he learned his financial skills, both from his ""rich dad"" and through his own life. He notes that there is no magic formula, and becoming a successful businessman or investor is hard work. Kiyosaki discusses the need for planning, support from a clever team of financial/business professionals, and what different types of investors do (the best types of investor have more control over their investments). He now works at being the type of investor that takes companies public, profiting from the sales of their shares, but he has previously been the type of investor that buys into businesses, and this is the type of investor that he recommends for most people. This book solidifies the theories presented in the previous two guides, and gives real advice on how to ""do"" what the best investors do, compared with the previous books that focussed more on how to ""be"" a good investor.<query> what type of investor is kiyosaki</query> ""House Hunting"" Jerry Tyrrell 2nd ed. Allen & Unwin. 1997. Approx. $16.95 In this brief but comprehensive guide, Jerry Tyrrell draws on his experience as a property inspector to provide step by step advice on how to purchase residential property. He discusses topics such as choosing a property, engaging professional help, bidding strategies at auction, legal considerations, choosing a loan, and moving in. There is an emphasis on the use of property inspections, and you may come away from the book believing that the most important step in acquiring property is the property inspection. However, the book gives a very thorough treatment to many of the issues, and may require later reference as a buyer steps through the purchase process in order to make full use of the book. ""How to Own Your Home Years Sooner!"" H. Gill and S. Therry 2nd ed.<query> who is jerry tyrrell</query> I.G.C. (Aust). 1997. Reviewed: November 2000 Approx. $24.95 This short book covers the simple mathematical principles behind housing loans. From this basis, the authors explain the now well known benefits of Offset and Line Of Credit loans. Gill and Therry are mortgage brokers and they are apparently frustrated with how banks sucker people into home loans that cost them a lot. They outline the benefits of the different home loan structures available from banks, list the typical lending criteria used by banks and how to calculate them, show how to keep track of personal expenses and choose the best home loan, and offer tips for paying off a loan quickly. This book is great for those trying to tell the difference between the banks’ loans, and although is helpful for increasing investors’ understanding of loans, is ideally suited for those looking for a home loan.<query> what is the benefit of a offset loan</query> More wealth from residential property Somers, Jan (Jan B.)

Wrightbooks. 2000. Approx. $32.90 This book is an extended, scholarly discussion on the economic forces that affect changes in the residential housing industry. The subtitle of the book (Understanding the market in the New Millennium) more accurately reflects the contents than the title does. There is very little guidance on how to invest in residential property - most of the issues discussed are things that the average investor has very little control over, eg. current account deficit, interest rates, taxation or migration levels. However, this book teaches an economic perspective of the housing industry, something that is relatively uncommon. It is filled with facts, figures and tables, and at times can be quite overwhelming. I came away with an appreciation for how complicated the economic environment is, and the difficulty in making predictions about the medium-to-long term future of residential property investing.<query> what is the economics of residential property</query> Although too heavy to be a beginners’ introduction, its completeness makes this book a worthwhile read for the investor serious about understanding the risks inherent in property. ""Making Money"" Paul Clitheroe 4th ed. (Year 2000 edition) Penguin Books Australia. 1999. Reviewed: April 2001 Approx. $24.95 Eventually all media personalities get around to writing a book, and so it’s no real surprise that financial planner come television presenter, Paul Clitheroe, has become an author as well. The surprise is how good the book is. It isn’t light reading, but it is aimed squarely at the novice investor. Clitheroe covers both investing philosophy and technique, including topics such as saving, tax, property, shares, and retirement. Although his favourite forms of investing are superannuation and managed funds, he provides reasonable arguments for these without ignoring other alternatives.<query> who is paul clitheroe</query> The more involved (and perhaps profitable) investing techniques are not really covered, but the level of detail provided should easily protect the unwary from some of the self-proclaimed gurus around. If you want a sensible backgrounder to investing in general, then this one is for you. ""Common Sense on Mutual Funds"" John C. Bogle John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999. Reviewed: June 2001 Approx. $56.00 John Bogle started Vanguard in the mid 1970s, the first fund company to operate a public fund based on a stock market index, and has been a crusader for index funds ever since. In this regrettably wordy and repetitive book, he provides a compelling argument for avoiding investing in actively managed funds, and details the historical and philosophical background of the Vanguard group of funds.<query> who started vanguard mutual funds</query> His argument is addressed to those who wish to have their money invested without fuss for the long term: there is no way to tell in advance which managed funds will perform the best in the short-term, all funds will perform at best equivalent to the market before costs long-term, and actively managed funds cost substantially more than passively managed funds. Hence low- cost, passively managed funds, such as index funds, are the preferred investment vehicle. The argument and conclusion are supported by copious figures and charts, and as a result this book will appeal to the more academically-inclined investor. ""Family Trusts"" N. E. Renton 2nd ed. Wrightbooks. 2001. Reviewed: September 2001 Approx. $27.95 Nick Renton has again written a very detailed book to help investors understand the intricacies around an aspect of Australian law.<query> why are family trusts preferred</query> This is the most popular general book for understanding how to use trusts, but it has a bias heavily towards family trusts, as indicated by the title. So if you aren’t interested in setting up a family trust, you will have to wade through much irrelevant material. Another issue is the dynamic situation with respect to taxation of trusts recently. This book was completed after it was determined that legislation to tax trusts as companies was to be postponed indefinitely, but not all of paragraphs in this book are as recent - this minor fault is not a concern if you read the whole book. Until specialist books or pamphlets are prepared for different investors and their needs concerning trusts, this is an essential text to read before meeting with your accountant or solicitor. ""Smarter Property Investment"" Peter Cerexhe Allen & Unwin.<query> why is it important to read the book trusts</query> 2001. Reviewed: November 2001 Approx. $24.95 This down-to-earth book, written by ex-solicitor Peter Cerexhe, contains something for any but the most experienced property investor. The focus on both residential property and buying for investment makes this book especially valuable compared with other property or investment books. Areas covered include tax considerations, CBD vs. suburbs, steps involved in buying well, and various strategies for different types of investor. This book may scare off the novice investor, and does not contain any ground-breaking new approaches, but strives (and I believe, succeeds) in being sensible. It is especially suited towards people who already own some property and want to invest in additional property. ""The Richest Man In Babylon"" George S. Clason Signet. 1988.<query> who wrote the richest man in babylon</query> Reviewed: December 2001 Approx. $16.95 Beloved by millions, this bestselling book reveals the success secrets of the ancients and has been hailed as the greatest inspirational work on the subject of thrift, financial planning, and personal wealth. George Clason, credited with the production of the U.S.A’s first road atlas, was an avid publisher, and created a number of pamphlets on financial self-help. Many of these pamphlets (originally written as long ago as 1926) have been collected into this book as chapters. Also unusual, is that this book is basically a work of fiction - each chapter tells a different story based on characters from Babylon. Arkad the money lender, Dabasir the camel trader, Sharru Nada the merchant price, and others tell their tales of how they overcame adversity and became successful. Although this theme is presented repeatedly, it is still an engaging and interesting book, and reminded me of Rich Dad Poor Dad in many ways.<query> who wrote the first road atlas</query> Clason presents his advice with equal parts of motivation and education, and should capture the imagination of those who have yet to establish a financial plan. ""The One Minute Millionaire"" by Mark Victor Hansen and Robert G. Allen This book gives a fantastic insight into joint ventures and how team dynamics can work. Very inspiring too. If you are doing or contemplating Joint Ventures, this is worth a read. ""The E-Myth Revisited"" by Michael Gerber Michael Gerber dispels the myths surrounding starting your own business and shows how commonplace assumptions can get in the way of running a business. Next, he walks you through the steps in the life of a business - from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed - and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise.<query> who wrote the e myth</query> Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. ""How To Be Rich"" J. Paul Getty Jove Books. 1983. Reviewed: February 2002 Approx. $15.00 Self-made billionaire Paul Getty was once credited with being the richest man in the world, and here he presents some of his philosophies on life. The book is not titled ""how to become rich"" since that isn't its focus, and contains Getty's advice about the sort of person you should be, if you are rich or to be rich. Intelligently written, it presents the gritty reality of Getty's accomplishments, and the good and bad sides of being successful in business. Although targeted mainly at the novice in business, it has wide appeal, and in separate chapters also covers Getty's opinions on investing in stocks, real estate, and fine art.<query> who is the richest man in the world</query> ""The Millionaire Next Door"" Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko Longstreet Press, 1997. Reviewed: May 2002 These are the real secrets of America’s rich and not so famous. The authors are academics who have conducted several surveys of affluent America, and have discovered that a majority are not living a glamorous lifestyle, but instead are obsessively frugal and avidly investing. They have the appearance of a traditional worker husband-homemaker wife couple, living in an average home in an averagely decent suburb. The authors suspect that the internal drive that makes them live this relatively humble lifestyle is responsible for their prodigious wealth. The chapter on how children of wealthy parents fare is very telling, with those who become dependent on an easy life finding it hard to become motivated to create their own success. Although more descriptive than prescriptive, this is an interesting look at how the average successful people live, and good for investors finding it hard to defer lifestyle purchases.<query> who wrote the millionaire next door</query> My rating: 7 Property on the net Airey, Graham J., 1966- My rating: 6 more of a reference book. quite out-dated also. *didn't finish this one* The Penguin Australian home buyer's guide Humphrey, Nicholas, 1971- My rating: 7 clear, step-by-step explanations Buying and selling off-the-plan in Queensland Blue, Christopher My rating: 5 too boring to even finish reading. aimed at developers.

Written in a casual but thorough style and filled throughout with pithy quotations, it guides the reader towards higher levels of investor skill. Burley’s seven levels of investor range from non-investor (zero) through the passive investor (three) up to the capitalist (six), and supplies strategies for moving step-by-step up the ranks.

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority. Further proposals include transformation to a Social Enterprise. These proposals provide the opportunity for future community health services to be provided through Integrated Care Partnerships (ICPs) ensuring better partnership working with different organisations developing healthcare services together. All Primary Care Trusts including NHS Northamptonshire will complete the transformation by April 2011.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results. Not all hospitals are able to provide this level of care or see enough patients, so it's worth travelling further to a hospital that can. It has not yet been decided where in the East Midlands these Specialist Centres will be. Each hospital has been asked if they are able to offer a specialist 24/7 service and we are talking to patients and health professionals before we make any decisions. As part of the commitment to seeking public opinion we're inviting the public to a NHS East Midlands-led workshop, where we will give an overview of the current system and outline our initial thoughts on what a new system would look like. The workshop will give you the opportunity to raise any questions and give us your feedback on the plans.<query> where is a specialist centre in nhs</query> The workshop will take place on Friday 27 November at Wellingborough Museum commencing at 10am with refreshments.

Firstly, the car industry gives many people in the world jobs and helps countries to develop. Secondly, many people today need cars in their work. Doctors need to visit patients, salespeople need to visit customers and computer technicians need to visit businesses. In conclusion, although cars can cause problems it is impossible to live without them in modern life. The chart shows the fluctuations in the numbers of international students attending the Sydney International Language Centre in 2001. At the start of the year numbers were quite high at 170, this was because there were a large number of students in University Preparation (UP) before the March intake. The student population remained the same until the end of February when 40 graduated from ELI and took up their offers in Bachelors and Masters courses.<query> how do cars help the economy</query> In both April and May, 15 extra students enrolled into ELI courses. There was a sharp increase in June when 20 new students entered UP courses. In July there was only an increase of five students as the Winter course intake was at the end of July and this was too late for students who were entering university in the second semester. In comparison to the first semester, there was a sharp drop in numbers as 50 students left, leaving only 135 students in ELI for August. From here until the end of the year there was a steady rise in student numbers to a peak of 180 in December. Overall it shows steady growth when compared to the 2000 enrolments.

Cars traveling on Interstate highways can expect to be stopped, with traffic backed up for miles, while Homeland Security and the federalized state or local police conduct searches. I witnessed one such warrantless search on Easter Sunday. The south bound lanes of I-185 heading into Columbus, Georgia, were at a standstill while black SUV and police car lights flashed. US citizens were treated by “security” forces that they finance as if they were “terrorists” or “domestic extremists,” another undefined class of Americans devoid of constitutional protections. These events are Kafkaesque in themselves, but they are ever more so when one considers that these extraordinary violations of the US Constitution fail to be overturned in the Supreme Court. Apparently, American citizens lack standing to defend their civil liberties.<query> why are citizens treated as terrorists</query> Yet, ObamaCare is before the US Supreme Court. The conservative majority might now utilize the “judicial activism” for which conservatives have criticized liberals. Hypocrisy should no longer surprise us. However, the fight over ObamaCare is not worth five cents. It is extraordinary that “liberals,” “progressives,” “Democrats,” whatever they are, are defending a “health program” that uses public monies to pay private insurance companies and that raises the cost of health care. Americans have been brainwashed that “a single-payer system is unaffordable” because it is “socialized medicine.” Despite this propaganda, accepted by many Americans, European countries manage to afford single-payer systems. Health care is not a stress, a trauma, an unaffordable expense for European populations. Among the Western Civilized Nations, only the richest, the US, has no universal health care.<query> why is single payer health care unaffordable</query> The American health care system is the most expensive of all on earth. The reason for the extraordinary expense is the multiple of entities that must make profits. The private doctors must make profits. The private testing centers must make profits. The private specialists who receive the referrals from general practitioners must make profits. The private hospitals must make profits. The private insurance companies must make profits. The profits are a huge cost of health care. On top of these profits come the costs of preventing and combatting fraud. Because private insurance companies resist paying and Medicare pays a small fraction of the medical charges, private health care providers charge as much as they possibly can, knowing that the payments will be cut to the bone. But a billing mistake of even $300 can bankrupt a health care provider from legal expenses defending him/her self from fraud accusations.<query> why is the american health care system the most expensive</query> The beauty of a single-payer system is that it takes the profits out of the system. No one has to make profits. Wall Street cannot threaten insurance companies and private health care companies with being taken over because their profits are too low. No health-provider in a single-payer system has to worry about being displaced in a takeover organized by Wall Street because the profits are too low. Because a single-payer system eliminates the profits that drive up the costs, Wall Street, Insurance companies, and “free market economists” hate a “socialized” medical care system. They prefer a socialized “private” health care system in which public monies flow into private insurance companies. To make the costs as high as possible, conservatives and the private insurance companies devised ObamaCare. The bill was written by conservative think tanks and the private insurance companies.<query> why is single payer health care a good idea</query> What the “socialistic” ObamaCare bill does is to take income taxes paid by citizens and use the taxes to subsidize the private medical premiums charges by private health care providers in order to provide “private” health care to US citizens who cannot afford it. The extremely high costs of ObamaCare is not “socialistic medicine.” ObamaCare is high-cost privatized medicine that guarantees billions of dollars in profits to private insurance companies. It remains to be seen whether such a ridiculous health care scheme, nowhere extant on earth except in Romney’s Massachusetts, will provide health care or just private profits. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Paul Craig Roberts [<query> what is the socialistic obamacare bill</query> paulcraigroberts@yahoo.com ] was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during President Reagan’s first term.

This divide serves to keep us separate from each other and prevents us from seeing clearly that we in fact have shared interests and a common enemy. A better way to approach economy, politics, culture and society would be to take note of the ways in which our societies are divided horizontally: the interests of the few (the elite) and the many (ordinary people). The elite wants to oppress and exploit the rest of us. In a material sense, they are our enemy. They are working to establish aOne World Company, aka a totalitarian New World Order.

Growing up in the post-war era (after the Second World War), I never expected to live in the strange Kafkaesque world that exists today.<query> what is obamacare</query> The US government can assassinate any US citizen that the executive branch thinks could possibly be a “threat” to the US government, or throw the hapless citizen into a dungeon for the rest of his or her life without presenting any evidence to a court or obtaining a conviction of any crime, or send the “threat” to a puppet foreign state to be tortured until the “threat” confesses to a crime that never occurred or dies at the hands of “freedom and democracy” while professing innocence. It has never been revealed how a single citizen, or any number thereof, could possibly comprise a threat to a government that has a trillion plus dollars to spend each year on security and weapons, the world’s largest navy and air force, 700 plus military bases across the world, large numbers of nuclear weapons, 16 intelligence agencies plus the intelligence agencies of its NATO puppet states and the intelligence service of Israel.<query> what is the threat to the us government</query>"

Reforming the Reforms: Why the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Will Require Substantial Reform Paul Howard, Missouri Medicine Thu, 2011-03-17 ""Our current health care arrangements have many flaws, but we should not lose sight of the many blessings that come from the life saving and life lengthening technologies generated by the U.S. health care system.<query> what is the impact of obamacare</query> Reforming the reforms is our next task, one that I hope we will approach with more sobriety and less partisanship than has been our recent experience."" State Variation in Primary Care Physician Supply: Implications for Health Reform Medicaid Expansions Peter J. Cunningham, Center for Studying Health System Change Thu, 2011-03-17 ""Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Medicaid enrollment is expected to grow by 16 million people by 2019, an increase of more than 25 percent. Given the unwillingness of many primary care physicians (PCPs) to treat new Medicaid patients, policy makers and others are concerned about adequate primary care capacity to meet the increased demand. States with the smallest number of PCPs per capita overall—generally in the South and Mountain West—potentially will see the largest percentage increases in Medicaid enrollment, according to a new national study by the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC).<query> what is the effect of the ppaca on primary care physicians</query> In contrast, states with the largest number of PCPs per capita—primarily in the Northeast—will see more modest increases in Medicaid enrollment. Moreover, geographic differences in PCP acceptance of new Medicaid patients reflect differences in overall PCP supply, not geographic differences in PCPs’ willingness to treat Medicaid patients."" ObamaCare: The One-Year Checkup Brian Blase, The Heritage Foundation Thu, 2011-03-17 ""On its one-year anniversary, Obamacare’s unpopularity is growing. Its hodgepodge of mandates and regulations have reduced competition in health insurance markets and increased the cost of coverage. Overall, Obamacare has increased government control of Americans’ health care choices and limited consumer choice. The more than 1,000 waivers already granted tacitly acknowledge that Obamacare’s 'benefits' are not worth its costs. Congress should replace Obamacare with consumer-focused reforms and sensible changes in health care entitlement programs."" Secretary Sebelius Cannot Fix CLASS Brian Blase & John S. Hoff, The Heritage Foundation Wed, 2011-03-16 ""Among<query> how many waivers have been granted under obamacare</query> Obamacare’s hundreds of pages was tucked a new government-run long-term care program, the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Program. CLASS was poorly designed, and actuaries criticized it as being unsustainable well before the passage of ObamaCare. It appears from three recent congressional appearances by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that the Obama Administration has caught up with the actuarial analysis."" Why the Health Care Law Has Sparked a National Debate Over First Principles Robert E. Moffit, Ph.D., The Heritage Foundation Mon, 2011-03-14 ""But over the past two years, ordinary Americans have come to realize that Washington’s political class—the politicians and their staffs and the armies of lawyers and lobbyists and consultants that intermingle with them routinely—really have become distant from them in mind and heart; they have become disconnected in so many ways.<query> why has the health care law sparked a national debate over first principles?</query> That mental and emotional distance had become glaringly evident on many topics, such as record spending and deficits, but none so clearly as in the long and bitter national debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), the new national health care law."" Higher Costs and the Affordable Care Act: The Case of the Premium Tax Douglas Holtz-Eakin, American Action Forum Wed, 2011-03-09 ""The ACA contains insurance reforms, medical device taxes, pharmaceutical fees, and insurance company fees that will raise the cost of insurance for millions of individuals, small businesses and households. This analysis suggests that the insurance tax in isolation will raise premiums by roughly 3 percent. An important topic for future research is to perform similar analyses for the other cost-raising aspects of the ACA in order to assess the overall pressure on premiums."" ObamaCare in the Supreme Court Michael S. Greve, American Enterprise Institute Tue, 2011-03-01 ""Recent district court decisions have fueled speculation over what the Supreme Court will do about ObamaCare if and when one of the challenges to the law's 'individual mandate' arrives on the justices' doorstep.<query> what is the aca premium tax</query> Largely unnoticed amidst the agitation, though, cases that will have profound effects on ObamaCare's future are already pending before the Court. They involve enormous amounts of money, and they have powerful implications for the implementation of the criminally misnamed 'Affordable Care Act.' The justices will get these cases right, to good effect."" Negative Consequences of Health Law Force Health Insurers to Withdraw from Markets Across the Country Grace-Marie Turner, The Galen Institute Fri, 2011-02-25 ""The negative consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act already are cascading through the health sector, with millions of Americans in states across the country learning that their health insurers have withdrawn from the market, making it increasingly difficult for them to find affordable coverage.""

First the insurance industry is a sham we all know it but the President when he killed single payer he killed any real reform. Real reform would be health care by the Doctor not some pimp at Allstate or whomever. Also there are a lot of people who take their health care more seriously than the AMA What happens to the people using traditional medicine? The Europeans never figured that out. Obama says screw you or what? Since any trip to the doctor becomes a huge cost factor we know the insurance companies are interested in the bottom line not patient health.<query> who said screw you or what</query> America has excellent emergency medicine due to high investment in that sort of healing but long term illness we do very little with due to the strangle hold of Big Pharma. Big Pharma treats symptoms not illness. Then there is question of judicial corruption so rife the lawyers joke about who owns the Supreme Court this week. Justice Thomas known for his long time association with not only Republican causes but his paling with that known degenerate Dr. Hunter Thompson is a poster child judicial abuse charges.

Federal payments required by President Barack Obama’s health care law are being understated by as much as $50 billion per year because official budget forecasts ignore the cost of insuring many employees’ spouses and children, according to a new analysis. The result could cost the U.S. Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars during the first ten years of the new health care law’s implementation. “The Congressional Budget Office has never done a cost-estimate of this [because] they were expressly told to do their modeling on single [person] coverage,” said Richard Burkhauser in a telephone interview Monday.

You find mandated insurance reminiscent of the flawed European system. That system, imperfect as it may be, replaced what both modern Europeans and the fleeing colonists left behind; a Darwinian approach to public health that supplied the rich with all the medical care that money could buy, while leaving the poor to suffer and die. Since most people in this country have little appetite for the carnage this produces, it seems that someone must pay for universal health care.<query> what is dangerous, mr. c_t_c_d?</query> The question is: How and by whom will the price be paid? By the way, the free choice argument, specifically defending the libertarian's ""choice"" to remain uninsured, is a red herring. In the real world, no one with the means to buy health insurance chooses to remain uninsured. That ""choice"" is only made by people with no money, ergo no choice. And exactly what choice do the insured have when their premiums are increased to cover the bills the uninsured “choose” not to pay? +9 # MindDoc 2012-03-28 13:02 Now that I've seen the moral integrity of the SCOTUS's newest member, recusing herself more than once, I'm left with this burning question: Why does not the mute one of the presumed arch-conserviatives/partisans (aka ""Clarence Thomas"") recuse HIMself?<query> who is the scotus</query> It's so obviously the right thing to do, if that matters.

When you represent the millionaires and billionaires of our nation, well, health care isn't broken for them, is it? They don't even USE insurance, they can pay for the most expensive procedures out of their pocket change. The GOP are already trying to dismantle Medicare as it is, they certainly won't agree to its expansion to cover all Americans. And they are likely to have filibuster power in the Senate even IF the Dems take the House and can craft a Medicare-for-All legislation (not a foregone conclusion given how many corporatist Centrist Dems in the pocket of the HMO industry there are). This was our only chance of any HC reform, and it is being thrown out by 5 hyper-conservative partisans in black dresses.<query> who is trying to dismantle medicare</query> They will be hapless serfs like the rest of us.

Defeat of Obamacare will place this problem solely on the Republican side and they've backed themselves so far into a corner with their extremism they can't budge.<query> why is it happening that obamacare is defeated</query> What I don't understand is why corporations aren't demanding a single payer system from both parties. We have placed almost all of the middle class health care burden on employers and it's no longer affordable.

Down the road, historians will tell us a lot we don't know now about the folks at the top today and how they do their daily work. George Bush Jr. was a big picture guy with no time for intellectuals. So he didn't know what *Sunni* and *Shiite* mean until long after the Iraq war started. That never came up in the election campaign. +24 # Regina 2012-03-28 11:41 Isn't the yuk about broccoli enough of a diversion?<query> who was the least favorite president</query> The justices' boredom can only mean that their decisions are already set, as predicted, against the legislation. Maybe its defeat will mobilize a campaign to enact a sane single-payer system, like those in every developed country the world over. (Only in America could corporate clowns prevail over common sense, logic, and human decency.) +3 # bugbuster 2012-03-28 12:16 I agree with your viewpoint, but on the boredom question, I don't agree that you can infer anything from boredom in a real court. If you have ever sat on a jury, you know that courtroom drama mostly only happens on TV and movies. It's pretty dry and low key in a real courtroom. +3 # Regina 2012-03-28 13:50 I've served on juries in two counties a total of 10 times, and served as foreperson once; I've been empaneled but not selected on four additional occasions.<query> what is the meaning of boredom in court</query> Most of the cases were civil, not criminal. Most were indeed pretty dry and low key. None would have made it into TV or movies. None of the judges were concerned with broccoli, nor was there any other trace of sarcasm. I still expect the entrenched 5-4 decision against the ACA. +20 # Doctoretty 2012-03-28 10:17 First of all, for those of us who support the Affordable Care Act, the term should be ObamaCARES. Secondly, I agree that the SCOTUS deliberations are nonsense. We all know how they will turn out. My only hope is that if the mandate is overturned and this leads to dismantling of the whole law, it will open the door to real reform in a single payer system. +1 # MidwestTom 2012-03-28 12:08 This law would be good for the small companies and the common man, less so for the retired people, and the taxpayers.<query> what is the term for the aca</query> Remember that this was supposed to be controlling doctors pay since January 2010, and the savings were to accumulate before the benefits kicked in. Well guess shat, Congress refuses to address the issue and has passed monthly and quarterly exemptions resulting in no savings. I do not know the amount that was projected to have been saved by now, but it is large. +4 # Cassandra2012 2012-03-28 15:01 Yes, the acceptance of the Republican take-over of the language is mind-boggling. This is the AFFORDABLE Care Act, and calling it 'Obamacare' gives the Rovians what they want, control of the discourse itself. The questions that SHOULD be asked are: why it is taken for granted that the ravenous greed of the profiteering Insurance *INDUSTRY* , and the ""Market"" model are the correct economic models?<query> why is it called obamacare</query> Healthcare is a social/civil RIGHT given to its people by every CIVILIZED country in the world, BUT the US (and apparently South Africa.) Aside from the usual Rovian fear-mongering by calling it that old bogeyman, ""socialism"" or ""socialized medicine"" (by the way, police, fire, public education, libaries and social security are ""socialism"" by such a narrow rightwing radical partisan definition,too) the only rational solution is single-payer which eliminates the profiteering, self-serving , MORE EXPENSIVE insurance industry payoffs. Want to REALLY cut spending on health, get rid of the useless health insurance INDUSTRY and replace it with a Medicare for all model. Since when are health, education, and other socially motivated services ""industries""? except by the more backward MBA and economic models?<query> what is the rational solution to the health care system</query> +20 # Sensible1 2012-03-28 10:28 The irony is that if the republicans defeat the ObamaCare law, the President still wins, because the republicans will be blamed and it will impact the presidential election as well as congressional seats. I don't see how the President can lose this one. Millions of Americans now enjoy the effect of the current law, and millions are looking forward to the implementations to take effect in the future. Take that away from them and lose the votes. +31 # cherylpetro 2012-03-28 10:37 This is the Supreme Court that stuck us with Bush/Cheney to dump us into the hole from which we are still trying to recover!

clueweb12-0013wb-72-13536,68,1,"Online Debate: Anonymity in Computerized Classroom Discussions A Collaborative Online Discussion: Anonymity and Authorial Responsibility in Computerized Classrooms [Host:] We begin our discussion today with various individuals who have been invited to this virtual panel to express their views on the question of anonymity in a computerized classroom. Our guests includeKip Wheeler and Darren Reiley, both graduate students at the University of Oregon and teachers of Freshman composition. We also have joining our discussion Dr. Kali Hassensprenger , anarcha-feminist and author of the controversial new book,Outside-In Education: Thus Assessment doth make Asses of us All. Finally we are also honored to have joining us today, the distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philology and Antiquities, Dr. E. M. W. Mustcrotchette . [ Host]: Now as I understand it, there has been an ongoing debate in English 608 concerning matters of anonymity in electronic classrooms.<query> anonymous classroom discussion</query> Assessing learning is a means of facilitating learning, if done appropriately. And how can we be sure that the actual facilitation of learning is going on in the anonymity of the collaborative project? If one student is failing to learn and needs constructive criticism, how will the teacher identify that student and provide the feedback the pupil needs, even desires? He will be lost in the anonymity of a collaborative project. I'm not sure all students share your ethical concern for being responsible to their peers. Even if the majority share that sense of responsibility, it only takes one bad apple who fails to contribute to a project to lessen its quality, and thus ruin or diminish the learning experience of all the other students who were relying upon him or her for a share of the work. I've never had a student suggest for himself or herself an average or below-average grade, even when the work was substandard by my judgment.<query> why is it important to assess learning</query> When students evaluate other students on the project, nine times out of ten, they agree that so-and-so did a marvelous or a horrible job. But about one time out of ten, I would receive conflicting evaluations: one student would write ""so-and-so really helped the group with x,"" but another student would write, ""so-and-so missed all our group meetings and didn't contribute anything until the night before the project was due."" Is it appropriate to trust the first student? The second student? To split the difference and mark the grade as ""C""? I would fear that (in my own case) the desire to let students assess themselves and each other in an anonymous, collaborative project would be casting aside my responsibilities as a teacher by foisting them on unsuspecting freshman.<query> why do students write conflicting evaluations</query> You said something at the beginning of that last bit there that struck me, Kip: that a ""bad apple"" not contributing as much to the group somehow diminishes the learning experience for the rest of the group. How? Seems to me that such an experience enhances the learning value. It may lessen the final product, but it's theprocess that's important in group activities anyway-- at least for me. And that seems to get to the heart of the issue in general. A process-oriented pedagogy stresses the road, not the destination. It emphasizes the importance of learning techniques, not figuring out ways to please an authority figure to get a good grade. And since the best thing we can teach our students is how to learn and critique themselves, I find it important to encourage my students to evaluate themselves based on standards that we determine as a group. But, (I see your brow furrowing, Kip) I realize that often we are bound to assign grades authoritatively to our students, as is the case for Composition Instructors at the U of O, when they can't seem to do it responsibly themselves, but I would argue that those cases are rare .<query> why is process oriented pedagogy important</query> When I have assigned collaborative projects-- with which I've had a great deal of success, I would add-- I make my students turn in a written evaluation of both their own contributions to the projects, and of the contributions of each other member. That keeps it fair I would like to know what your secret is, Darren. The few times I've tried collaborative projects, I've also had students turn in written evaluations of their own work and that of their partners. (I must admit I've only tried the process two or three times, then gave it up in disgust; if you've been doing it for awhile, you may have developed some helpful tricks to make it work). As teachers, I know we feel a certain responsibility to make sure that students receive as accurate an evaluation of their work as possible-- Speak for yourself Adam!<query> what is the purpose of a collaborative project</query> You're so top-heavy I feel like I'm leaning! I know that grading carries with it a certain ideological bias. To a degree, it is subjective in nature, I will grant you. I'm not sure that doing away with evaluating the individual and instead evaluating a collective group of students solves that problem. In my past experience, collaborative projects have always been nightmares, both for my students and for me as a grader. It's another form of anonymity because I am often unable to assess fairly who contributed what in the larger project. If an online project includes an extraordinary annotated bibliography, which student did that part? Or did each student contribute one or two articles? Who is responsible for that outstanding collection of slides during the class presentation? That person deserves special commendation. However, what about the student that failed to turn in his share of the work, or the one that ignored his section of the assignment, forcing Susie to do two parts?<query> why is it important to evaluate the individual in a project</query> So much of the work in collaborative assignments takes place out of class, and I cannot observe all that goes into its construction. In our 608 readings, we have an essay written collaboratively by multiple authors under a single pen-name Myka Vielstimmig. In the concluding footnotes, it was clear that the writing group responsible often shifted in its membership from one publication to the next. To me, that creates disturbing possibilities. Suppose the early members of such a collaborative project publish fantastic materials. Later, the group's composition changes. Imagine someone under the group's pen-name then publishes a work with grotesque errors in citation, or makes a claim that turns out to be patently false, and becomes the laughingstock of the academic discourse community. Will that stigma attach itself (unfairly) to those earlier members who published under the same pen-name, but had no part in the later projects?<query> what is the purpose of a collaborative writing group</query> Having your name attached to something keeps you honest. Maybe it's just Foucauldian influences at work, but if our intellectual work can be linked back to us, it may keep us honest, and give us a stake in producing the best intellectual work possible. From these comments, it sounds like you place a great deal of importance on intellectual property. Is that true? Yes. And Darren thinks it would be useful to break that paradigm? Well, yes, actually I do, but I'm not wholly committed to the issue. As a writer and poet myself, I have a sort of egoistic desire to be congratulated for mywork, to be rewarded for my ideas, as it were. But that's really not where I see the issue that Kip just mentioned: that is, the issue of assessing a collaborative project.<query> why is intellectual property important</query> I think he makes a good point about the members of the group known collectively as Myka Vielstimmig--that a sloppy member could discredit the name of the whole group, but again, I would stress the importance of the discourse community and the natural checks that members of a community hold each other to. As for assessing a group.... What do you make of the recent court injunction against napster , in which anonymous individuals can go online and download materials protected under copyright? I myself am in favor of something like the potential of Napster. Here, we have various forms of art readily available to the public in a way never possible before. Horse piddle, I say. You must have hippie leanings also, in spite of your minimal coiffure. Mr. Mustcrotchette-- That's Professor Mustcrotchette! Does nobody in this room have a sense of copyright history ?<query> what is napster</query> Shortly before the French Revolution in the late eighteenth-century, the French abolished copyright laws, if you will recall. Their ideals were the same as those discussed here--eliminating the idea of individual intellectual ownership so that the greater community could freely share these materials. It was disastrous! Artists, writers, and musicians often had to drastically cut back their production of literature and art, because it was no longer feasible for them to support themselves through the sale of such items. Imagine Voltaire, if you will, being forced literally to tend his garden in order to avoid starvation! Bootlegged copies of printed materials flooded the market. And fifteen years later, the Republic voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the copyright laws after the disastrous experiment. Those fools like you who lament the loss of Napster and bemoaning the fact the law won't let you commit acts of intellectual piracy at your whim.<query> why did the copyright laws become illegal</query> Taking another work and reproducing it without credit is theft, plain and simple. --Professor Mustcrotchette, I don't think the two are comparable. Copyright laws specifically are designed to prevent individuals from selling and making financial profit by reproducing another's work without permission. Yes, Napster might potentially hurt the profits of big record-companies. But it isn't stealing from them. The people using the Napster website before the court injunction weren't taking their copies and selling them on the street for a profit, they were giving them away freely to whoever wanted a copy. Yes, that might have deleterious effects on music sales, but I'm sure giving away free food would also have deleterious effects on restaurants, and that doesn't mean the act should be outlawed. Boy that's a great example of an upstanding model to emulate there, Robespierre, the French Revolutionaries!<query> why is napster stealing</query> How exactly would you describe your concerns? [Kip]: It's primarily an issue that has arisen between Darren and myself. We both want our students to excel at writing in an on-line environment, and in many classes teachers have their students use ""handles"" or alternate identities in on-line discussions. As an undergraduate myself, I was a student in such a classroom at West Texas State University, using the handle ""Matilda the Hun."" The idea is that students who would otherwise be too shy to speak in class would feel more comfortable expressing their honest opinions in a real debate if their identity remains concealed. In my experience, both as a student and a teacher, it does seem to have that effect in the short-term, and I understand the value that might bring. Sometimes by wearing masks, we create a space where we feel more free to express ourselves.<query> why do students wear masks</query> Ha! We all know how dedicated they were to justice and individual rights. If Napster were selling the materials on its website without the permission of the artist or owner, I would agree that the act was piracy. But there is no law against sharing. It's sort of like one person buying a big television set, a DVD player, andJurassic Park, then inviting eighty or so thousand friends to come over and watch it with him. As long he's not charging them any money, he isn't violating copyright in any way I can see. In the same way, Napster is like an individual purchasing a music CD, burning five-thousand copies, and then giving them away at the corner of the block to whoever wants a copy. There's no law against giving gifts freely, at your own expense.<query> is napster a copyright</query> The original donors to Napster all had to legally purchase their first copy before they could alter it to MP3 format. Only then was it possible to place it on the net for others to share. I think its important that the original artist's name be attached to such duplicated files, so individuals do not try to take an Alanis Morisette CD, replace her name with another, and change the title. Shouldn't we return to classroom discussion? To students? But this event does relate directly to students. Academic equivalents to this newfangled Napster contraption will appear, copies of scholarly works on-line, student essays on-line. 'Ere now, we already 'ave that, don't we now? It's called the internet, and your students will be a usin' it, and are a usin' it, mark me words, lads.<query> why is napster important</query> The intelligent thing would be to steer students away from the internet, too, before the ease of accessing materials anonymously and then stamping a name falsely on the first page contributes to the increasingly philistine nature of modern culture. These problems would be greatly lessened if we stuck with time-proven, approved means of publications like books and print. No, we shouldn't try to discourage such new technology. We should instead teach our students to make use of it responsibly. If we don't do that, there are two possible outcomes I can see on a wider social level when it comes to copyright protection. Those government agencies in charge of enforcing copyright laws will undertake a sort of prohibition-style approach. Their attempts will ultimately prove either infeasible or feasible, and either way, the result will be negative.<query> why do we discourage copyright protection</query> Suppose it turns out to be infeasible to completely stop Napster-like groups on-line, but only to nab an occasional offender. What would the result look like? Thefederales run a few stings to nab the Napsters, but each time they knock down a website of that sort, a Gnutella or Nutunes will pop up to take its place. We'll end up with sporadically enforced crackdowns that will result in occasional arrests, but not prevent the trend. Recording and publishing industries will sue whoever they think they can get money from, and the equivalent of virtual speak-easies will pop up on the net where people using aliases will swap the material as they will. If the music/writing/art swapping movement is forced underground, the odds increase that these sites, forced to swap files at some risk to themselves, will begin to charge users to download such stuff.<query> what is the result of napsters</query> The price would be less than what record-companies are charging now, of course, but I suspect the flowering of illegal copies will supersede the sharing model. The days of free-exchange, of sharing files, may be over. If users can't legally share your music files on-line in an open manner, we create a profitable niche for music bootleggers to secretly undercut prices. I think human generosity will end at the point people run the risk of fines or prison. The second possibility is even worse, I think. There may be a way to effectively and completely monitor the web for illegal copies that requires very little manpower. That is digital watermarking, a practice some museums and graphic designers are already experimenting with in their online materials. Copyright holders might mark all their files with code that functions like a combination of metatags and cookies.<query> why is it illegal to share music files</query> Every month or two, they send out the equivalent of a spider or a 'bot to search the web for copies of that file--perhaps an image of Mickey Mouse, perhaps the Nike swoosh, or an MP3 File of AC/DC's latest song, or a Stephen King novel. Each image or file contains within its coding a hidden virtual watermark. The spider or 'bot then check to see if the copy was legally obtained. If not, the program notes the computer and its unique numeric address. Checking that against registration, the legal copyright owners might then be able to send a bill to that computer's owner, or call the police, or whatnot. That's too Orwellian for my taste, too 1984-ish. But the potential is there. It is being developed. The only way to prevent commercial interests from researching and creating such products is for the internet community to police itself.<query> what is the purpose of a copyright spider</query> Those writers, artists, scholars, who put a lot of work into a project--in some cases years or even decades--deserve recognition (and yes, maybe even payment) for that work. If we don't instill in our students a strong sense of intellectual property, and a sense of ethics concerning such matters, they will probably continue the cycle of copyright breach. In turn, that will encourage writers, artists, and publishers to use such Draconian, Orewellian measures to monitor computer-users. Exactly the stance I would expect from a white male doctoral candidate (you can hide behind your green font all you want, but I can see your real color!) Intellectual property rights are there to protect the elitephysical property holders, and no one else. Vandana Shiva once told me a story of a graduate student in Chemistry who worked for years with a professor to develop a technique for genetically coding a seed so that it wouldn't reproduce.<query> why is intellectual property important</query> A procedure invented, by the way, so that farmers would have to buy the seeds every year and become increasingly reliant upon the company that ""owns"" the seed. Anyway, if the seed itself were not sinister enough, the professor insisted on being the primary name under which they published their work-- for better credibility, he claimed. Then, when the graduate student-- who had collaborated on inventing the procedure, mind you-- tried to use the procedure for his own individual work, the professor had him arrested for copyright infringement. There's your recognition, for you. Such laws protect the rich and the privileged; they do not ensure recognition for work. AskNicola Tesla about that one. I really would like to turn this discussion back to the classroom. What dangers or benefits do you see in the adoption of multiple or imaginary personas?<query> why was the seed procedure invented</query> One tendency is that the discussion might tend to wander. Each persona ""wants"" to say something, and that something may or may not be on the topic at hand. I see. There is a cure for that though. Bart Beaudin, a Professor of Adult Education at Colorado State University, has proposed a list oftechniques to prevent the discussion from wandering. It's not an insurmountable problem. Again, there's also that hurly-burly about a virtual rape inLambdaMOO a few years back. One danger is that personas will get out of control, engage in antisocial or disruptive activities within an electronic environment. Richard MacKinnon at the University of Texas at Austin ""witnessed"" the verbal assault. He noted in his article on the event that ""a persona lacks accountability for its actions"" when ""utility to the user or a 'stake' is absent"" (""Virtually Unaccountable"").<query> what is the danger of personas</query> Even here at this university, two years ago on an e-mail list, we had such an incident that even made the pages ofThe Emerald. In that case, it wasn't even a matter of being completely anonymous so much as being in a faceless environment that encouraged a student to make remarks that would never have been tolerated inmy classroom. I haven't noticed that sort of disruption so much in the classes I have taught myself, but I did notice that as an undergraduate student at another university. In a course on creative writing, the teacher had us post short stories on the Daedalus Exchange, and then in real-time swap feedback with each other. Both the author and the evaluators used pseudonyms. At least one individual used this virtual space as an arena for obnoxious and disruptive behavior. He (or maybeshe, but I suspect a he) went by the handle ""Connie Lingus"" in some sessions, or ""Phil Lasheo"" in others.<query> what is the name of the anonymous person who used a virtual space to discuss a story [Mustcrochette]: Like Prince Hal and his cloak in Henry V, I assume? As I understand Darren's position, Darren thinks-- (mutters) That long-haired neo-hippy. I'm sorry, what was that? (coughs) Just clearing my throat. Do go on. Precisely. My worry is that, rather than encouraging students to speak for themselves, in the long run we may create the opposite effect. Students may become so used to expressing themselves behind a protective, electronic disguise, that they ultimately feel even more uncomfortable when it comes time to taking a public stand on issues they feel strongly about by joining group debate, or publishing writing, or participating in other forms of discourse. We need to instill in them a habit of attaching their own names to their own thinking.<query> who is darren in henry v</query> The teacher deliberately set up the system preferences in the beginning of the term so that not even the instructor would ever know who was using which nickname. (The only comment the instructor made to the disruptive student was, ""Phil, your nickname sucks."") The teacher's philosophy was that the students would police themselves. To a certain extent, we did. We cajoled and insulted Connie/Phil mercilessly whenever he stepped out of line, until eventually the user stopped using those two monikers and appeared with a different handle on the Daedalus Exchange. I wonder, however, if you actually did gain something productive from that experience. The class as a whole learned how to shut down a disruptive influence by their collective will, independently from an official authority figure's intervention. Surely that sort of lesson is worthwhile in and of itself? Perhaps so.<query> what is the meaning of the nickname phil</query> I hadn't really thought of it that way. However, it took about half the semester for this to occur, and recidivism exploded in the last week of class. We all felt it was really the teacher's job to step in and shut down that sort of disruption, not our job. Over the course of the semester, we must have wasted hours in dealing with Connie/Phil. This is an example of why I think its important for the facilitator to play an active part in these virtual discussion groups. If it had been me running the MOO, I would probably have tried to determine earlier if Phil's participation was offensive to the group, and then intervened if that were the case. Exactly the same as if it were any listserv dialogue. Besides, I think another important element to Freshman Writing courses is encouraging students to find authority in arguments and reasoning, not in some meaningless hierarchy of age or privilege conferred by the Institution. Something I think few graduate student/teachers really consider. Rubbish.<query> why is it important to have a facilitator in a discussion group</query> Absolute rubbish. It would have been much faster if the teacher could identify which student was being disruptive and stopped him during the first session. We have authority figures for a reason. Sometimes it is more ethical to silence one student's voice so that others may speak. I'm certain that members of this younger generation of teachers are all too lily-livered to admit the unpleasant fact, but truth is truth. Teachers have the responsibility to give students a timely and efficient education. In this example, out of misplaced desire to decentralize the classroom, the teacher ended up wasting several hours of how many students' time? Twenty? Thirty? All to avoid stepping on one miscreant's ego? All to give this philistine the freedom to be insulting and disruptive? Authority simply won't work unless everyone knows who the authority-figure is.<query> why do teachers have authority figures</query> Who is the authority-figure in a virtual environment, then? (If we need such a thing.) Out of all the speakers here, I think my rank and distinguished publications speak for themselves, as well as my honors from Wittenberg University. The authority-figure certainly isn't you, Mr. Wheeler. Or Mr. Reiley for that matter. The way you are dithering here assures me of that, quite clearly. But in a virtual environment, I don't think it's that clear. For instance, perhaps Darren has logged on as ""Kip"" and is using my name. Or maybe I am using his. Or maybe we are alternating every other message between names. There is no necessary correlation between the name that appears in the discussion list and the writer. In a virtual environment, identities can be always appropriated by others.<query> who is the authority figure in a virtual environment</query> I could log-on with the handle of ""Anne Laskaya,"" head of the Composition Program, or as John Gage, head of the English Department. It might instill a reticence in the other writers on the discussion list to see a pronouncement from some writer labeled ""jgage."" In effect, it would be too easy to steal auctoritas from another scholar, or set up straw-men to be knocked down. [jgage]: He's absolutely right, but it is still an unethical misappropriation of identity. And the students involved in an on-line debate might choose to play it safe, on the off-chance that the person pretending to be me really is me. How can we form a discourse community, or trace a logical argument to a conclusion unless we have a clear sense of who is in that discourse community? Yes, How do rhetoricians adapt for an audience when we are uncertain to whom speak?<query> who is jgage</query> How do we arrive at shared assumptions with individuals who don't really exist? How do we produce a real debate when individuals can shift personas, pretend they hold view they don't, or refuse to take responsibility for something a persona says? But aren't you doing so now? Aren't we producing a debate, even if the audience, and the other writers aren't sure who is really writing what? I've also noted that we have far more speakers here than we have writers, at least according to my roll-sheet. Some of the people speaking here must have adapted personas. That concerns me too Look here, Hosty, don't try to play like you're not a fictional character, we all know thegreenguy is controlling what you say. But we all know that Derrida has shown exhaustively that all identities are socially constructed fictions anyway, so let's address the real issue ofstudents adapting to an audience.<query> who is adapting personas</query> It's not the upper echelons of the rhetorical elite we're here to discuss, now is it? 'Ere now. Mebee credit's not the point at all, 'ere. Mebee a valid argument's a good argument no matter whare it 'riginally popped out, what? Why does anybody need credit for it at all, now? That's argumentum ad 'ominem, it is. My dear sir, you must be a half-wit. Go and mate with the village idiot, and perhaps your children can achieve full status as complete morons. What would be the point in creating such fictions? If a fictional character makes a subtle or powerful argument, and everyone loves it, how will the real author ever get credit for it? When the publication is complete, who obtains the recognition, the line on the c.v., so to speak?<query> why does anybody need credit for mebee</query> But remember Rob Howard's discussion of the Storm Front website. Recall the exercise in which he showed his class an argumentative essay from this Neo-Nazi website without revealing the source? The essay argued in favor of the formation of white student groups in high schools. The students in Rob's class all agreed with the argument, and then were horrified when Rob showed them the source. Here's a case where the origin of an idea is important, both for understanding an underlying ideological purpose in proposing the argument, and for recognizing the potential for rhetorical damage if a writer were to treat this material with the same amount of credibility we might give a different source. Suppose a student were to repeat that argument while being ignorant of the source. However, some members of his reading audience recognizes its origin. The audience might then equate the student with the Storm Front racial supremacist movement.<query> why is the origin of an idea important</query> It's not safe to disregard the source of an idea. That's an important point for students to understand, so they can avoid being manipulated by sources with commercial or political biases. True, but that student would also be held accountable for those ideas by his or her discourse community after the fact, and the repercussions for recapitulating Storm Front's arguments would very likely teach him or her to look more carefully next time. And that's exactly the point! This entire discussion has been based (I think) on an assumption that the writing class, or the collaborative or anonymous experiment, is a self-contained entity. And we’ve been trying to ferret out all of the political and ideological ramifications within that entity itself--which is important I grant you. But a writing class goes far beyond the ten weeks in which it exists in time, and the most important element to such a class is not the final grade or even the concrete product students turn in at the end, but the rhetorical and critical skill they carry away with them.<query> why is it important to write a class</query> In the case of the Stormfront essay, Rob’s students learned an invaluable lesson: NOT that intellectual property is important to hold the author responsible, or even that we have to know precisely the origin of an argument (although I would never say that's not important). The lesson is that we must learn to examine the rhetoric of a piece closely, in order to explore all of the implications of an argument in terms of what is being implied and the assumptions upon which it rests. We won’t always be certain of the origin of an argument, or even who crafted it--that is the reality of the internet. But that doesn't mean we should outlaw it, or shrink from creating anonymous for a in which students have to deal with these ramifications. On the contrary, the gradual disappearance of the author is not simply an ideological stance that I’m espousing--it is an inevitable result of the internet-- --and of the increasing power of a Police State-- ...and it is therefore imperative that we teach our students to look at a text with these critical skills intact.<query> why is it important to know the origin of an argument</query> The best way to ensure that people are responsible and honest in their research and publication is to ensure that the writing is linked to a specific name, on whom readers and listeners can appropriately heap credit or blame. That may seem a bit Foucauldian, but it's valuable. [Jeerer in the crowd]: 'E called him a right long-'aired 'ippy, 'e did. I 'eard it with me own two ears. My dear sir, you must be mistaken. Do go on, Mr. Wheeler. And if you've got something to say, Il Duce, either say it to the group or keep it zipped! I'm sorry, I've lost my train of thought with these disruptive personas. Maybe I should let Darren speak for himself here. Darren? [Darren]: I've got two points to make here Kip, the first of which concerns this issue of students, or writers in general, being held responsible for their work.<query> who is responsible for writing</query> [HECKLER] But, Joor just dodgink the issue again, YesNo? Le students need to see le Ouebsite to understand the racisme, eh? Exactly. In a truly anonymous on-line environment, in which the argument or final-product appears unattached to any organization or name, the students in Rob's class would never be able to make the connection Rob revealed by placing the argument back in authorial context. Without seeing Storm-Front website, the reader would never know she was perpetuating and supporting the arguments of a Neo-Nazi group. The only reason the students would learn the lesson about knowing the source you quote is because Rob took the time to pull away the veil of anonymity and show them the organization responsible behind the essay. The students may be a bit more suspicious about quoting a source without analyzing it first, (which is definitely a good thing), but thereason they are now more suspicious is they have learned the link between argument and author.<query> why do students need to see storm front</query> Bah, joor just all agreeing with each other now. Pooey! What about the possibilities of play? It strikes me that creating anonymity via personas has a particular appeal in the imaginative aspect of writing. It creates a space for role-playing even as its members enjoin in intellectual debate. (snorts) Like children? We seek to produce intellectually mature adults here, not pander to the adolescent impulse. I found the Vielstimmig essay to be loads of fun, and I imagine the authors enjoyed crafting it, and yet, they are all mature adults, and what's more, they used the playfulness to achieve a particularly rhetorical, pseudo-hypertextual, effect. Rubbish! Horse Hockey! You're skating on thin ice with me, there, CrustMotchette! For me, the aspect of play is the one advantage of anonymity that gives me no moral qualms.<query> what is the playfulness of vielstimmig essay</query> As a contributor to this collaborative on-line project, it has been tremendous fun to explore an argument by taking on various personas. I'd consider anonymity in the early stages of an on-line, classroom discussion. Maybe during the first day of debate. But after students have had their fun and games, and tried out various writing styles and authorial voices, I would want the debate eventually to move back into discourse where everyone knows who is speaking. The only disturbing part is that the personas do take on a life of their own, after a while. I feel the same way. Wait a minute--you are the persona, aren't you? And I'm the author? Poppycock. I'm as real as you are. Only Ms. Hassensprenger is an artificial construct, as is easily discernible by her ridiculous name.<query> who is the author of the poem</query> I created her as a composite of the Indian Death Goddess (Kali) and-- Nobody can say I didn't warn him. Disparage the Goddess at your own peril, Musketcrotch, your days of flaccid patriarchal privilege are over! [Grips the podium and shatters it over Mustcrotchette's back] Note how the Kestrel always shrieks just before it dives for the kill.... You want a piece of me too Frenchie LaRouche? I'll be there as soon as I'm done with Crusty! [Takes Mustcrotchette in a headlock] I say! Stop that! Who's responsible for making them stop? I... I'm not sure. [sound of sirens and jackboots on pavement] [voice via bullhorn]: ""This riot will desist immediately. This is the Reality Police, Verisimilitude Squad. You are under arrest for disorderly conduct in an academic environment."" Show some id first.<query> who is responsible for making them stop</query> Who are you? ""Lieutenant Tiller. Verisimilitude Squad. You're under arrest also, Hessensprenger, for assaulting an eminent scholar. Come quietly or there will be . . . trouble."" [blubbering]: Officer, it wasn't my fault at all. It was her! She's a madwoman. She doesn't even wear makeup! She-- Tell it to the judge, Mr. Fancy-Tweed-Suit-With-Arm-Patches. [sweetly] He prefers Doctor Fancy-Tweed-Suit, actually. I'm sure all of the students who had to drop out of school because of your elitist standards will enjoy seeing you in the joint, you pompous...[BEEP!] And so concludes our virtual conference. I wish there were time to field questions from the audience, but I'd be afraid who would appear even if we did.<query> who is lieutenant tiller</query> Please join us here next month when Doctors Brazen Brackenblood and Stacey Synecdoche will take on poet/activist Briathar Kinesi in a real-time animated presentation entitled ""Sufferin' Semaphore: The Net, The Blob, and the Emptied Signifier"" Thank you...

Click here for credits, thanks, and additional copyright information.<query> who is kip wheeler</query> The second deals with the notion of assessment--and perhaps Dr. Hassesnsprenger would like to respond to that herself--but since Kip and I first crossed foils with the former issue, I'll start there. Partially I agree with you, Kip, at least about the danger of students becoming reliant on electronic masks, as you put it, and then becoming increasingly reluctant to speak out in person. Because of this danger, I would never rely solely on such an approach. Using anonymous or pseudonymous standpoints from which to voice opinions is a tool for empowering students to speak when they might not otherwise, for allowing students the opportunity to try out some of their more fringe ideas without fearing the feeling like they’ll be pounced on for them. This is a case in which I think it can be productive to remove the accountability. If students have a persona through which they can try out problematic positions, the discourse community (of which the facilitator is an important part) will then offer its responses to that idea and hopefully point out the problems with it. The student will then have been able to see the problems with the argument, without feeling shamed to have said something “stupid.” Without that shield, many student think these problematic positions but never voice them out of fear, and therefore never have the opportunity to work them out. [Hassensprenger]: I would take that one step further, and challenge this neo-Fascist and extremely phallo-centric ideology that wants to own everything, and that has resulted in a brand of identity politics that insists on identifying Self by distinguishing from Other.<query> why use pseudonymous viewpoints</query> This is the basis of a patriarchal system that we're talking about here-- a system that feels that it must maintain an established hierarchy of Grader and Graded, and that is predicated on a Capitalist and elitist need to reward the ""good workers"" [making derisive quotes in the air with her fingers] rather than encouraging people to feel an intrinsic investment in the work they produce. [Host]: Well then, what about student collaborative projects? I believe Darren has expressed some interest in such projects? [Darren]: I truly believe that this whole insistence on tying an idea to a particular individual is not only conceptually problematic, in a Foucauldian sense, but completely neglects the natural checks that members of a community place upon each other. If students work collaboratively, they will, if properly encouraged, parcel out duties, hold each other to the work and hopefully maintain a dialogue that in effect keeps each individual member responsible for what he or she contributes.<query> what is collaborative work</query> If one person is slacking, then the group has the option of expelling that member from the group. In fact, I would contend that collaborative work actually encourages a greater sense of responsibility rather than a lesser: I know for myself that I work harder when a group is depending upon me than if it is only myself that will be called to task. It is true that I may not be giving sufficient credit to the discourse community's ability to check individual members. Richard MacKinnon, who wrote about an act ofvirtual rape on LambdaMOO, noted that the group collectively came up with a virtual punishment for a deviant member, but questioned whether such self-policing is sufficient or ""mattered"" when only a persona is punished, not the person responsible. I think Susan Romano's article dealt particularly well with this issue also. She maintained that giving students the opportunity to challenge their notions of identity can provide a very liberating experience for students and instructors alike.<query> who wrote about virtual rape on lambdamoo</query> But she also emphasizes the need for what she calls ""rhetorical authority"" which amounts to the kind of monitoring that Kip and I both appear to favor. Though her critique is more focused on the ways in which women's voices become overpowered and suppressed by male privilege even in such pseudonymous virtual settings, I think her argument fits into this context as well. But Kip, you were referring to issues of student self-assessment, right? You're too damn soft Reiley! This fascist is only barely veiling his misogyny. The whole basis for a grading system goes right back to Adam being granted the privilege of naming everything in the world. It is a topdown system of ordering that is held in place to separate drones from soldiers, and workers from worked-for. It is obvious that the Academy's sad dependence on ""evaluating"" students [derisive finger-quotes] is nothing more than a vestige of this androcentric and Christyrannical mythos, and one that has become far more harmful than productive.<query> why is the grading system so bad</query> Its most apparent result is that students are only interested in receiving good grades rather than feeling inherently driven to create good work. They're only secondarily interested in learning new skills or discovering the true process of inquiry; their primary concern is figuring out how to do as little as possible to get a B or-- even more rare-- an A. So I ask you WHY?! Why this insistence on evaluating everything. Why can't the students hold themselves responsible for what they produce, and why can't the teacher's job be to facilitate, not to assess? This is the part of Kali's book that I agree with the most. In my experience, students have developed this Outside-In mentality towards their work. Removing the emphasis on individual performance and extrinsic rewards of that performance can only encourage students to seek a more lasting, intrinsic meaning to their work. But Miss Hassensprenger, why create an artificial division between facilitating learning and assessing it?<query> why is it important to facilitate learning</query>"

It is a 1950s German-made ProbatUG22, made back when cast iron was of higher quality. It was retrofitted for Transcend by Giesen in the Netherlands, and is now a shiny, impressive, colourful machine. Once the beans are in the machine they get tossed around and roasted. Kate carefully monitors the temperature to make sure the beans are roasted absolutely perfectly. She routinely pulls a sample from the roaster and checks the progress. She smells the beans, and checks the colour to make sure everything is on track. Once the roasting is complete the beans are released from the roaster, and given some time to cool down. Kate looks through the beans for any defects. I asked her if she felt proud when a great batch came out of the roaster, and, with a little smile, she said “Yes”.<query> what is the name of the machine that roasts beans</query> We watched her roast two full batches, and it’s a complicated, and detailed process. She takes notes every few minutes, in case she needs to go back and adjust her technique. She’s extremely dedicated to getting the perfect roast. But the process doesn’t stop there. Every morning, Kate and the team at the roastery also test the beans from the previous day, in a process called cupping. First, she grinds beans from all the roasts she did the day before. Two essential elements of the cupping process are the detailed notes she makes of everything she tastes, as well as the very cool cupping bowls! We got to drink some coffee out of one, and felt like real coffee connoisseurs. :) The first step of the cupping process is smelling the dry ground beans. Poul, the founder of Transcend, joined in the cupping. After the dry smelling, they carefully poured hot water into the grounds.<query> what is the cupping process</query> This part of the process is tricky, because you need to control all the variables—like the temperature of the water, and the time each cup brews. Then comes smelling the brewed coffee. The step in this next photo is called “breaking the crust”. The coffee grounds create a crust on top, and with your spoon you break it, and smell the aromatics that come out. Then, the final step, is the actual tasting of the coffee. A special cupping spoon is used, and the coffee is literally slurped! If you watch the Moving Portrait you’ll be able to hear—it’s a loud process! Basically, when you quickly slurp the coffee it coats all of your tongue, so you can taste all the elements of the flavour. The inhaling also lets you get the full effect of the aromatic elements (a lot like tasting wine!).<query> what is the process of slurping coffee</query> Once the coffees have been tested, and the quality is awesome, they get packaged up. Then those little bags hit the road, and head over to the Transcend cafes! The Garneau location is amazing. Relaxed, modern, and comfy… …with some seriously talented baristas. They go through a LOT of training (a minimum of 40 hours!!) before they’re ready to start pulling shots. And believe me, getting a great shot of espresso is a complicated matter! First a very precise amount of beans are ground immediately before the shot. Then it is “tamped” (pushed down and smoothed out) with a specific amount of pressure (30 pounds, to be exact). The grounds then go in the super snazzy machine… And that amazing, creamy, golden shot of espresso is created. Milk is expertly steamed to get just the right micro-foam on top… Which lets you create some amazing latte art!<query> how to make a perfect shot of espresso</query> And here you have it. All that work, all that careful roasting, testing, and preparation—for this one amazing cup of coffee. As I hope you can see, there are a whole lot of people involved who are dedicated to making the best coffee possible. When you drink a Transcend cup, you suddenly realize just what coffee can be. It’s complex and nuanced, just like a glass of wine. What’s fascinating about Transcend is that they care about more than just producing a fantastic cup of coffee. They care very deeply about the people that grow their beans. The fair trade issue is very big in the coffee world. There are a lot of workers who get paid very little, labour 7 days a week, and don’t even make enough to send their kids to school. Poul and his team are dedicated to “finding that farmer that fits our model of quality, and then celebrating the amount of work that they do and recognizing them for it”.<query> what is the coffee company called that makes the best coffee</query> They pay fair prices that allow the farmers to escape poverty, and take care of their families. There’s a whole lot more that goes into coffee, isn’t there? The team at Transcend put a ton of effort into every last detail, living up to their tagline—to raise coffee to a new level. I want to share what James at Transcend said about the work we created for them: One of the keys to the Transcend Coffee marketing strategy is authenticity. Being real, open and honest, and making genuine connections with individuals. When we were just one café/roastery, it was easy for our customers to look through the giant plate glass window that separated the roastery and the café and see all the action – roasting, cupping, discussions, training, etc. Now that we have three cafés and a separate roasting facility and cupping lab, we wanted to find a way to achieve that same openness and transparency.<query> what is the tagline of transcend coffee</query> We wanted to bring the big plate glass window back. Working with Rob& Lauren on behind the scenes portraits and the fantastic moving portrait, did all that and more. Rob & Lauren were fun, professional, relaxed, engaging, and well, just delightful human beings. And the results were way beyond our expectations. We’ll use the photos and moving portrait across all of our marketing channels: web, social media, in-store marketing and more to show the breadth and depth of our dedication to great coffee. Thanks Rob& Lauren! To us, that’s the point of a portrait. To show the authentic, and to help create connection. Hopefully after seeing all this, you understand Transcend a bit more! If you’d like to visit their cafes (which we highly recommend you do) check them out at: Garneau Location: 8708 - 109 Street, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Jasper Ave Location: 10349 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Argyll Location: 9869 - 62 Ave, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada If you’re not in Edmonton, don’t worry!<query> where is garneau cafe</query> You can still get your hands on their amazing coffee!

Families, newborns, couples, and individual folks—we adore it all. * **Take a moment, and check out the details on how we can create happy portraits of the people you love* ** *Scroll past this post to see all the new awesomeness! * Email this post Link to this post From the past // Santorini Posted by rnl on June 16, 2011 Lauren and I got married in Greece nearly two years ago! I can’t believe how time flies. I think going through photos you’ve forgotten you even took is just about as magical as taking the photos themselves. This is a photo of a black sand beach on Santorini, an island in the Greek Cyclades.<query> where is lauren and rob from</query> Not early enough. Question: What is the difference between a moving portrait and a video?? Lauren – Jun. 15, 2011 at 10:30 a.m. Hey Melanie! Thank you for such a wonderful comment! It was truly our pleasure :) Lauren – Jun. 15, 2011 at 10:34 a.m. Hi Ashley! We agree, it's hard to believe so much flavour can come from something as seemingly simple as coffee! And thanks for the question! A Moving Portrait is what we call our videos that are focused on capturing essenceâ€”whether of a person, couple, family, or business. Like a portrait, but adding in the element of motion! Shauna – Jun. 15, 2011 at 8:26 p.m. Very cool post. It looks like you really captured the essence of the company.<query> what is the difference between a moving portrait and a video</query> You would really love New Zealand! Between the coffee (have you heard of a flat white??) to the wine (ohmygoodness amazing!) you would have a blast. Not to mention the incredible scenery. Lauren – Jun. 17, 2011 at 10:21 a.m. Thanks so much Shauna!! I'm quite certain I would love New Zealand :) Coffee, wine and scenery sounds like perfection! And I hadn't heard of a flat white before, but they serve them at Transcend!! Of course :) Lindsay – Jul. 13, 2011 at 2:07 p.m. Great video! It's crazy how much work goes into coffee before it even hits the store. The only thing I can suggest is using a tripod for the video - That would take it right over the top!<query> what kind of wine do they serve in new zealand</query> Luis – Jul. 27, 2011 at 12:21 p.m. Great work here! And incredibly happy to see the name of my country in the first picture. We're all proud of the coffee beans this land produces! In love with your job! Steph of FoodHappy // Portraits of a Food Blogger Posted by rnl on May 31, 2011 Steph is an awesome food blogger. Her site, FoodHappy, is all about making incredible food fun and easy. She’s just getting going, but already has inspired many (Rob and myself included) to start making our own bread, ice cream, and more. Steph is also my younger sister, and I’m seriously proud of how much effort she puts into helping others learn more about food. I’ve learned tons and tons from her over the years, and am so stoked that she’s now sharing it with the world onFoodHappy.<query> who is steph of food happy</query> We wanted to make sure she had some great portraits of herself, as well as a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at all the work she puts into her blog. Starting off at the local farmer’s market, she picked some awesome looking tomatoes, then brought them home to make a calabrese salad. Even though it’s a very simple dish, it took her a long time to create because of how many photos she takes of everything!! There is a serious amount of work that goes into each and every post, and if youcheck out her work, it shows. Hope you enjoyed these shots, and if you are into food, you definitely need to check outFoodHappy.

Love it :) Dayna, Mel, Kerry + Sierra // Puppy Love Posted by rnl on May 26, 2011 I know you’re totally riveted, and anxious to hear the rest of the story ofThe History of the Portrait. I’m working on the sequel! So for now, with this super chilly rainy week, I thought I’d share some sunny happy portraits we took last fall of Dayna, her sister Mel, Mel’s boyfriend Kerry, and their mega adorable puppy Sierra. These photos were for a surprise gift for Dayna and Mel’s parents, so I had to hold off posting them until the canvas was delivered! (I hear there were tears, so I think the gift was well apprecaited :) Now we can all have a bit more happy in our day with some puppy love. I’m sure it goes without saying, but we had such a fantastic evening with these awesome folks.<query> who is dayna mel's boyfriend</query> The sun was shining, the puppies were out and about, and it was an excellent way to relax, and just hang out together. We met up at the extremely cool Terwillegar Dog Park, and played. Sierra is a very very loved pup. Even in the freezing cold of winter, these three would take her for walks every day, and worked hard to train her. She’s happy, frisky, and loves to be snuggled. When we saw her running towards us as the session started, we knew we were in for some fun. Honestly, is there anything better than spending a beautiful evening photographing wonderful people and a happy pet? Not for me there isn’t.

Really nice images though, really crisp and wonderfully edited, good work. A Brief History of The Portrait: Part 1 Posted by rnl on May 24, 2011 The history of art is filled with portraiture. From cave paintings dating 27,000 years ago, to that awesome photo of your little one you took with your iPhone — human beings have always been drawn to capturing each other in art. Portraits have evolved in so many ways since their beginning, from the medium, to the purpose, and the presentation. But one thing has always remained the same: the motive.<query> what is the history of portraits</query> The aim of Art is to present not the outward appearance of things, but their inner significance; for this, not the external manner and detail, constitutes true reality. - Aristotle, Greek philosopher What is a Portrait? A portrait is an attempt to portray the inner essence of the subject. It doesn’t just show what someone looks like, but should show more of who they are—their personality, mood, values, and place in time. See, a portrait is not just an image but rather a piece of history; both personal and social. It shows not only what people looked like, and how they interacted with their world, but also reveals details about what the artist themselves thought to be important in their work. My portraits are more about me than they are about the people I photograph.- Richard Avedon, fashion & portrait photographer Looking at portraits from the past lets you learn so much about people and culture.<query> what is the purpose of portrait</query> On a rainy day in suburban Edmonton it’s a wonderful memory to revisit :) travel 2 comments Leave a comment Email this post Link to this post gino – Jun. 16, 2011 at 7:26 p.m. Instant favorite.. love this photo.. Lauren – Jun. 17, 2011 at 10:21 a.m. Thanks so much Gino! It's a big fav of ours too :) Jocelyn & Chris // More Portraits Posted by rnl on June 9, 2011 The only thing I love more than photographing awesome people is getting to photograph them more than once. We photographed these two adorable people just over a year ago. When the flowers bloomed a couple weeks ago, it was time to meet up again. Jocelyn and Chris are truly incredible people. I don’t know if I can really do them justice in words.<query> where is jocelyn and chris</query> What was important to them? How did they feel about themselves? How did they value art? Portraits are wonderfully complex and full of subtle insight. The word itself has taken on many meanings over the years. It originated from the mid 16th century, from the Old French wordportraire, meaning portray. Portrait is often used literally to describe “a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person, especially one depicting only the face or head and shoulders”. But it can suggest more abstract concepts as well. You can create a portrait of an animal, an object, a city, or a culture. Though it has many meanings, the purpose of a portrait is simply to portray significance. The First Portraits The earliest semblances of a portrait came from a cave in Angoulême, France. It was a stylized representation of an eye, nose and mouth.<query> what is the meaning of portrait</query> This depiction of the human face was created long before any form of writing. We can know so much from a portrait that no words are necessary to communicate the message. There are surviving painted portraits from as early as the 2nd century CE. The largest group are the incrediblefunerary paintings from the Faiyum Basin in Egypt —realistic representations of affluent citizens attached to their mummies. They were painted on wooden surfaces with either wax paints or egg-based tempera. There is something absolutely mesmerizing about these pieces. Naturally the Greeks have something to say about the portrait. They are often considered the pinnacle of sculpture, and their ability to render the human face in marble is astonishing. What’s particularly interesting about the way the Greeks approached portraits is in their use ofidealism. They portrayed people as the perfect example of the human form.<query> what is the greek portrait</query> Their sculptures were initially of gods, so when they began to sculpt real people they were shown in a similar fashion. One of the greatest sculptors of Classical Greece was Lysippos, famous for being the only artistAlexander the Great would allow to portray him. Lysippos’ work was elegant and graceful, often showing figures appearing quite tall. His sculptures of Alexander showed him as statuesque and godlike. Given that Alexander was short and stocky, his choice of Lysippos as his sculptor was less about physical accuracy, and more about presenting an idealized image. Then the Romans came along. They were inspired by the Greek sculptors, but soon incorporated their own philosophy ofverism. Verism comes from the Latin verus, meaning “true”. It is the “preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature”.<query> who was the greatest sculptor of classical greece</query> It focuses on the reality of the subject, often producing what are considered “unflattering” portraits. All imperfections were included in an attempt to show the truth. The Romans saw it as a sign of character to have a portrait created like this. It suggested being unconcerned with vanity, and of having experience in life. Painted Portraits As art progressed, painting became more popular, and so portraits were created in colours rather than marble. And yet the motive didn’t change. Artists were looking to communicate something essential to their subject. As always, the face was the focal point of the portrait. In many cases the face was completed first, and then the rest of the painting was created afterwards. The tradition was to have a serious expression, with the majority of the emotion portrayed by the eyes. Painted portraits were quite diverse.<query> why were portraits created</query> They could be created with many different lengths (full length, half length, head and shoulders or just the head), the background was sometimes indoors and sometimes outdoors. Some painters would require only one sitting, while Cezanne famously required over 100. In general the portrait would take around a year to create. The experience of the sitting was incredibly important to the final product. The artist had to encourage a natural pose from the subject, and put them at ease. They studied their face for the one expression that they would capture that reflected the true essence. As the sittings would take quite a long time, many great artists were skilled at keeping their subject engaged with conversation. The value of these portraits is described when Count Balthazar thanked Raphael for the portrait of his wife, and said “Your image…alone can lighten my cares.<query> how long does it take to paint a portrait</query> That image is my delight; I direct my smiles to it, it is my joy.” The Renaissance Portraits gained in importance during the Renaissance. They became highly valued in society, and were used to record status and position. The great artists likeLeonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael were considered geniuses rather than mere craftsmen. During this time oil painting was mastered byJan van Eyck, which led to greater detail and realism. He painted the famousArnolfini Portrait , a portrait of a married (or betrothed) couple. This was when one of the most famous portraits in history was created: the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci was a master of the portrait, and his ability to capture the inner essence of Lisa del Giocondo has had people marvelling and wondering in front of the piece for nearly 500 years. The Baroque to the 19th Century As time passed, the portrait became increasingly popular.<query> who painted the mona lisa</query> While many artists were still in pursuit of the true essence, others created works that had a more idealistic perspective. In the famous painting,Napoleon Crossing the Alps, by Jacques-Louis David, Bonaparte is shown in a heroic pose, on a “firey horse”, with a dramatic sky behind him. The reality was not quite so legendary, however. He actually crossed on a nice day, riding a mule! The subjects of portrait paintings were expanding beyond the wealthy. Vermeer was known for his painting of middle class, domestic life, with subjects like a milkmaid, a girl in a piano lesson, and an astronomer. His portraits provided a look at 17th century Dutch society. Other advances were happening at this time, from Rembrandt exploring the many expressions capable on the human face, to the group portraits being produced in the Netherlands.<query> who painted napoleon crossing the alps</query> Female painters were gaining importance, especially in portraiture. Mary Cassatt, an American painter, was famous for her series of paintings that showed the relationship between mother and child. As artists began to look towards the middle class, the desire for portraits increased. Full size paintings were too expensive, so the portrait miniature — a small portrait, often kept in a locket — became highly valuable. Then, in 1835, Louis Daguerre accidentally broke a mercury thermometer, and the portrait changed. Big time.

The Most Exclusive Cemetery in Argentina Posted by photoconcentrate on May 17, 2011 I’m going to start sharing some of our adventures from Argentina on this blog!We experienced so much, we need to make sure we write about it before we forget! So let’s start off with a definitely different sort of adventure… When we were in Buenos Aires we stayed in Recoleta, the poshest neighbourhood in the city. If you’ve met us, you’ll probably know that we’re anything but posh (we still wear Vans sneakers every single day!).<query> where is the most exclusive cemetery in argentina</query> But we wanted this trip to be a chance to expand and experience, so Recoleta sounded like a perfect spot. A short walk from our apartment was La Recoleta Cemetery, the most exclusive final resting place in Argentina. Apparently it’s not even a matter of how much money you have, butwho you know, when it comes to getting a spot in there. The people here are definitely a big deal. The cemetery itself is possibly one of the oddest tourist attractions we’ve visited. It’s essentially a small city—but the residents are no longer breathing. It was crowded with tourists every day—guidebooks and cameras outnumbering graves. We thought we’d stop in a few times to take photos, but we only went once. It was pretty heavy—completely surrounded by masoleums, and the faces and names of the dead. Even now, looking through the images, I find the whole experience quite difficult to describe… So, on that rather vague note, here are some photos we took while visiting the most exclusive cemetery in Argentina. Photographer’s note: Most of the images are actually taken with the SonyNEX-3, not a DSLR.<query> where is recoleta cemetery</query> More details to come :) travel 3 comments Leave a comment Email this post Link to this post Mindy Shamp – May. 17, 2011 at 6:36 p.m. I'm so curious about this place, and love your photos! My hubby & I have been considering grabbing the NEX-3 (or 5) for months and can't decide. We love to travel, but don't want to bring both dSLRs everywhere. What lens(es) do you use on the Sony? That's the only thing we're unsure of, the lenses. Can't wait to hear more about this camera, thanks for sharing your adventures! Lauren – May. 17, 2011 at 11:14 p.m. Hey Mindy! Thanks so much for the super kind comment! I used the NEX-3 for the entire month, and loved it.<query> what lens do you use on a sony nex 3</query> It was so much lighter and easier to carry around, which was seriously valuable. I used the 16mm and the 18-55mm. They were really decent. Not as fast and sharp as pro lenses, of course, but really decent quality. Will definitely be posting a LOT more about it soon, so stay tuned! Carey – Sep. 1, 2011 at 8:14 p.m. Great shot guys. It really brings me back to the day we spent there. What an incredible place! Side story: A bird crapped on Colleens' head while were there... I thought it was really funny. She didn't. Frances, Duff + Chomp // A Portrait Session in Buenos Aires Posted by rnl on May 12, 2011 Have you ever met someone for the first time, and felt like you already knew them?<query> what is the best lens for a portrait session</query> I got that feeling so strongly with Frances and Duff that it totally messed with my mind! I kept having to remind myself that we had only hung out once, because it felt like we were old buds. We met these guys through my sister’s blog. She connected with Frances because they both have food blogs. My sister found out that Frances lives in Buenos Aires, where Rob and I were hanging out for the month. We got their email address, dropped them a line, and asked if they wanted to go eat some tasty food together. See, we love food. All food. And anyone who can show us great places to eat in a new city is an instant friend! The bonus with Frances and Duff? They are just downright awesome people. They’rephotographers (hey, so are we!), travellers (yep, we like that too), foodies (we love food), and just two cool people living a fun life.<query> where does frances and duff live</query> We clicked instantly, and as soon as we walked away from our first dinner together Rob and I both knew that we would have to take their portraits before we left. So one day we hopped on the train, and journeyed out to San Isidro, a absolutely beautiful little suburb of Buenos Aires where these two live. We had no idea what the place would look like, and were just going to go with the flow. Um, we lucked out. BIG TIME. This has to be one of the most beautiful, relaxed, and enjoyable places we’ve ever shot! Amazing colours, architecture, and just a really chill vibe. After a few weeks in the hustle and bustle of downtown Buenos Aires, it was exactly what we needed. And the shoot itself was a true joy. We strolled around with these guys and their adorable pup Chomp, and just had fun together.<query> where is san isidro</query> Chatting, laughing, and stopping every few feet to take more photos! We finished off the night with nachos (kinda my favourite thing) and it was perfect. Frances and Duff, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You made our trip 100X better. We can’t wait until our paths cross again!! Tons of love, Lauren (and Rob) :) If you want to see more shots from this session, including those too silly for the blog, head over to ourFacebook page, “Like” it, and then click on Photos.

I love my canon rebel but would love a little pocket sized goodie too - thanks for the recommendation guys :) Transcend Coffee // Portrait of a Business Posted by rnl on June 2, 2011 We have an unconventional concept of a “portrait”.<query> where is tall grass</query> Historically it referred to a likeness of a person in art, with an emphasis on the face and expression. But, as we explored the idea of “portrait” in our work, we found that for us it referred more to capturing theessence of someone—or something—in whatever manner best fit. If you live in Edmonton and are into coffee, you’ve heard of Transcend. They started out as one small cafe in an industrial area of the town. They carefully roasted their own beans, and did such a great job that they started expanding. Today they have a dedicated roastery, three cafes, two of which are in the busiest parts of town (the University area and Jasper Ave), and a growing online business. They’re really really good at what they do. We spent a day with the Transcend gang to create a portrait of what they do.<query> where is transcend coffee</query> We asked a billion questions, listened, watched, and photographed everything. In the end we can come up with one simple word that explains their success:passion. Their passion for great coffee is so strong that the entire journey, from bean to cup, is handled with an unbelievable amount of care and dedication. Check out the Moving Portrait below to get a sense of just how much work goes into creating a seemingly simple latte! Music Credit: Kevin MacLoed We really love coffee, and have been big fans of Transcend for years, but had no idea just how much work goes on behind-the-scenes. It’s a process, rigorously executed, to ensure the absolute highest quality coffee. We had such an amazing time getting to see how much they care about what they do. We really hope you enjoy this look at how Transcend puts passion into their business.<query> what is the passion behind transcend coffee</query> From Bean To Cup The roastery is filled with the traditional burlap bags that hold the makings of a cup of coffee. These are the green coffee beans, shipped from origin. Coffee beans are actually seeds of coffee cherries, from the coffee tree. Poul, the founder of Transcend, travels frequently to South America to work directly with the farmers growing these trees. He not only tries to find the absolute best product, but helps the farmers learn how to make even better beans. Great coffee starts with great beans. Every morning during the week, Transcend roasts their own coffee in small batches. Kate, the roaster, comes in and warms up the huge machine. Then she gets down to it. She measures out the green coffee beans. Each batch is carefully weighed for consistency. Then the beans go into the roaster.<query> where does transcend coffee come from</query>"

Encouraging small groups of students to ask and answer their own questions Having the whole class answer the same questions Letting student-generated questions drive the investigations within the unit (you might guide them by making a shorter list from their questions)<query> what questions should i ask my students</query> Encouraging students to question each other on their findings so students will justify their conclusions to each other Encouraging students to justify their findings by asking them ""How do you know?"" while guiding them in learning how to rely on evidence. How Autumn taught this lesson Because Autumn had already taught the ecosystems unit, her students understood that decomposers play an important role in breaking matter down into smaller pieces. She decided to review their results from the decomposition lesson, in which they observed apples decaying in plastic bags. The students recalled that the apple began to decompose after a while but, when Autumn then asked them if the bag had decomposed too, the students responded no. So, as a driving question for this lesson, she proposed that the class try to answer the question: why did the apple decompose but not the plastic bag?<query> why do apples decompose</query> After performing their investigations, the students found that some types of trash decompose faster than others items like plastics and metal. She asked the students to think about the original question and whether or not both plastic bags and apples end up in landfills. How could the evidence from their investigations help answer the driving question? Students inferred from their observations that plastic bags would stay in dumps for a lot longer than apples. Autumn felt her students were ready to use this knowledge in the next lesson to explore why the choices they make in their own lives are important. Teacher Bios Who are the (fictional) teachers depicted in the Images of Inquiry? Autumn Autumn is a third-year 5th-grade teacher. She is very positive about teaching science and wants her students to be well-prepared to deal with science-related issues in their real lives, something she considers very important.<query> what is the purpose of the images of inquiry</query> Through one of her undergraduate science courses, Autumn had the opportunity to work on a water-quality study for one of her professors. She now volunteers doing outreach for a conservation organization in her community. However, while Autumn feels comfortable with her ability to help her kids understand science concepts, she also wants to learn how to better help them understand and make decisions about science in society as well as improve her subject matter knowledge. Author(s): CASES Team<query> what is autumn's passion for science</query> Divide the pan into 6 areas, and bury a small piece (about 1 cc) of material in each area. Place a plant label or ice cream stick in each area, telling what material is buried there and whether they think it is biodegradable or not. Every other day for two weeks, dig up the substance and describe its appearance, smell, etc. in their science journal. How has it changed? Why? What materials show little or no change? Why not? Why should students collect evidence to answer questions? Collecting evidence Engages students in working and thinking like scientists Engages students in gathering the evidence needed to draw conclusions Facilitates problem solving skills Facilitates understanding of content Facilitates inquiry abilities How can I help my students collect evidence? Encourage students to actively participate in planning and designing investigations whenever possible Have students develop a way to record the data they collect (data table, journal, etc.)<query> why should students collect evidence to answer questions?</query> When possible, have students double-check their measurements and repeat experiments to verify the accuracy of their data. Provide students access to as many resources as possible, including the Internet, books, magazines, etc. Model how you expect students to gather and record their data Note: Learning to describe things is an important skill of scientific inquiry. Encourage students to draw and label pictures and to show how objects have changed from their last observation (otherwise, their entries might look the same each day). The first few days of observation, it is a good idea to model the process for students. Write a sample journal entry on the board so students can learn what you expect. After the two weeks are over, discuss and have students write about these questions: Which of your groups' items was biodegradable?<query> how to teach science to students</query> How do you know? Which was not biodegradable? How do you know? Note: Asking ""How do you know?"" is important because it encourages students to provide evidence for their opinions - this is an important skill of scientific inquiry. If you were to dump a bagfull of each item in a landfill, which item would take up the least space after a month? How do you know? How can making choices to buy things that are biodegradable influence the amount of space in the landfill in your community? Why should students draw conclusions based on evidence? Engages students in working and thinking like scientists (For example, in science, opinions are judged by how strongly they are supported by evidence. Students often think that any opinion is as valid as any other opinion) Facilitates problem solving skills Facilitates understanding of content Facilitates inquiry abilities How can I help students draw conclusions based on evidence?<query> why should students draw conclusions based on evidence?</query> Encourage students to draw conclusions based on evidence by working with classmates to analyze the data collected during an investigation using the data as evidence when drawing conclusions asking questions like, What data should we keep? What data should we discard? What patterns exist in the data? Are the patterns appropriate for this investigation? What explanations account for the patterns? Is one explanation better than another? If your students dont have much experience working in this way, guide them step by step through analyzing the data and drawing conclusions. Why should students communicate and justify their findings? When students share their findings, they are participating in an important part of the scientific process. Provides students with an opportunity to enhance and expand their ideas, grapple with the findings of their peers, and improve communication skills.<query> why should students communicate their findings</query>"

clueweb12-0007wb-27-27149,70,1,"Google Research Search Search Google Research: Home About us Research Blog Publications Video University Relations Work at Google Other Google resources Google Code Google Scholar Follow us on Twitter Why work at Google? Hear what Research Scientist T.V. Raman has to say about working at Google Google’s mission: Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google is an engineering company. The Google web site is powered by some amazing technology, most of it developed in-house. Yet people often ask us what we do here at Google Engineering. “What are you working on? Isn’t search a solved problem?” Glad you asked. We’re working on lots of interesting stuff and one of the main reasons is that search is far from a solved problem.<query> why do you work at google</query> It's got lots of really smart people, amazing technology, fun problems, and a chance to make a real difference in the world. Does this sound like an environment in which you would thrive? See all of our current Software Engineering openings! ©2012 Google<query> what is software engineering</query> Perhaps you’re interested in Norse mythology and search for information about “Thor”. The results page shows “Results 1-10” out of millions of links. That seems like a lot of information, but look at the results. Mixed in with information about the god of thunder there may be links to sites about medical equipment companies, bus builders, comic superheroes, even a movie. To someone looking for those other Thors, the Norse god is less interesting; to you, though, it's the other way around. Google prides itself on its algorithm for choosing the most relevant pages, but search hascontext, which is just one of the considerations in choosing the right results. Plus, the top pages listed are all in English; surely there are some interesting web pages in Norwegian (or even Old Norse) that we could translate for you, and chances are at least some of them deserve high ranking.<query> what is the norse god of thunder</query> And whether we’re asking about the god, the superhero, the equipment, or the movie, there should be images, maybe movies or animations, and other rich content available; how do we find that? Plus there are many other sources of information about Thor (the god) that the web doesn’t reach: ancient sagas, oral histories; who knows? So yes, Google is very good at searching the web for relevant pages for the query you type, but the web isn’t enough and `relevant' is a relative term. The search problem remains far from solved. The web really is only part of the story. There's the information the web doesn’t reach and then there's personal information like mail and photos. How about the schedule of the bus you take every morning? The schedule of the busthis morning?<query> what is the web?</query> The view from the beachfront timeshare you’re thinking of renting next summer? The best route to the concert? Whether that cough is worth seeing a doctor about? Information defines the modern world; making it available and helpful is our mission. Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater scope. We have our work cut out for us. Feel like helping? You don’t need to be an expert on searching. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas from just about every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design; the list goes on. Or look at it this way: a typical query to Google can touch thousands of machines before returning the answer.<query> what is google's mission</query> With all those machines and all that communication, the problems can be daunting and new ideas and new technologies can always be brought to bear. And then there are all the specialist domains: geospatial information (mapping), bioinformatics (health and genetics), image processing (photos, video), and on and on. Wherever you live, there's likely to be a Google engineering office nearby. Google has engineering centers in cities throughout the US and all around the world. Each office works on problems big and small, global and local, according on the particular strengths of the engineers in the area. We want to hire the best people we can, regardless of where they live. The Story So Far The problems are tough, but we've made significant progress. Besides constructing the world's most heavily used web search engine and a lot of other public web services (www.google.com, news.google.com, images.google.com, groups.google.com, catalogs.google.com, labs.google.com,<query> where is google engineering located</query> maps.google.com, gmail.google.com, scholar.google.com, adwords.google.com), not to mention the Google Appliance and the Google Toolbar, Google Engineering has achieved a number of other milestones you may not be as familiar with: We designed and built an advertising system that automatically performs hundreds of millions of automated auctions per day to determine the placement and prices ofadvertisements appearing on Google search result pages and non-search pages on dozens of other sites. We built a very large scale, distributed, fault-tolerant file system, called GFS, to help manage and process huge data sets. Apaper in SOSP 2003 describes the file system. We designed and developed a fully automatic news system (news.google.com), which has rapidly become a standard tool for human journalists. Custom algorithms group together articles about the same story from different news organizations from around the world, providing diverse viewpoints about the day's events.<query> what is google engineering</query> Heuristics judge the importance of each story relative to other stories in the news around the world to generate our headline summary pages automatically. We built a searchable archive of millions of catalog pages by scanning and OCR'ing printed catalogs. This experimental service demonstrates the benefits of a searchable interface for information not previously easy to search or browse. We’re exploring large-scale machine learning as a means of improving search quality. Our spelling correction system is one excellent example (spehl korector? phonitick spewling? who needs a dictniary?). People searching for Britney Spears have clearly found it useful on many occasions. In more recent work, we have been working on algorithms and techniques to construct very large scale Bayesian network models to help understand the relationships between words. We are building a large-scale public e-mail system capable of storing 2 GB of data per user, with a unique user interface that centers around search, scaling to many millions of users.<query> what is the purpose of large scale machine learning</query> All this is achieved by connecting together tens of thousands of servers behindgoogle.com and providing them with a lot of custom-built, cutting-edge, innovative software. It should be clear by now that the search problem involves much more than just searching, and that some of the most exciting work at Google happens behind the scenes. We’re also working on a number of interesting projects at the moment that are too preliminary to discuss here, and we’re always looking for new and interesting ideas. Who we are Who did all this? A dedicated and growing team of smart, creative programmers and computer scientists – but we just call them engineers. They come to Google with expertise in a large range of topics. And before they joined Google, some of them also built software, hardware, tools and other technology you might have used: A Bug's Life The Apache Software Foundation Alpha CPUs and Alpha-based Multiprocessor Systems Apple Lisa Aspect-oriented Programming ATOM (A Tool for Object-file Modification) Cilk CiteSeer Cyrus IMAP DCPI Deep Space 1 The Digital Michelangelo Project Epi Info FLASH Project FreeBSD GIGAswitch/ATM (Autonet 2) Gimp Gnome Gnumeric GNU findutils gtk The Human Genome Project Hyperbolic Browsing ical IEEE Std 1003.1, POSIX Interlisp Itsy Pocket Computer Java HotSpot The Java Virtual Machine Specification JScheme lex (by our CEO!)

Some love thinking long and hard about difficult problems; others just enjoy getting their hands dirty building and deploying massive, real-world systems. What they all share, though, is an enthusiasm for the challenge of making the world a better place through the intelligent application of information technology. It's a blast. Interested? There is so much still to be done, so many hard (but fun!) problems to solve, so much information in the world, we'd like some of you to join us to help us in our task of making Google even better. The engineering challenges we face at Google are exciting and the perks of working here are wonderful, but the real reason most of our engineers came here is that Google Engineering is a great place to work.<query> why do engineers work at google</query>"

So yeah, Google is my primary research tool. It's also my mother's. Collectively, our dependence on Google is not a problem because it allegedly weakens our faculties. It's a problem because Google bakes biases into its algorithms. And we fail to recognize that fact. Most of the time, we can't even discern what they are. Most of the recent changes in Google's search algorithms make Google much better for shopping and much worse for learning. That could make us collectively dumber, but not individually. That's why we need a fresh approach to how we manage our information ecosystem. The same service cannot serve wisdom and wealth equally well. I'm sorry. What was the question?<query> why is google a problem</query> I got distracted by YouTube for a moment... Q: At a digital scholarship conference last fall, I watched Daniel M. Russell, a senior research scientist at Google in charge of “user happiness,” give an academic audience a demonstration of what treasures lie in the depths of Google’s trove — a facsimile of Stravinsky’s score from “Sacre du Printemps,” a 3-D model of the Notre Dame Cathedral, unemployment data for Santa Clara County over the last 20 years — before lamenting that most students have no idea how to find them. The implication was that Google has created this rich, open vault that students love to use but which colleges are failing to teach them to use effectively. To what extent can better training and education realistically solve this problem? A: Well, I am not sure training is the gap here.<query> who is daniel russell</query> Google keeps rolling out cool features and services faster than we can fold them into our habits and curricula. A couple of weeks ago Google unveiled a really cool high-definition tool to explore major art works in museums. Every day I plan to use it to show my daughter some of her favorite works. But every evening I forget to do that because I just can't get out of the tangle of links connecting YouTube videos. Google has not figured out how to connect with the right faculty in the right numbers for many of its services. But it's not really Google's fault. Perhaps each university should assign a librarian to be the Chief Google Officer so she or he could hip faculty to the newest, coolest things. Q: Lest our readers assume that your book is a frothing, techno-phobic screed penned by a dyed-in-the-tweed academic who lives to prove that any large, profitable company is necessarily sinister and exploitative, I should mention that you actually have some quite nice things to say about Google in these pages.<query> why is google not hiring a librarian</query> What is the greatest contribution Google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life? A: Google made the Web usable. Before this clean and useful search tool, using the Web well meant starting at a trusted point and following trusted links. That's why it is called a ""web."" With decent search one can just drop down into a new part of the Web, skipping over the useless and icky parts. Google actually cleaned up the Web — or at least our experience of it. Not long ago simple searches for double entendres like ""facial"" would yield anything but links to the cosmetic spa treatment. Google's biases — what it calls standards — effectively hide the most troublesome links deep in the search results. You can find the yucky stuff by searching for exactly what you might want.<query> what is the greatest contribution google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life?</query> But you are unlikely to stumble upon bad stuff accidentally. This is a great service, but one with real costs at the margins. Beyond that, Google Docs is a major service to higher education. It's the easiest and most dependable way to allow multiple authors and editors to work on a document together. It lacks the useless gizmos that infect Microsoft Office. I use the Google Docs presentation software to run slides for class because it's simple, dependable, and can host embedded YouTube videos. Did I mention that I spend too much time on YouTube? That said, I believe it's incumbent on universities to ensure maximum user confidentiality and data security for any Google product. I don't believe universities have been strong or effective negotiators for their students' and faculties' interests when it comes to using Google services.<query> why use google docs</query> There should be a collective set of best practices for when universities deploy third-party services that collect user data. Q: Your book culminates with a proposal for an alternative to Google’s “hyper-commercialized, data-mined, advertising-directed” model — working title: the Human Knowledge Project. Contrary to Google, this project would set the agenda for the creation of a information system that is public, comprehensive, civic-minded, and strong enough to outlast its colorful, colossal counterpart. How plausible is it that a confederation of relatively cash-poor and fractious public institutions might actually shoulder the resolve and unity of vision to field a more stable alternative to Google? Does any part of you fear that what “the Googlization of everything” has taken from humanity, humanity lacks the will to reclaim?<query> what is the human knowledge project</query> A: The Human Knowledge Project would be a 50-year public, global plan to design, legislate for, enable, and fund a global digital library service to deliver the best information to the most people. It's as feasible as it is desirable. In other words, if we don't do it it's because we don't really want it. States are only as cash-poor as they choose to be. States are only as incompetent as they are designed to be. The fractured nature of public discourse could be the source of strength for such a project as long as we all agree on the terms of debate and the over-arching goal: that no child growing up in Sweden should have better access to better information than a child growing up in Rwanda would have. If we don't agree to that, then we should not pursue the Human Knowledge Project.<query> why is the human knowledge project not feasible</query> If we do agree, then let's start a political campaign for it. Let's figure out the steps we need to take. Let's change the laws we need to change. Let's raise the money we need to raise. The goal would not be to oust or push Google. The goal would be to build what we want and need without resorting to cheap, short-term fixes. If anyone should ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible,"" it should be the world itself.

Later, Page and Brin would rely on university largesse in the early days of the Google Book Search project, when major research libraries allowed the company to scan huge portions of their collections for free. In return, Google has given higher education Google Scholar, which provides a popular bridge to otherwise obscure academic research; Google Apps for Education, which enables universities to use the company’s e-mail and communications tools, and its huge server capacity, for free; and, of course, Google Book Search — which, despite its discomfiting monopoly, gives scholars a more comprehensive body of digitized literature than has ever existed.<query> who is google founder</query> “Google,” Vaidhyanathan observes, “is an example of a stunningly successful firm behaving as much like a university as it can afford to.” But as is often the case with cousins, the genetic differences between higher education and Google are more striking than their similarities. Beneath the interdependence and shared hereditary traits, tensions creep. And like an awkward Thanksgiving dinner, Vaidhyanathan’s new book,The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry) (University of California Press), provokes these tensions to the surface. The Virginia professor, who is not afraid to confess his affection for the ease and usefulness of Google, nevertheless distrusts the company’s basic motivations as it vies for our intellectual inheritance. “Google has fostered a more seamless, democratized, global, cosmopolitan information ecosystem,” he writes. “Yet it has simultaneously contributed to the steady commercialization of higher education and the erosion of standards of information quality.” Google does not reward our impulse to know, Vaidhyanathan argues; it exploits it by making it appear as though knowing is easy.<query> who is google professor</query> “The ways that Google structures, judges, and delivers knowledge to us exacerbate our worst tendencies to jump to erroneous conclusions and act on them in ways that cause harm,” the professor writes. Meanwhile the company keeps collecting, on behalf of its advertisers, the wealth of personal information that we feed it in exchange for this flattery, then pats its own back all the way to the bank. Vaidhyanathan’s point is not that Google has scammed us. He attributes the ascension of Google to a “public failure” — negligence by public stewards to preempt the privatization of knowledge and learning in the switch from analog to digital. In other words, we should have seen this coming. Did Google’s academic bloodlines lull higher education into passively supporting Page and Brin as they quietly absconded with the family jewels? Perhaps, but Vaidhyanathan is less concerned with how we got here than where we are and where we’re going.<query> who is google</query> Accordingly, he proposes a sprawling effort by libraries and like-minded institutions that would essentially give Googlers a public option. “The future of knowledge — and thus the future of the species — depends on our getting this right,” he writes. Inside Higher Ed caught up with Vaidhyanathan, whose Wikipedia page credits him with coining the term “Critical Information Studies,” though it does not cite its source. Q: You admit early on that your book has an “overtly political” agenda: greater government regulation of Google. When a company exerts such control over public goods — like, say, a digital archive of 130 million books comprising the entire living history of human thought — oversight by public authorities becomes necessary, you argue. One might counter that public institutions are potentially just as compromising.<query> who coined the term critical information studies?</query> To the extent that regulation would transfer power over the basic infrastructure of knowledge and learning from Google to the government, might we simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization? A: While I argue that we should consider — not fear — the prospect of regulating Google, I stop short of prescribing much in the way of specific regulation. My goal is to convince readers that Google is already highly regulated, so it's dumb to say that Google should remain unregulated. More importantly, I want to raise the prospect of whether Google and the Internet in general are properly regulated. That, to me, is the grown-up way to approach the question. Right now Google is haphazardly and clumsily regulated. Copyright stops Google and others from doing clever, useful things. Antitrust is too toothless to provide serious competition in online, search-based advertisements.<query> why is google unregulated</query> Most important from the perspective of the values important to a democratic republic, Google's search standards are opaque and potentially corrupt. That's whythe European Union is examining them. I don't believe Google's search results are corrupted. I do believe they very well could be in the near future. And there is no guarantee that the next company that governs search would be named Google. As to the direct questions about whether the transfer of authority from firm to state would ""simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization,"" I say exactly! Politicization means that citizens battle over competing visions of the good. That's what we are supposed to do in a democratic republic. Fundamentally, we must recognize that some things are too important to be entrusted to unaccountable private actors. There may be hazards.<query> why is google search corrupt</query> But they are our hazards. Q: As you write, it is not just our institutions that are being “Googlized”; so are our minds and habits. Some surveys have suggested that nearly half of college students use Google as their primary research tool. “Googlized” students have poor memories and inflated expectations about how much effort it takes to dig up definitive answers. A Greek chorus of tsk-ing academics has all but declared this a preamble to the Twitter-apocalypse. Are they right? A: I don't subscribe to the ""Google is making us dumber"" position. I think Google is allowing us to be differently smart. I also refuse to bracket off my students as some exotic tribe that behaves and reacts differently than I do or my mother does. We are all in this crazy environment together.<query> why is google making us dumber</query>"

Employees: 20,621 2009 Revenue: $23.6 billion CEO: Eric Schmidt What They Do: Google gets most of its revenue from search advertising, but it has high aspirations for its Enterprise division and its flagship product, Apps Premier. The hosted collaboration and communication suite includes applications for e-mail, calendar, office productivity, intranet, video sharing and discussion forums. The Pitch Google Apps Premier offers enterprises cloud-based messaging and collaboration software intended to cost less and to be simpler to deploy and manage than on-premise systems. Unlike the free Standard edition, Premier offers IT management tools to support enterprise software integration, user provisioning and migration among its capabilities.<query> where is google headquarters</query> At first, CIOs didn’t bite, but during the past three years, Google has steadily strengthened Premier’s features and security. Today, customers include companies as diverse as Genentech and Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), with thousands of users. Rajen Sheth, a Google Apps senior product manager, says Gmail has been Premier’s main attraction, but now Google is beefing up its Docs office productivity suite to better compete with Microsoft (MSFT) Office. “It’s an area we’re ready to delve into a lot more deeply now,” Sheth says. “Going forward, we’ll be able to offer them a choice for office productivity.” The catchIBM ( IBM) and Microsoft are moving fast to tweak their Lotus Notes and Exchange products—as well as release new ones—to provide the cost savings and management benefits of hosted suites like Google Apps.<query> who is google premier</query> Meanwhile, end users may resist the switch from familiar applications. The Schumacher Group, a healthcare company, bought 2,000 Premier seats to provide e-mail for doctors who are independent contractors. But full-time employees are sticking with Exchange, in part to avoid the change-management process, says CIO Douglas Menefee. The city of Orlando, Fla., trained 3,000 users on Premier Gmail, calendar and contacts. But Google Docs will wait until PCs deployed two years ago with Microsoft Office 2007 are no longer usable, CIO Conrad Cross says. The usual concerns about cloud computing—whether storing data off-premise is secure, and worries about bugs, outages and performance issues over which IT departments have no control—also apply. What’s more, say CIOs, Google has much to learn about cultivating relationships with enterprise customers.<query> who is the cio of google docs</query> Omnetic, the Schumacher Group’s Premier reseller and integrator, enjoys good communication with enterprise engineers at Google, and Menefee has sales contacts there. “But I don’t feel I have solid communications with Google from the support and engineering perspectives,” he says. The scoreNucleus Research analyst Rebecca Wettemann says Google has moved quickly in the past year to make Apps Premier a viable choice for CIOs. “Google has taken important steps in terms of usability, performance, reliability and, most important, providing guidance to enterprises on how to deploy these tools effectively,” she says. However, there’s no simple answer for CIOswho wonder if the suite is a good fit for their companies. “You have to know what the cost of providing the service internally is,” Cross says. “Otherwise, you won’t know what your savings will be and why it would be to your advantage to adopt Apps.” Cross also warns that while ditching an on-premise system for Apps reduces the IT staff’s internal server-maintenance work, it doesn’t mean IT executives can abdicate their management roles.<query> is google apps premier a good fit for a cio</query> You still have to make sure Google meets its obligations, he says.

Posted in Uncategorized | 2 Comments » MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM December 22nd, 2011 by Robert Bismuth MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM Android 4.0.3 came out from Google on Friday December 16th and who could resist the challenge? So, MIPS engineers picked up the release from the Google source tree and ported it to MIPS within 24 hours.<query> what is mips</query> In fact, they decided to push through the weekend and bring 4.0.3 up on the Ingenic/Ainol tablet. Thus we were able to give Ainol a head start towards an over the air (OTA) upgrade for tablets sold to-date plus schedule a switch over to 4.0.3 for new tablets. But there is more here than just our dedication to supporting MIPS’ licensees and the Android community … Android 4.0 expands on Google’s use of LLVM, and MIPS completely supports this initiative – in fact, when Google adopted LLVM 3.0 as the basis of Renderscript in Android 4.0.3, MIPS support was already available. So, what is LLVM, and why is it important for the Android community? LLVM – Low Level Virtual Machine – is an umbrella for modular compiler technologies. It includes a C/C++ compiler front-end, a portable code generator supporting a wide variety of architectures, an aggressive optimizer, and an efficient just-in-time (JIT) compiler on the back-end.<query> what is llvm</query> Renderscript, the first technology in Android to use LLVM, first became popular in HoneyComb (Android 3.0)–as a set of low-level APIs targeting 3D rendering and compute operations. In fact Renderscript is an example of using the high-performance APIs provided by LLVM to achieve the same level of system performance that developers could expect were they instead to use native code on the underlying device. But unlike the existing Android native development kit (NDK), this solution is cross-platform – meaning that applications built using this technology can run on several architectures supported by LLVM. The inclusion of MIPS optimizations for LLVM in Google’s Android 4.0.3 release takes a great step in making LLVM available for more general use by app developers seeking to exploit native processor performance and capabilities while retaining complete portability in the Android universe.<query> what is renderscript</query> So what’s behind this LLVM push for Android? MIPS actually became involved in the industry’s LLVM initiative over a year ago – before it became generally available in Android. This was when MIPS’ compiler group realized that LLVM was going to be a major basis for applications in the future. LLVM had already been the basis of Apple’s application environment for the iPhone and iPad. Our engineers felt that it was only a matter of time before it became the basis of application development environments in the wider market. We were clearly not alone in our thinking, and so LLVM first appeared in Android. By supplying our LLVM technology for the MIPS architecture to Google, we have enabled all MIPS licensees, their OEMs and application developers targeting their platforms to have access to the best possible execution environment on MIPS-based platforms, starting with Android 4.0.3.<query> when did llvm come out</query> Of course, as Android moves forward, MIPS will make further refinements to LLVM on the MIPS architecture available to Google. We will also make available other optimizations and software related to improving Android’s “out of the box” support for the MIPS architecture. Android has become an enormous force in the consumer electronics market – a market in which MIPS’ legendary performance, power efficiency and cost effectiveness have been well recognized. The MIPS architecture has already been adopted widely on just about every type of consumer device … cell phones, tablets, set-top boxes, and digital TVs to name a few. The inclusion of support for the MIPS architecture directly in this latest key facility of Android provides an even more attractive future for all of our licensees and their customers – and ultimately for the end users who continually seek out the best price/performance products available in the market and rely on those products in their day to day lives.<query> what is mips architecture</query> MIPS is moving forward with Android – as always, we are focused on going beyond simply what the market is demanding. We know that providing an enriched apps development environment benefits all end users. More apps, anywhere and any time, running on Android, running on MIPS! Posted in Uncategorized | 3 Comments » Convergence with a Caveat: Will the TV, tablet, smartphone and computer converge into one master device? December 14th, 2011 by Kevin Kitagawa The evolution of the iPhone and Android smartphones have allowed consumers to be entertained, to easily access information on-the-go and to communicate with anyone from anywhere. Need directions to the nearest gas station? Look it up on Google Maps. Need restaurant recommendations? Launch your Yelp app. Need to waste 10 minutes while waiting for someone?<query> what is mips</query> How about a few levels of Angry Birds? Want to listen to music or watch a movie away from home? You can do that. Talk, text or facetime your friends? No problem. As we all enjoy the features and functions enabled by today’s “smarter” mobile and portable devices, TVs have become smarter too. Today’s TVs are adding internet connectivity, streaming video and TV programming such as Netflix and Hulu, voice/video conferencing capabilities such as Skype, and much more. In addition, Smart TVs can access movies, pictures, and music on any DLNA capable device such as a Windows 7 machine or tablets. As these devices become more powerful and feature-rich, some people think that we will ultimately see all of the capabilities of TV, mobile phone, tablet and PC converge into one master device.<query> what is the smart tv</query> But is that really a possibility? The short answer is, I don’t think so. Battery Life Consider first the matter of battery life. Gone are the days of going a week without needing to charge our phones. Most of us constantly charge our phones at home, work and even in the car just to power a single day. Even with this constant battery charging, many of us swap in other devices to further conserve power. For example, I will use my iPod Touch to watch a movie during an hour at the gym, to be sure I have enough smartphone power for a conference call later in the day. Just imagine the incredible amount of battery life a device would need to provide in order to meet our daily usage appetite for all online/media consumption/phone activities. Today’s devices just can’t supply that.<query> why do we need to charge our phones</query> Size Matters Secondly, what size would a master device be? Watching video content on my smartphone/tablet is a bit of a compromise. While this is something I would do on a plane or while stuck waiting for hours on end somewhere, while I am at home, I much prefer to watch movies/TV shows in front of my TV. Some people have proposed that the smartphone can become a set-top box by “docking” it with the TV. This capability will definitely be possible in the near future, but I don’t see this ever replacing a dedicated set-top box that stays in the living room. There are too many questions to sort out: Whose smartphone should be used as the main set-top box? What happens if that person receives a private phone call in the middle of a live football game?<query> can a smartphone be used as a set top box</query> Programming A MIPS Core MIPS32® 74K® Class MIPS32® 34K® Class MIPS32® 24K® Class MIPS32® 24KE™ Class MIPS32® 4K® Class MIPS32® 4KE™ Class MIP32® 4KS™ Class MIPS32® M4K™ Class Certified Training Centers Private Training Programming Extension for a MIPS32® 34K™ CORE Documentation Open a Software Support Case File a License Request Ecosystem MIPS Ecosystem MIPS Alliance Members MIPS Design Centers Android on MIPS Customers Licensees News & Events Newsroom Image Library Media Contacts Release Archive 2010 Release Archive 2009 Release Archive 2008 Release Archive 2007 Release Archive 2006 Release Archive 2005 Release Archive 2004 Release Archive 2003 Industry Highlights 2009 Industry Highlights 2008 Industry Highlights 2007 Industry Highlights 2006 Industry Highlights In the News 2010 In the News 2009 In the News 2008 In the News 2007 In the News 2006 In the News Events Archive Newsletter<query> what is mips32 core</query> What happens if that person is not at home — how would the family watch a program that was recorded on that person’s phone? At least in my family, this simply wouldn’t work. Even in the future when all data will be stored remotely in the “cloud space,” and each device becomes more or less a screen with all content available on-demand, there will be a need for each device to retain its primary purpose. Primary Functions While a smartphone could operate as a master device, it’s very clear that smartphones, tablets, personal computers, set-top boxes, and TVs each have primary functions at which they excel. The smartphone is primarily a phone and mobile internet device. A tablet brings casual email and a better mobile internet experience with its larger screen. The TV is still a one-to-many entertainment device.<query> what is the primary function of a smartphone</query> And the PC is still the best machine for writing reports, developing Powerpoint presentations, and other work-related tasks. In the case of set-top boxes, that primary purpose is delivering premium content in a way that is secure, acceptable to content owners (e.g. HBO and Showtime) and seamless to viewers. The idea of any one of these devices becoming a “master device” spells compromise for the primary functions of those other devices. Smart devices will complement each other What these devices WILL do is complement each other by allowing intelligent interaction between devices. Today, we already see smartphones and tablets being used as remote controls for TVs. Very soon, we will be able to engage in even more advanced integrated tasks. For example, there have been many times while watching a TV show or movie that I wanted to find out more information about something in real time – perhaps the name of an actor/actress or the location of the scene I’m watching.<query> what is the purpose of smart devices</query> With a tablet next to me on the couch, I can instantly research the relevant information. Even so, I need to type in my search terms on the tablet to get my information. And while today’s smart TVs allow us to access the internet in order to search directly from the TV, this interaction disrupts the show for everyone else. In the future, smart TVs and set-top boxes will have the ability to deliver relevant keywords to a connected tablet / smartphone by hitting a button on the TV remote allowing a user to search. In addition, game shows could allow multiple users at home to play along with contestants, vote for participants, or comment in real time. Using a tablet together with a TV during live sports events could enable a user to control different camera views, have user controlled instant replay, or bring up live individual or team statistics, all without disrupting what is being displayed on the TV.<query> what is the future of smart tv</query> Convergence with a caveat I believe that convergence will indeed occur among devices, but it will be a kind offunctional, not device convergence. We will continue to have separate devices, but they will speak and interact with each other much more seamlessly. Each device will have a lot of similar functionality, but will retain the primary functions at which they excel. Until we have the technology to deliver weeks of battery life on a device that will fit in my pocket and deliver a 60” HDTV experience when I’m home, I see each of these devices being part of our lives. It’s a convergence of functionality, but with a caveat. Tags: Android, convergence, Digital Home, mobile, Smart TV Posted in Uncategorized | 2 Comments » It’s an Android Ice Cream Sandwich Tablet, and it’s MIPS!<query> what is convergence</query> December 9th, 2011 by Robert Bismuth Something has changed in the Android world. The first example of a platform/form factor available with the latest release of Android is not an ARM-based platform. It’s MIPS-Based, and it really is the world’s first available Android 4.0 tablet, with full Ice Cream Sandwich functionality and great performance/features –all for less than $100. If you haven’t seen it yet,check out the video on YouTube. How did this happen? Of course, it really didn’t happen overnight. It is also only the first of a series of upcoming advantages that MIPS-Based solutions will give Android users. Legendary performance, great power management and affordable licensing terms combine to yield an extremely desirable, affordable solution for end users. This of course fits perfectly with Google’s intentions for Android.<query> what is the first tablet to have mips</query> From the very first, Google created Android for portability across hardware architectures. Initially some people began to think that Android was a single architecture platform simply because of application processor choices made by mobile handset OEMs that were based on their existing designs. Andy Rubin reminded the world of Android’s neutrality when he blogged about hisGene Amdahl moment back in April 2011. MIPS Technologies has worked with the Android sources since the operating systems’ early days, and has made reference ports available of all the major, applicable Android releases. We recognized early on the potential for Android to move beyond mobile phones and into all corners of consumer electronics – including DTVs and set-top boxes, areas where MIPS is already the leading architecture. Across these areas and others, many MIPS licensees have adopted Android to provide a definitive advantage for their customers.<query> why was android created</query> And now comes Android 4.0 – Ice Cream Sandwich – available on the MIPS architecture. Android 4.0 is significant for both users and new adopters of Android. With this release, Google has improved the user interface based on feedback from Android users. New features have been added to the platform and existing features have become more polished and efficient. However, the single biggest step forward for MIPS’ licensees comes in terms of the basic requirements for Google’s definition of an Android Compatible Device. No longer do devices need to have all the attributes of a mobile device, phone or tablet. In other words, you don’t need a touch screen to be Android Compatible. All you need are a display and an input device that provides the relevant service inside the Android system. This is very important for Google as it expands the Android universe of device types.<query> what is the android 4.0</query> Many of MIPS licensees are well positioned to take advantage of this step forward since they already build SoCs for DTVs, set-top boxes and other digital home products. Now their OEMs will be able to more quickly achieve Android Compatible Device status by starting with Android 4.0 running on MIPS. What could be better than that? We chose to launch Android 4.0 on MIPS in the mobile space not just because we could, but because it illustrates the flexible nature of the MIPS architecture. The MIPS architecture powers not only a wide variety of low power products such as mobile handsets, tablets, portable media devices and ebooks, but it also scales to extremely high performance, powering some of the fastest network infrastructure processors – the devices that in aggregate compose the very backbone of the world’s network infrastructure. We have cores in our current offering and future roadmap that address a broad range of application spaces.<query> what is mips</query> And we have the ecosystem and technologies to support those applications, including support for symmetric multiprocessing, multithreading and 64 bit capabilities. Android on MIPS is a natural fit. It leverages our substantial legacy as a leading RISC architecture – the architecture that is taught around the world as the fundamental RISC architecture. It provides our licensees’ OEMs with a competitive software environment that end users are choosing as their preferred system environment. On top of that, like Android, MIPS is the economical choice with it comes to price/performance. We broke new ground this month by enabling Ingenic and its OEM Ainol to become the first to market with an Android 4.0 tablet. We will continue to break new ground. We always have. That’s what we do. Bottom line: it’s MIPS. Andy Rubin of Google said it best in our press release: “I’m thrilled to see the entrance of MIPS-Based Android 4.0 tablets into the market.<query> what is mips</query> Low cost, high performance tablets are a big win for mobile consumers and a strong illustration of how Android’s openness drives innovation and competition for the benefit of consumers around the world.” Tags: Android, Ice Cream Sandwich Posted in Uncategorized | 5 Comments » Ice Cream Sandwich – Google’s Next Android Delicacy – Coming Soon to MIPS! November 9th, 2011 by Robert Bismuth Android has really fired up everyone’s appetite in the consumer electronics market: Cupcake, Donut, Éclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, and now, Ice Cream Sandwich – the latest delight from the Patisserie Chez Google. Starting with the earliest Android releases on up through the Honeycomb release this past spring, all versions of Android have shipped on MIPS-based consumer electronics platforms. The latest version about to be released by Google is Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).<query> when is google ice cream sandwich coming to mips</query> Community Blog Blog RSS Facebook LinkedIn Newsroom RSS Twitter YouTube Developer Android Web Browsing Performance Greatly Enhanced by Multi-Core and Multi-Threading Technologies February 8th, 2012 by Eyal Barzilay MIPS’ MT technology boosts performance 43 percent; combined MT & MC boosts performance 150 percent By Eyal Barzilay, Applications and Benchmarking Manager The use of multi-core technology to deliver more CPU horsepower is one of the increasingly common methods to providing higher system performance in hardware. This is true even for high volume consumer applications where cost and power can be very important. However, upgrading to a multi-core system doesn’t automatically guarantee performance improvements or an enhanced user experience. It’s not just a hardware problem – software must be written in a way that can make use of parallel hardware resources.<query> what is multicore technology</query> Once Google releases the sources, MIPS and our licensees will quickly have ports ready for OEM platforms. The whole industry is anxiously awaiting the open source release of Ice Cream Sandwich. When Google announced the ICS lead device back in October, some people mistakenly thought that ICS had been released. It had not been released at that time, and still has not been released by Google. This situation is no different than the announcement/release process for all prior Android releases. Google has always followed the same process when releasing Android: Each major version of Android is developed in the context of a lead platform for that version. The lead platform device is announced and demonstrated at some date in advance of the official release of the new version of Android. At some point following the announcement of the lead platform, the new version of Android is released and sources become available for porting.<query> when was ics released</query> For ICS, steps 1 and 2 have now been completed. Step 3 has not yet been completed and until it happens, no OEM, silicon vendor or processor architecture company has access to the ICS sources. Even when step 3 occurs, only the lead platform device is ready to be shipped at that moment in time, since a port of Android for that specific device alone was done by Google during its development process. MIPS and the rest of the market will only get access to ICS when step 3 happens – whenever Google sets the date. When it does happen, MIPS’ software engineers will immediately dig into the ICS sources and quickly produce a MIPS reference port and tool chain for use by our licensees, their OEM customers and app developers. Given our extensive experience porting previous versions of Android, we do not anticipate this will take our engineers very long.<query> when does microsoft ics port start</query> Of course, we will post updates here and on our developer website,http://developer.mips.com. ICS is an evolutionary development of Android and clearly builds on the strengths of Honeycomb. We ported Honeycomb to the MIPS architecture early on and have continually refined that port over the course of this year. That experience will clearly accelerate the port of ICS to the MIPS architecture. MIPS is ready and waiting to bring Ice Cream Sandwich onto our architecture and into the hands of our licensees, their OEM customers and application developers!

So with Intel out of the smart TV picture, what does this mean for the industry?<query> what is ics</query> Who is the processor winner? According toa recent article on VentureBeat, “A potential winner here is Mips, which has been designing chips for Android-based smart TVs.” Thanks for the nod, Dean Takahashi! We agree. I read in a news article that Intel claims it “…led the creation and launch of the smart TV category and its first products.” This is quite a stretch! With its Atom-based CE4100 and CE4200 SoCs targeted at the digital home, Intel’s few major design wins, including the unsuccessful first generation of Google TV, were not for DTV per se. They were in reality over-the-top (OTT) IP set-top boxes—not connected DTV platforms. Even the Sony TV that was at the heart of the Google TV effort used a MIPS-Based SoC for the DTV functionality, with an Intel-based Google TV board connected to it.<query> who is the processor winner</query> Why? Ultimately, Intel is limited by the size and power consumption of its architecture. Across the DTV category, MIPS Technologies provides the number one processor architecture. This includes DTVs, set-top boxes, Blu-ray players and more. If we look at DTV in particular, MIPS licensees are shipping more units than any of our competitors into this market, with MIPS processors shipping inside of DTVs from LG, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, Vizio and other major brands. Shipments of DTVs in the overall market are experiencing a relatively weak period right now, but the potential for the future is huge as home entertainment technologies proliferate into geographies where they were never before possible, and as smart TVs begin to gain a toehold. According to a recent report from IHS iSuppli, “During the next four years, DTV broadcast switchovers will occur in emerging regions such as Latin America, China and Asia-Paciﬁc.” IHS iSuppli forecasts that the worldwide DTV market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent from 2010 to 2015, with annual shipments expected to reach 245.9 million units in 2015.<query> what is the dtv processor</query> The firm goes on to point out that “In the wake of the TV market transition to digital comes the age of the ‘smart’ TV, with all major TV original equipment manufacturers offering new features and functionality via Internet connectivity to TV sets. IHS expects a transition to occur from digital to smart in order to offer similar opportunities to the TV semiconductor supply chain, just as digital has in the recent past.” And while ‘smart’ DTV today represents only the ultra high-end of the DTV market, as the digital home processor leader, MIPS has been laying the groundwork for MIPS-Based smart connected entertainment for several years. Through our ‘Android on MIPS’ initiative, MIPS and our licensees announced the world’s first Android set-top boxes, and there are MIPS-Based Android TVs already shipping in the market.<query> what is mips</query> MIPS is also positioned very well to support Google TV if future generations of this platform experience success. According to Google, Google TV will be based on Android 3.1 (also known as “Honeycomb”). MIPS already has Android Honeycomb running on several SoC devices and we will soon announce the shipment of end products. With that in mind, our licensees can easily support Google TV if they feel that the demand is there. So clearly MIPS is in a strong position regardless of Intel’s decision to remain in this market or leave it. But as most of you know, MIPS and Intel are not the only processor games in town. How will MIPS win against other processor vendors targeting the digital home market, and DTV in particular? As the incumbent in the digital home, we are starting from a position of strength.<query> what processor is intel</query> And as we have pointed out before, the MIPS architecture is more performance-efficient than the competition. This is particularly important in the DTV market where shrinking margins demand the highest possible performance at the lowest possible cost. With MIPS, our licensees get the best combination of performance, price and power. In addition, with the growing applications ecosystem around MIPS for mobile and smart digital home, we are well positioned to provide the solutions our customers need when smart TV moves from the ultra high-end into the mainstream.

August 1st, 2011 by Rao Gattupalli Important factors to consider when choosing an embedded processor for a new project or for a follow-on/upgrade to an existing project include: The highest performing processor for a given die size and power profile Robust roadmap from the vendor and the choice of architectures in the processor family that facilitate optimal programming paradigms for a given application Software tools, applications and SoC partner ecosystem for the processor family Scalability of application performance for software investment protection Ease of adoption on a new project or ease of migration for an upgrade to an existing project Software investment is the biggest ticket item in any project.<query> what is mips</query> Hence it is important to choose an instruction set architecture (ISA) that offers a truly scalable solution for future development. To address various embedded market segments, our distinct, binary-compatible families of processor cores span applications from 32-bit microcontrollers all the way to 64-bit multi-threaded, superscalar many-core processors for networking infrastructure, and numerous digital consumer markets in between. Since one can seamlessly scale the performance range between a wide array of processors, the MIPS architecture offers an ideal path for protecting software investment on a new design or a follow-on/upgrade to an existing project. MIPS Technologies provides the most performance efficient cores for embedded designs, with the highest performance for a given die size and power profile. MIPS’ superscalar cores are ideal for a single-threaded programming model and our multi-threaded cores facilitate both coarse grain parallelism, with virtual processing elements (VPEs) and multiple cores, to fine grain parallelism with thread contexts (TCs).<query> what is mips</query> A multi-threaded architecture is the most efficient way to implement applications or functions that are highly parallelizable. The MIPS64 architecture enables applications to take advantage of larger virtual address space that is greater than 4GB. An important factor to note is that MIPS32 and MIPS64 ISAs are binary compatible. The bulk of the effort in the migration to any new ISA is in the low-level initialization software. Our newARM architecture to MIPS and Power architecture to MIPS Migration Guides illustrate the ease of migration and highlight the areas that users need to focus on. The application code itself is typically coded in a high-level language that can be recompiled to the MIPS ISA. MIPS Technologies provides a rich portfolio of software tools that span from SoC bring-up to performance analysis tools for all popular operating systems. These robust software tools enable the user to optimize their application with very little effort.<query> what is mips architecture</query> But software is adapting – systems are getting much more complex, such that multiple processes and threads are running simultaneously in many cases, and applications are being written to take better advantage of multiprocessing hardware trends. With that in mind, we recently used the BrowsingBench™ benchmark from EEMBC to evaluate the performance benefits of MIPS’ multi-core (MC) and multi-threading (MT) technologies. Our objective was to find out how these technologies enhance the user experience of a very popular and very real consumer application – web browsing on the Android™ software platform. BrowsingBench is a credible and widely used tool that is trusted and cited by leading technology companies. It measures web page loading and rendering time for a large set of web pages with diverse content, and it does this in a reliable way which leads to repeatable and meaningful results.<query> what is mt in web browser</query> Several third party software tool vendors offer a variety of development kits with popular operating systems and a rich suite of tools that make migration straightforward. The breadth and the rich features of MIPS Technologies’ product portfolio, coupled with a flexible business model, enable MIPS licensees to create MIPS-Based products that range from 32-bit microcontrollers and energy efficient mobile devices to ‘green’ supercomputers and high-end networking infrastructure products. Tags: 32-bit, 64-bit, architecture, networking, processor Posted in Uncategorized | No Comments » Faster Clock Speed or More Parallelization? That is the Question! July 14th, 2011 by Manuel Uhm Baseband processors for mobile devices typically run at as slow a clock speed as possible in order to minimize power consumption, generally in the order of 250-500MHz.<query> what is the clock speed of a mips</query> However, the latest air interface standards are dramatically increasing throughputs, which is putting pressure on baseband processors to increase their performance, while simultaneously reducing latency. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why. LTE, or Long Term Evolution, is the latest air interface standard and is currently available from operators like Verizon, NTT DoCoMo and Telia Sonera. LTE represents a greater than 50x increase in maximum user data from its 3G predecessor, W-CDMA, in its maximum configuration (of course, we all know that theoretical maximum data rates are never achieved, nevertheless, the point is still valid). Due to the real time nature of baseband data, this huge increase in data must still be processed in real time. So the only way for a baseband system to compensate for the increased throughput is to significantly decrease latency.<query> what is lte</query> For this reason, the Time Transmission Interval (TTI) for LTE is a mere 1ms, compared to 10ms for W-CDMA. TTI is essentially the length of time to transmit a block of data. Bottom line, the need to process and transmit more than an order-of-magnitude increase in data is creating significant performance demands on cellular baseband processors. This is also true of the next generation WiFi standard, 802.11ac, which promises 1Gbps of data. Typically, performance increases in both the user and control plane come from increasing the clock frequency of the processor. Of course, this is counter-productive to power consumption, which is why this is generally not favored in the first place. Hence, another alternative is to go multi-core, which is a common means of distributing the processing load to achieve higher performance without having to greatly increase the clock frequency.<query> what is tti</query> While this does increase static power consumption due to the increase in transistor count, it is less significant than the increased dynamic power consumption associated with doubling the clock frequency. Multi-core also has the downside of the potential additional licensing and royalties of the 2nd core, as well as the increased manufacturing cost from the greater die size. Fortunately, these are not the only possibilities. Another possibility is to use hardware multi-threading, which can made a processor core look like two cores, each of which could run an independent OS or RTOS. In this case, the processing load is distributed across what appears to the RTOS to be two cores. In the MIPS32® 34K® core, these are known as VPEs, or Virtual Processing Elements. With a multi-threaded core, the increase in die size is relatively small and there is no need to pay a license fee or royalties for a second core.<query> what is multithread processor</query> Furthermore, latency can be significantly decreased since threads can be parked and revived with a zero overhead context switch, hence achieving the two main technical requirements. One of our baseband customers simulated its multi-mode modem and found that with MIPS multi-threading, processor stalls were reduced by over 20%! All of this leads to an improved mobile device user experience, as responsiveness is greatly increased. The biggest downside to usage of hardware multi-threading is some increase of software complexity, and porting of legacy software. Software which runs single-threaded must be re-architected in order to fully exploit the benefits of multi-threading. While this is not a complete re-write, it can be substantial. Of course, the same is also true of multi-core, so software which supports multi-threading is an inevitability.<query> what is the benefit of multithreading</query> So regardless, this needs to be done. The exact level of effort depends largely on how well the code is structured (the more modular, the better), written, and documented. For a multi-mode modem, the code can be partitioned in a few different ways to exploit multi-threading while minimizing the porting cost. Stay tuned for my next post to learn more! So the answer to the question above is, of course, it depends. It depends on the application requirements, particularly the power threshold. But for mobile baseband processors, clearly multi-threading provides a solution that increases performance significantly in a much more power friendly manner than doubling the clock speed or going multi-core.

Posted in Uncategorized | 1 Comment » Nice Try, No Cigar June 16th, 2011 by Ian Anderton Yesterday Freescale announced that its Kinetis microcontroller achieves the highest CoreMark/MHz score of any Cortex-M class device.<query> what is multithreading</query> Whilst this announcement is an opportunity to bring out the bunting and set off a few fireworks in Austin, this news was met in Sunnyvale with a ‘Nice try, no cigar’. 2.119 CoreMark/MHz may be a credible result for a Cortex-M class microcontroller, but it falls well short of what an equivalent MIPS processor core can achieve. The MIPS32 M14K and M4K families of processor cores target similar market applications as Cortex-M. As I have detailed in the‘Beyond the Hype’ white paper and a previous blog post, the M14K and M4K cores, based on the standard MIPS architecture, have a higher operating performance than the Cortex-M series, in addition to having superior features, smaller area and lower power. So, how much better performance? Let’s take a look at some numbers.<query> what is the coremark of a mips processor</query> The M14K core operating in microMIPS mode (the 32-/16-bit code compression-enabled ISA) achieves a 2.56 CoreMark/MHz score—20% higher performance than Kinetis. The PIC32 MCU family from Microchip (based on the M4K core) achieves a 2.51 CoreMark/MHz score, an 18% increase in performance relative to Kinetis operating at the same clock frequency. Why do MIPS processors outperform their equivalent ARM counterparts across the complete product range? Well, Watson, it all comes down to MIPS having a better, more efficient architecture – something it is well known for. Comparing MIPS and ARM architectures highlights some interesting facts on how MIPS is able to achieve better performance and higher frequencies. MIPS has: • 32 general purpose registers (ARM only has 16) • Mostly single-operation instructions (with ARM, many operations require multiple instructions to complete) • Less predicated execution than ARM • Simpler memory addressing modes, and fewer executing modes than ARM • Shadow register sets (ARM does not have these) ….and so on.<query> what is the difference between a mips and an arm</query> For more information about these attributes, check out the whitepaperhere. Other MIPS cores also make use of a unique multi-threading capability, which further increases efficiency compared to ARM cores. In addition, the M14K and M4K processor cores are designed with a 5-stage pipeline execution unit; Cortex-M cores implement only a 3-stage pipeline architecture. This is another key feature which contributes to MIPS’ high performance. Running the Dhrystone benchmark results in M14K (in microMIPS mode) producing 1.48 DMIPS/MHz, while Cortex-M3 (and the M4 implemented in the Freescale Kinetis device) only achieves a max 1.25 DMIPS/MHz. Now, back to EEMBC CoreMark, where we started this discussion… CoreMark is an interesting and useful benchmark because it is aimed at benchmarking the performance of the processor core specifically.<query> what is the performance of a mips core</query> CoreMark analyzes and scores the processor pipeline structure and efficiency, performing three main tasks that test its execution of commonly used operations. Importantly, the CoreMark test is written such that it isolates the processor from memory influences. CoreMark is quickly becoming an industry standard benchmark for measuring and comparing processor performance. The higher the CoreMark number, the higher the performance. Pass me the box of cigars please.

We ran BrowsingBench on a system based on the MIPS32® 1004K™ Coherent Processing System (CPS). In its maximum implementation, the 1004K CPS can support up to four cores and two hardware threads (also known as Virtual Processing Elements or VPEs) per core. To keep things simple for this test however, the configuration we used was dual core with two VPEs per core, for a total of 4 VPEs. VPEs are essentially logical CPUs that share one physical pipeline in each 1004K core, based on MIPS’ multi-threading technology.<query> what is the cps of mips</query> MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM Convergence with a Caveat: Will the TV, tablet, smartphone and computer converge into one master device?

To evaluate the benefits of multiple cores and VPEs on web browser performance, we ran BrowsingBench using the 4 different configurations listed in the table below. In all cases, the tests were executed on the same dual-core 1004K system; however we used the operating system to enable and disable cores and VPEs. The big question we wanted to answer was whether Android would be able to take advantage of these multiple processing resources to load and render web pages faster, thereby enhancing the user experience. To do that, Android would have to use parallel processes and threads while executing the browsing workload. The results, which are shown in the table and chart below, leave no doubt: Android based web browsing performance is greatly enhanced by MC and MT technologies.<query> what is the difference between mc and vpe</query> The main observation is that browsing performance improves more than 2.5x when comparing the full configuration to the basic configuration. With a great deal of parallel execution under Android, the browser can truly benefit from the combination of MT and MC. A closer look at what’s happening under the hood in the Android system indeed shows that a lot of processes are running in parallel. The two main processes in the system are the Android Browser itself and another process called “system server,” which manages many components of Android including the display system, and is kept very busy during the BrowsingBench run. Even if we limit the system to a single core, the MIPS MT technology gives us a BrowsingBench performance boost of 43 percent. One of the primary attributes of MT is to improve performance efficiency of a core, which it does by increasing the pipeline utilization of that core when multiple processes and/or threads are running.<query> what is mt in android</query> So for systems where silicon real estate is at a premium, choosing a multithreaded core can be a great way to boost system performance. When multi-core and multi-threading systems were first introduced into the marketplace, most existing software was not optimized to make good use of these technologies. Today this is changing. Android is a complex software platform, and a perfect example of a high volume consumer platform that is quickly evolving and being optimized for optimal user experience in a Web-connected world. At MIPS we are very pleased with the benchmark results because they demonstrate that our MC and MT technologies deliver much higher performance than the standard hardware used only a few years ago, and make a significant impact to end users of many connected devices from smart phones and tablets to connected DTVs.

Firstly, given my previous comments about O2 and the upgrade issue… I should explain why I bothered. I got the 3.0 upgrade on the 3G when it came out last Wednesday, and liked what I found, particularly the option to install more than the 2.0 OS limit of 144 / 9 pages of apps.<query> what operating system does the iphone 3gs use</query> It’s now effectively unlimited, since even if you don’t have space on a home screen, you can search for the app using Spotlight. That’s nice. However, I was already hitting my space limit on the 16Gb 3G, so room to breathe was going to be handy. I also liked the improved navigation and possibility to getthe TomTom kit in the future, and once I’d tried the camera in-store, I thought that was going to be a big deal as well (more on that, below). There was a small amount of peer pressure too, given ourconversation on last week’s Dogear Nation. In the end I opted to get a PAYG phone, swap in my contract SIM, and sell the old handset toMazuma. If I’d waited to upgrade and then wanted the same handset I now have, I’d've ended up on another 18 (or 24) month contract with the same upgrade trap in June, and probably on a higher tariff to subsidise the cost of a new handset.<query> what is the space limit for tomtom</query> This way my existing contract will run out in due course, I stay on the same tariff, and the handset doesn’t cost much more than it would have done come “upgrade” time in 3-6 months. So what’s good? It’s very clearly nippier. Every operation is obviously faster and cleaner. I’m liking the camera and video recording (zoom would be nice, but variable focus and auto-adjusting exposure/white balance work for me). It was a great move to retain the 3G body and form factor – myClarifi case still fits perfectly, and the macro lens seems to let me focus marginally closer still than the 3GS can manage on its own (it does a good job by itself, though). Amongst the sprinkling of other functions I like, not specific to the new model, are the landscape keyboard and the improved podcast playback features – did you know you can slide horizontally to scrub through a track, and slide down to scrub more finely?<query> what is the new myclarifi 3gs</query> Neat. The real revelation so far though, has been the screen. The new smudge / grease-resistant coating is a marvel. So far I’ve not fitted a screen protector, and although I’m loath to allow it to become physically scratched, the new screen feels and looks so much better and remains much, much cleaner. It’s just… almost magic. In the “miss” column we have the voice control feature, which I’m not sure I’ll be using much; and shake-to-shuffle (is this actually supposed to work if the display is locked, by the way? seems not to do so for me, which makes it even more pointless). Oh, and battery life seems worse, but I suspect the compass and the notifications feature are contributing to that, as are the wider range of ways I’m actually using it.<query> does shake to shuffle work on a pc</query> May have to think about aMophie Juice Pack Air. I used the video function in anger for the first time today, uploading one clip from the Hursley Tri-Department sports tournamentdirectly to YouTube, and later grabbed a set of clips from the phone via iPhoto (yes, iPhoto manages video from the iPhone, go figure) and edited them together in iMovie. It’s not the best quality but probably still as good as my cheap USB camcorder – plus the screen and on-device editing features are nice additions. Rumours arethat the chipset is capable of 720p video, but I doubt we’ll get to see that in the current generation of device. I’ve posteda bunch of sample photos to Flickr as well, if you are interested – theBlue Eyeball shot was taken at close quarters with the Clarifi. Really nothing more to say here.<query> what is the best iphone camera for video</query> There are more than enough people getting excited about the device and as I said, I hadn’t planned to write up any thoughts – blamethat Danish guy [1] just because I responded to audience pressure this time, don’t expect me to do it every time, m’kay? → 11 Comments Posted in 24924 Tagged Apple, gadget, iphone, iphone 3gs, O2, Photography, review, video The Great Address Book Cleanup Posted on May 20, 2009 | 6 Comments This was fairly tedious, so I thought I’d share it with you, my loyal blog readers Over time, my address book has become unmanageable. Until today, what I had managed to achieve was a curious fusion of useful family postal address data, mostly from the pre-social network, pre-email, pre-mobile days of 10-15 years ago when I had loaded it all into Evolution on Linux; several personal and work mobile phone SIMs worth of numbers in various formats, covering probably a 10 year period judging from the names and numbers in there; and lots and lots of email addresses, covering a similar period, but recently bloated by the habits of Gmail and Apple Mail of storing some data automagically.<query> what is the address book on an iphone</query> In short: a total mess. I had multiple entries for several of my close friends and family; original home addresses of university friends I have not been in contact with for 12 years (!); and outdated information for many other folks. The iPhone was really the final catalyst for sorting all of this out. More than once recently, I’ve tried to find a number for a friend, and had several entries for that person, several of which were out of date. I’ve called a good friend’s brother on a phone he gave him more than seven years ago, twice in the past 6 months. That’s how useless I’ve become at managing this stuff. Since the iPhone was core to the issue, and since it syncs with the Address Book, I decided to use that as my core tool for fixing the problem.<query> why is my address book out of date</query> Here’s more-or-less what I ended up doing: Cleaned up multiple entries in Address Book, merging into a single entry for any one contact, including work and personal data, and adding company names where possible. Deleted redundant entries such as the university addresses which I knew were going to be wrong. Read through the various hints on this page for information on how I could get contact data from LinkedIn and Facebook and elsewhere… Exported my LinkedIn Contacts as a .vcf file for import into Address Book… imported and checked the merge information. Grabbed my Facebook Contacts phone details using a Greasemonkey script and a tool called AddressBooker (see the above linked hints page for details). At this point I had an issue. Downloading from AddressBooker as .vcf caused all the names to be exported as just FirstName fields, so when I tried to merge into Address Book everyone came up as a “new” contact.<query> can you import linkedin contacts into address book</query> A better solution turned out to be to import directly from AddressBooker into Google Mail Contacts first; do any data merging and cleanup there (GMail Contacts has a nice “merge contacts” capability if you have multiple entries for one person); and then export as .vcf, and import into Address Book, checking the merge information as before with LinkedIn. Sounds long-winded, but it would have taken longer to manage manually in Address Book. At this point, Apple Address Book contained my “authoritative” contact list. To get it back into GMail, I scrubbed my whole GMail contacts list (slightly scary, but necessary), and then played around withthe Automator action described in the Maciverse tips page, trying to use Numbers instead of Excel. Ultimately that was a disaster as it just couldn’t encode the tab-separated to CSV files correctly.<query> can you merge contacts from address book into gmail</query> The final answer turned out to be a brilliant little (free / donationware) utility calledA to G. Get it. Use it. Donate. Result! And next time, I’ll try not to let this get so out of hand… I see another wrinkle in this whole space. Although tools like Google Voice tend towards centralising all your contact details behind a single number you control (great idea – dear Google, when can we get it in Europe? hint hint!), the proliferation of social networks means that we all have multiple profiles and IDs. In particular, I find Skype and Twitter addresses hugely useful. Apple’s Address Book, of course, doesn’t provide “official” spots for those… there’s no entry for Skype in the IM drop-down list, and no space for arbitrary URLs, you have to edit and maintain a list of them.<query> what is skype and twitter</query> It has never seen a fresh install of the OS since it shipped (with OS X Tiger 10.4) – instead, it has been upgraded through Leopard andSnow Leopard (which I really liked on its debut). Over time though, it has become less central to my computing experience. I moved from Windows to Ubuntu on my day-to-day work machine, and my computing life fragmented to include a netbook, smartphones, and most recently a tablet (which is yet another of those things I keep meaning to write about!). Main use cases for the Mac continue to be Keynote – by far the best presentation software available on any platform, in my opinion; Lightroom and iMovie; and iTunes, which is firmly embedded in my life as a sync source for my iPhone and for organising my music library.<query> what is the mac used for</query> Something more extensible and easy to keep in sync would be very useful. Update: the broken part Google Talk appears now to have completely lost my contact list. Gah. So if you were connected to me on Gtalk then you may need to reconnect, or you may get a new connection request from me.

For those not obsessed with Twitter or their follower numbers, there’s an application you probably haven’t heard of called TwitterCounter.<query> what is twitter counter</query> The site provides tools, graphs and APIs for charting the growth of a user’s Twitter followers. It’s interesting, and if you’re slightly obsessive about figures and have a belief that such things “matter”, then you might already spend time checking it and looking at the pretty graphs. It also provides an element of “prediction” based on historical growth trends, and does cool things like allowing users to compare themselves to others and watch the graphs intersect or overlap. There’s just one issue – although it looks great on the desktop, the site isn’t laid out very well for mobile browsers like Mobile Safari on the iPhone. It also uses a Flash component to display the graph, and since there’s currently no Flash on the iPhone, you get a big blank box in the middle of the screen. The nice part is that TwitterCounter has a simple REST API which enables a developer to get the raw data about a user’s follower numbers.<query> what is twitter counter</query> If you use Twitter clients likeTweetdeck, then you’ll see this in action. Based on my previous experience of using the iWebkit framework to build an iPhone-optimised web wrapper for the data from my Current Cost meter, I thought it might be interesting to play around with using iWebkit to display the TwitterCounter stats. iWebkit is a simple HTML framework which provides a set of CSS classes to make your web pages look like native iPhone apps. There are other frameworks out there like iUI and webapp.net, but they depend a lot more on knowledge of AJAX and some more advanced / dynamic coding, whereas iWebkit is all about simplicity – if you know your HTML basics, it is pretty straightforward. As it happens, you can extend it very easily as well – in my case, I combined it with some PHP functions which call out to TwitterCounter and echo the numbers into a table on a web page.<query> what is iwebkit</query> Although I worked with PHP a lot a few years ago, I hadn’t really done much with the language recently. The first thing I did was to create a simple piece of code to call the TwitterCounter API and get back the data for a specific user; and then I displayed it in a web page. Once I’d done that, it was pretty easy to get the whole thing wrapped into two pages of iWebkit template code, and style it all appropriately. Revision one of the interface and app ran off my home server, and didn’t look fantastic. My initial thought for a name was “TwitterCounter nano”, but I changed it after realising that it didn’t fit so well as a name on the iPhone home screen In the screenshot on the left, you’ll also see that the first form I came up with was far from “iPhone native-looking”… the current version of iWebkit didn’t have form CSS classes, so I had to tweak things a little.<query> what is twittercounter nano</query> I also found it was worth digging into theApple Web Development Guidelines for the iPhone, which gave some hints about how to make some iPhone-specific tweaks like turning off auto-capitalisation for the text entry box (since most usernames are all in lowercase), and how to add a text hint, for example. So, the second iteration of the UI looks a lot nicer. It’s also possible to hit the bookmark button in Safari and add the app as a shortcut on the iPhone home screen… (see the icon at the top of the post)… if you do that, and launch TwtrCtr from there, it will act as a full-screen iPhone app with no Safari controls, giving a much more native experience. The user can then navigate by using the controls in the header bar rather than the forward and back buttons provided by the browser.<query> can you add a bookmark to safari</query> I added an FAQ page, too, so if you want to know more about the app you can check that out directly on the site. In these days of heightened concern about Twitter security I also thought it would be a good idea to add a note on the front screen to point out that it doesn’t ask for anything more than a username, and it doesn’t log that anywhere, it just passes it on to the TwitterCounter API. OK, that was a rather long explanation of the evolution of the first page! The important part is actually how the data is displayed. Once you’ve entered a valid Twitter username and hit “Get User Stats”, you get a single-page representation of the TwitterCounter data for the given user. The top 2 or three rows are links which will open the user’s profile page, homepage/URL (if one is set… otherwise that row doesn’t display), or display a simple graph / chart which is generated by theGoogle Chart API.<query> how to get twitter stats</query> The latter is something high on my list of enhancements, because it looks a little dull at the moment; also, I’m generating the Google Charts URL myself rather than using one of the PHP wrappers to the API, which would probably be a lot simpler. Don’t look too closely for the rough edges… right now, it doesn’t actually make any effort deal with cases where a user doesn’t exist, or TwitterCounter or Twitter is down…. I know about those small issues In a nutshell, then – that’s all it is. A mashup which allowed me to explore a bit more iPhone-specific web development, some PHP / REST / XML coding, and a bit of Google Charts stuff as well. I have to say that the TwitterCounter folks (Boris and Arjen in particular) have been brilliant and very helpful and supportive, despite their app having an issue with the Twitter API while I was in the middle of developing this mashup on top of their API!<query> what is twittercounter</query> iWebkit is a lot of fun to play with, and very simple as well – I know the developers are working hard to add new features into that framework whilst keeping it simple and aiming it at “non-techies”. Oh, and incidentally, although the stylesheets make it look like an iPhone app, it should work perfectly well in any desktop or mobile browser – it’s plain old HTML. I’m not making any claims about how this might develop in the future, but I’ve got a couple of ideas for tweaks that I might make. In the meantime, if you’re an iPhone (or other mobile device) Twitter user, do take a look athttp://andypiper.tv/twtrctr and see how it works for you.

I previously owned a 2nd generation nano, and loved it. Light, easy to use… OK the screen was tiny and the capacity was limited, but it did the job. The iPhone has that nice big screen with video playback going for it, and now it also has the new (and very, very cool) Genius playlist feature.<query> what is the best iphone ever made</query> Just a small number of issues, then… No search? the 2G nano had search! Am I missing something? No ability to read the notes for podcasts. On the nano I could press the button to cycle through time / cover art / lyrics or info display, and on the iPhone I get lyrics or the “back” of the album cover. Nothing useful for podcasts. The time slider is way too difficult to control with a finger. On a longer podcast, say over an hour, skipping over a minute or two of the duration is almost impossible. The click wheel definitely wins there. Finally, and most annoyingly: no external skip / pause control. I have to take the phone out of my pocket, potentially unlock the screen, and then skip to the next track.<query> what is the nano</query> Even thoughthe iTunes data itself was migrated off the now-comparatively-weedy 120Gb internal drive a couple of years ago, I’ve continued to struggle for a comfortable amount of available disk space, but I still use the Mac for all of those things and I can’t really think of a viable alternative, despite the cloudification of many of the other services I use and their associated data. Pros and Cons When Lion was announced and the features previewed last year, I really struggled to see anything compelling in the release. It was clear that it was the iOSification of the desktop OS. The early views of Mission Control looked cluttered and bloated (combine Dashboard, Spaces, and Expose? surely a mess?). I wasn’t a fan of the idea of the Launchpad, I didn’t have a multitouch trackpad, I like to be able to switch and recompose app windows on a GUI and not run things full-screen.<query> what is the pros and cons of lion</query> Really not the best idea when travelling on the London Underground (“that’s right folks, I have a 3G iPhone, please mug me at the next station”). OK – time for a confession here. I never unpacked the iPhone headphones until last week. I didn’t realise that they have a mic on the wire with a click switch which gives the forward/back/pause control. Why? Because I’m so used to the poor audio quality of the Apple earbuds thatI switched to Shure ones several months ago and I’ve been using them since. So it seems to me that what is needed is some kind of cable which can fit in between third-party headphones and the iPhone’s headphone socket with an external switch on them. I think the iPhone is an awesome device, but for me, it just isn’t the best iPod I’ve ever had.<query> do iphone headphones have mic</query> Technorati Tags: iPhone, iPod, Apple, nano, touch, headphones, audio → 11 Comments Posted in 24924 Tagged Apple, audio, headphones, iphone, iPod, nano, touch ← Older posts Contact the author Andy Piper social bridgebuilder |photographer | techie | speaker | podcaster | community lead voice: +44 20 3287 1302 email: compose Follow @andypiper Google Profile More about Andy...

My early 2007 MacBook was just on the cusp of supported hardware for Lion (it scraped in by virtue of the Core 2 Duo processor; I bought a Magic Trackpad a little while ago to take advantage of gestures, although since it’s separate I still haven’t used it a great deal). I already mentioned my continual struggle for space on the hard drive, but knowing that Apple had actually managed to make the OS smaller in previous releases by getting rid of legacy cruft, it seemed like Lion might be worth a shot. I spent the week before the release cleaning things up – removing any remaining Classic apps or PPC apps that relied on the now-defunct Rosetta (very few, mostly old camera drivers which were only included in their respective packages to support older machines at the time they shipped); running OnyX to clean out caches and logs; uninstalling anything I’d not used for a long time; cleaning down Library and Application Support folders associated with software I no longer use.<query> what is the app store for macbook pro</query> Yes, a clean install would have got around this, but on the flipside I would have spent a lot of time putting things back the way they were and reinstalling software. Once I’d done the upgrade I was miffed to discover that the installation package had vanished, but I’m glad thatthe brilliant Don McAllister has found a way to recover it from the Mac App Store for future use! So what do I think? Well, the scrolling thing is interesting. I get the reason that so-called “natural” scrolling has been introduced to unify the touch interfaces across OS X and iOS, and I also realise that while I could switch it off, it’s not going to go away so I may as well get comfortable with the idea. It’s one of those brain-rewiring exercises, similar to the one I’ve been going through learning Unity on Ubuntu, and for the same reason – there’s little point in fighting the future once the decisions are made.<query> why is scrolling on mac</query> Now for two things I didn’t expect to like: Mission Control and full-screen apps. I really, really like them… I’vealways used a large number of Spaces to organise my workspace and I’m finding that Mission Control makes this even more intuitive. I can still quickly zoom out to have an overview and move things around, and if I’m using the Magic Trackpad the swiping to switch apps and spaces is nice too. There are a few apps that need work on their full-screen modes, notably Chrome, but that will come in time. I’m not bothered by iCal or Address Book having strange faux-”natural” new looks, since I’ve migrated almost all of my use of those apps to Google anyway, for maximum interoperability across devices and platforms. On the rest of the visual aspects, I’m not sure I like the “zoom/pop” dialog boxes yet.<query> what apps need to be on full screen</query> The more rectangular buttons do seem more serious and polished than the older Aqua lozenge style, but it’s a shame to see a much more grey overall feeling across the UI. Java is gone, as Apple said it would be, but the procedure to get it back was very smooth and simple, typing “java” in a command window started an Apple Update installation, with within a few moments it was all done. A couple of little niggles with some other apps. I also found myself resetting my Dock (which I’d been running in 2D with various folders docked as Stacks) to its default state by clearing down the associated .plist files and restarting it, to get it back to the way Lion comes out of the box / download. The future I mentioned a tablet and a variety of other lightweight devices, but I can’t see myself abandoning the PC device (in this case a laptop of some kind) just yet.<query> what is the default dock in lion</query> As I mentioned in the discussion of scrolling, I’m firmly of the opinion that we need to adapt to new ways of interacting with technology, and I’ve got a range of devices to play with right now. However, I haven’t yet found a replacement for the keyboard / graphical desktop / pointing device combination that is as effective forcreating content as a PC (be that Mac, Windows or Linux, with keyboard and mouse/trackpad/pointer). I can type quickly on a touchscreen smartphone or tablet now, but it’s still not as comfortable for creating text and laying out images as a graphical computer desktop of some kind. I can perform simple and basic image or video edits on a mobile device, but again for anything more extensive I find myself wanting to see more and have finer control than I get with a fat fingertip on a small touchscreen.<query> what is the difference between a keyboard and a pc</query> So all of that leads me to think ahead to a next device… not that I must have one at the moment, but still. I’ve increasingly fallen out of love with Apple over the past year or two as they have behaved in an increasingly anti-competitive manner over Android, the App Store, madesilly restrictions locking out hardware replacement in new iMacs, etc. – but I can’t see myself escaping the ecosystem completely due to the quality of the software I’ve already mentioned, even though I’m not locking myself in to the entire Apple life end-to-end. The new generation of MacBook Airs hit on Wednesday alongside Lion, and I’m reconsidering whether or not that would make an acceptable replacement for an older 15″ MBP. On paper, at the expense of a diagonal 2″ of screen real-estate, I would still get +1Gb RAM, potentially more storage (256Mb flash storage over 120Gb HDD), a CPU that’s clocked slower (1.7GHz vs 2.33GHz) but probably runs faster due to architectural improvements… it’s tempting… if I could be convinced that I’d get the performance I’d like in iMovie and Lightroom, and if I had the cash, then I might make that jump.<query> what is the new generation of macbook airs</query>"

Google Desktop Search, which for now works with Windows XP, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 and above, represents a new front in Microsoft's war for the Web; it was never really about the browser, according to Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. While Microsoft came to dominate the desktop OS market, the rise of the Web threatened it, because people didn't need a specific operating system to access Web content. ""Netscape was not really the competitive threat Microsoft was trying to address [with Internet Explorer],"" Wilcox said. ""By making the browser part of the operating system, if you have the dominant platform, you can extend it to the Web. You're also extending the utility of the operating system and the way it takes in information."" Google's move has again raised the question of whether Windows is required to access the Web.<query> what is google desktop search</query> ""By extending its search platform, Google creates a presence in other browsers and other operating systems, and potentially in new devices that will be increasingly be used to access the Web, such as Wi-Fi-enabled PDAs, cell phones and smart phones,"" Wilcox said. At the same time, Google has invaded Microsoft's prime turf: the desktop. Said John Battelle, author of an upcoming book on search, ""Search has become a de facto interface for the Internet, and I think Google has quite elegantly leveraged that presumption back onto the desktop."" He said Google's clean and simple interface is a better solution to finding all the various files that Microsoft creates. While it's neither an alternative to Windows nor an interface on top of it, he added, ""there's no question that this approach will eat into the amount of quality time a consumer spends with Windows."" But desktop search itself is not such a threat to Redmond, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff.<query> why is google desktop search better than windows</query> Microsoft certainly knew Google was working on this, and MSN is working on a similar tool, with Lookout as the basis. In July, Microsoft bought Lookout, a third-party developer's ""personal search tool"" that lets users search their desktops from within their Outlook e-mail client. The software was placed under the purview of the MSN Search team, which is working onnew Web search technology. At the same time, another team at Microsoft is building WinFS, a new file system that supposedly will let users search through multiple file types stored on a desktop computer. But Lookout -- and Google Desktop Search -- are very different from WinFS. ""WinFS is a whole different search beast,"" said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. ""You're talking about more than just searching for documents, you're also searching for complex information.<query> what is lookout</query> One of its fundamental aspects is being able to use metadata as a means of not just finding information but also making it more meaningful."" ""MSN is making significant investments in search, and we will ship the product when we are confident it will meet the needs of our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said. The company plans to release betas of the new algorithmic search engine and desktop search in the U.S. by the end of 2004. Rosoff said that WinFS is a non-starter in this battle. Microsoft admitted in August that WinFS would not ship as part of Longhorn, the next Windows version expected in 2006. ""It's not going to be in Longhorn, and I'm not sure when we'll see it,"" he said. ""MSN search will be their answer to Google for the time being."" In fact, he said, Microsoft has always used MSN as a blocking tool, first against AOL and most recently, with thelaunch of MSN Music, against Apple's iTunes music download service.<query> when will msn be available</query> ""MSN has the time and resources, and they will hammer at this idea until they perceive the threat is gone,"" he said. ""The bigger threat from Google is that end users will turn more and more to hosted online services to perform regular functions, rather than using the Windows shell or Microsoft desktop applications,"" Rosoff said. ""The threat [is] from hosted applications versus Microsoft's thick client and desktop operating system. When Google is looking more and more like a thin-client company, that poses threat to Microsoft's core business model."" And it's not like there aren't other alternatives for desktop search, according to Gary Price, author of ""The Invisible Web."" He pointed out that companies like Copernic haveoffered desktop search for years. ""Alta Vista in its raw form is still more powerful than Google,"" he said, adding that Google doesn't index a lot of file formats.<query> what is the threat of google</query> Josh Jacobs, president of search technology provider X1, which powers part of the new Snap personal search tool, said his company's desktop search technology indexes 255 different file types, including MP3 and PDF. X1, which retails for $79.95, is aimed at professionals who understand file types and how to refine searches, while Google Desktop Search, according to Marissa Mayer, Google director of consumer Web products, is aimed at people who aren't sure of where the information they're looking for is located. ""A lot of time users don't even remember where things are,"" she said. ""All they remember is that they saw it."" X1 users, on the other hand, ""focuses on people who use desktop search as a part of the way they do their jobs,"" Jacobs said. ""They're people for whom the information on their computer is the key to business success."" Jacobs said he welcomed the arrival of Google's product, because it would raise awareness of the desktop search category.<query> what is the difference between google desktop search and x1</query> After all, awareness is one of Google's key strengths. Said Price, news editor ofSearch Engine Watch, which, like Jupiter Research, has the same corporate owner asinternetnews.com. ""What's equally impressive about Google is how they've turned something you can't hold in your hands into a verb -- without doing any consumer-facing marketing."" ""A lot of companies besides Google do desktop search,"" Battelle said. ""But none of them are Google. Integrating it into Google's strength, the Web interface, that's what makes it special."" But if the desktop is the new front in the war for the domination of search, the battle has just begun. As Microsoft homes in on the problem via the OS and MSN, rivals Yahoo , AOL , Ask Jeeves and even e-commerce-oriented Amazon are offering their own versions.<query> what is google's strength</query>"

A microphone icon appears at the right end of the iconic search box. If you have a microphone built-in or attached to your computer, clicking that icon creates a direct audio connection to Google's servers, which will convert your spoken words into text. It has been possible to speak Google search queries using a smart phone for almost three years; since last year, Android handsets have been able to take voice input in any situation where a keyboard would normally be used. ""That was transformational, because people stopped worrying about when they could and couldn't speak to the phone,"" says Vincent Vanhoucke , who leads the voice search engineering team at Google. Over the last 12 months, the number of spoken inputs, search or otherwise, via Android devices has climbed six times, and every day, tens of thousands of hours of audio speech are fed into Google's servers.<query> can you speak google search</query> ""On Android, a large fraction of the use is people dictating e-mail and SMS,"" says Vanhoucke. Vanhoucke's team now wants using voice on the Web to be as easy as it is on Android. ""It's a big bet,"" he says. "" Voice search for desktop is the flagship for this, [but] we want to take speech everywhere."" Voice recognition is more technically challenging on a desktop or laptop computer, says Vanhoucke, because it requires noise suppression algorithms that are not needed for mobile speech recognition. These algorithms filter out sounds such as those of a computer's fan or air conditioners. ""The quality of the audio is paramount for phone manufacturers, and you hold it close to your mouth,"" says Vanhoucke. ""On a PC, the microphone is an afterthought, and you are further away.<query> why is voice recognition difficult on a laptop</query> You don't get the best quality."" Google asked thousands of people to read phrases aloud to their computers to gather data on the conditions its speech recognition technology would have to handle. As people use the service for real, it is trained further, says Vanhoucke, which should increase its popularity. Data from users of mobile voice search shows that people are much more likely to use the feature again when it is accurate for them the first time. A bigger challenge to getting users to embrace voice recognition on the desktop could be the existing tools for entering information, says Keith Vertanen , a lecturer at Princeton University who researches voice-recognition technology. ""On the desktop, you're up against a very fast and efficient means of input in the keyboard,"" he says. ""On a phone, you don't have that available, and you are often in hands- or eyes-free situations where voice input really helps."" Vertanen says people are less tolerant of glitches when using speech recognition on a desktop computer because of the close proximity of a tried-and-true way of entering text.<query> why is voice recognition used on desktop</query> He says users might find voice recognition more compelling on on other Internet-connected devices in the home. ""Nonconventional devices like a DVR, television, or game console don't usually have good text input,"" he points out. Google TV devices can already take voice input spoken into a connected Android phone. Vanhoucke acknowledges that speech recognition fulfills a more immediate need on phones, but argues that users are ready for it on conventional computers, too. ""People will use it in ways that surprise us,"" he says. ""At this point, it's still an experiment."" Situations when people may have their hands full is one example, says Vanhoucke (although it should be noted that desktop voice search today still involves using the mouse to activate the feature). Google isn't performing this experiment alone. The company is pushing the Web standards body W3C to introduce a standard set of HTML markup that allows any website or app to call on voice recognition via the Web browser, and has already enabled a version of this markup in the Chrome browser.<query> what devices can voice recognition work on</query> For now, Google is the only major company with a browser able to use the prototype feature, but Mozilla, Microsoft, and AT&T are all working with the W3C effort. ""It's a collaborative effort that other browser makers are part of,"" says Vanhoucke. ""Any designer can add it to their Web page. It's something anyone can use."" Extensions for the Chrome browser that make use of voice input ( like this one ) have already appeared, and can be used to enter text on any website. However, those extensions reveal that although Google's desktop speech recognition is accurate for search queries, it's not much good for tasks like composing e-mail. Enabling the system to learn the personal quirks of each person's pronunciation, a feature already enabled on Android phones, could address that.<query> what browsers use voice input</query> Vertanen points out that the personalization learned through mobile search could easily be ported over to the desktop for people logged into their Google account. It could also make it possible for the technology to spring up elsewhere. ""The advantage of Google's networked approach is that a [speech] model in the cloud can adapt to your voice in all these different places and follow you around, whether that's in your living room or in your car."" A Browser that Speaks Your Language The latest version of Google's Chrome shows the potential of HTML5.

If a student waives the minor requirement in favor of the 12 advanced units, the student must fulfill the advanced course requirement by taking (a) non-core graduate courses required by a particular area,or (b) graduate-level courses in other departments comparable in quality to Psychology's graduate courses.<query> what is the cada</query> If there is any question about comparability, the student should consult the adviser, student services, and, in some cases, the graduate program committee chair before taking the course. Orals—The candidate must pass the University oral examination, which also serves as a dissertation defense. A committee is formed to review the oral examination, including the dissertation reading committee, an additional faculty member, and one oral examination committee chair from outside the Psychology department. The oral examination consists of a 40-45-minute presentation to the department of the completed dissertation research. Parents and friends are welcome to attend. Following the presentation, the student and the committee convene for a discussion of the dissertation and the presentation. Dissertation Requirements—The candidate must complete a dissertation satisfactory to the dissertation reading committee prior to the oral examination. Minor revisions to formatting may be made after the oral examination.<query> how long is the oral examination</query> Ph.D. candidacy expires five years after admission to candidacy at the end of the second year of study. Reapplication requires department reexamination. STUDENT EVALUATIONS First-Year Evaluation—It is the department's policy to evaluate the progress of each graduate student at the end of the first year of graduate study. As part of the procedure, each student is required to file with the department a report of the first-year research activities. Students should discuss this report and the evaluation procedures with their adviser as early as possible in their first year. If the student fulfills the academic promise displayed upon entrance, he or she is invited to continue working towards the doctorate. The first-year evaluation is primarily based on three factors: quality of research carried out in the first year performance in courses (especially required courses) recommendations of the adviser (including a commitment on the part of that adviser to continue in that role).<query> how long does a phd candidate have to be evaluated</query> Second-Year and Beyond Evaluation—A similar evaluation is conducted at the end of each year of graduate training involving the same criteria as the first year; however, the student is not required to submit a paper. Students who are not making satisfactory progress may be dropped from the program. THE DOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM As indicated by the requirements described above, a student concentrates in any one of several areas within Psychology. Regardless of area, however, the training program places emphasis on the development of research competence, and students are encouraged to develop those skills and attitudes that are appropriate to a career of continuing research productivity. Two kinds of experience are necessary for this purpose. One is the learning of substantial amounts of technical information. A number of courses and seminars are provided to assist in this learning, and a student is expected to work out a program, with his or her adviser, to attain this knowledge in the most stimulating and economical fashion.<query> what is the purpose of a doctoral training program</query>"

Many patients are seeking relief from various causes of backpain including accidents, sport injuries and muscle strains. Other complaints include pain in the neck, arms and legs, andheadaches.<query> what is the cause of back pain</query> What is chiropractic care? Chiropractors use hands-on spinal manipulation and other complementary treatments, the theory being that proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable the body to heal itself without surgery ormedication. Manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event such as falling or by repetitive stress such as sitting without proper back support. Chiropractic is primarily used as a pain relief alternative for muscles, joints, bones and connective tissue such as cartilage, ligaments and tendons. It is sometimes used in conjunction with conventional medical treatment. A chiropractor in the UK must take and pass a course accredited by the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) and then be registered with the GCC. What does chiropractic care for back pain involve? A chiropractor first records your medical history and then performs a physical examination.<query> what is chiropractic care</query> He or she may use lab tests or diagnostic imaging to determine if treatment is appropriate for your back pain. The treatment plan may involve one or more manual adjustments in which the chiropractor manipulates the joints, using a controlled sudden force to improve range and quality of motion. Many chiropractors also incorporate nutritional counselling andexercise/rehabilitation into the treatment plan. The goals of chiropractic care include the restoration of function and prevention of injury in addition to back pain relief. What are the benefits and risks of chiropractic care? Spinal manipulation and chiropractic care is considered a safe effective treatment for acutelower back pain - the type of sudden injury that results from moving furniture or from a sudden jarring in sport. Acute back pain, which is more common than chronic pain, lasts no more than six weeks and typically gets better on its own.<query> what is the chiropractic treatment for back pain</query> Research has also shown chiropractic to be helpful in treating neck pain and headaches. Osteoarthritis andfibromyalgia also respond to the moderate pressure used by both chiropractors and practitioners of deep tissue massage. Studies have not confirmed the effectiveness of prolotherapy or sclerotherapy for pain relief, used by some chiropractors, osteopaths and medical doctors to treat chronic back pain - the type of pain that may come on suddenly or gradually and lasts for more than three months. The therapy involves injections to strengthen loosely connected tendons and ligaments. People who have osteoporosis, spinal cord compression or inflammatoryarthritis, or who take blood-thinning medications, should not undergo spinal manipulation. All treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis of your back pain. The chiropractor should be well informed regarding your medical history including ongoing medical conditions, current medications, traumatic/surgical history and lifestyle factors.<query> what kind of doctor treats back pain</query> Although rare, there have been cases in which treatment worsened a slipped disc, or neck manipulation resulted in astroke or spinal cord injury. To be safe always inform your doctor whenever you use chiropractic or other pain relief alternatives.

Introduction proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end.<query> what is computer programming</query> Just to give you a feel for what programming is like in a high-level language, here's a program that greets us, pretending to know English. print [Hello world!] This is one of the simplest programs that can be written in most high-level languages. PRINT is a command in Logo When it is performed, it takes whatever follows it and displays it. The ""Hello world"" program is famous;checkout its description on Wikipedia by clicking here. In addition to commands, Logo has operators that output some sort of result. Although it's a bit contrived, here is a program that displays the product of a constant number (ten) and a random number in the range of zero through fourteen. print product 10 (random 15) In this code, the PRINT command's input is the output of the PRODUCT operator. PRODUCT multiplies whatever follows it by whatever follows that and outputs the result. So,PRODUCT needs two inputs. RANDOM is an operator that outputs a number that is greater than or equal to zero (0) and less than the number following it. So, PRODUCT gets its second input from the output of RANDOM.<query> what is the print command in logo</query> Confusing? Don't worry, we will get into the details of operators in lesson 8. Finally, here's an advanced snipet of a program written in Logo, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. Here is a procedure definition for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers. to getMax :maxNum :numList if empty? : numList [output :maxNum] if greater? (first :numList) :maxNum [output getMax (first :numList) (butfirst :numList)] output getMax :maxNum (butfirst :numList) end Do not worry if this seems confusing. It will be a while before you will be writing anything like this. But, I want you to see that the words that make up the program's instructions and the instructions themselves are similar to English sentences, e.g., the first line and a half in the procedure are similar to the sentences: If the list of numbers to process is empty then output the maximum number processed.<query> what is the procedure for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers</query> If the first number in the list is greater than the maximum number processed so far then ... So, a high-level programming language is *sort-of* like English, just one step closer to what the language a computer really understands looks like. Now let's move on to what a computer's native language looks like when it is given a symbolic representation. Programming Languages (Assembler Language) One step above a computer's native language is assembler language. In an assembler language, everything is given human-friendly symbolic names. The programmer works with operations that the microprocessor knows how to do, they have symbolic names. The microprocessor's registers and addresses in the computer's memory can also be given meaningful names by the programmer. This is actually a very big step over what a computer understands, but still tedious for writing a large program. Assembler language instructions still have a place for little snipits of software that need to interact directly with the microprocessor and/or those that are executed many, many, many times.<query> what language is used to write a program</query> Table 1.1 is an example of DEC PDP-10 assembler language, a function that returns the largest integer in a group of them, named NUMARY. The group contains NCOUNT elements. Label OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register Comment GETMAX: MOVSI T1 400000 ; init T1 to smallest integer MOVE T2 NCOUNT ; get number of array elements GTMAX2: SOJL T2 [POPJ P,] ; decr idx, if -1 then done CAMG T1 NUMARY (T2) ; skip if T1 > array element JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number MOVE T1 NUMARY (T2) ; T1 gets new max number JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number Table 1.1 I'm showing you this so that you will have a feel for how primitive computer instruction sets are. I'm not going to go into the details of every instruction. If you want to go through it in detail on your own, the PDP-10 Machine Language is detailed here.<query> what is the function of pdp</query> A few points I want to expose you to are the general kinds of things being done. moving objects (numbers) into the computer's registers - very fast temporary storage, decrementing the value in a register, comparing the contents of a register to some value in memory, and transfering control to an instruction that's not in the standard sequential order - down the page. So, as you've seen, higher-level programming languages provide similar functionality and in a form that is closer to the English language. But there is a problem with assembler language - it is unique for every computer architecture. Although most deskside and notebook computers these days use the Intel architecture, this is only recently the case. And... a variety of computer architectures are commonly used in game systems, smart phones, tablets, automobiles, appliances, etc... Ok, we are almost at a point where I can show you machine language, the *native* language of a computer. But for you to understand it, I'm going to have to explain how everything is represented in a computer.<query> what language is used in computers</query> Inside Computers - Bits and Pieces Your computer successfully creates the illusion that it contains photographs, letters, songs, and movies. All it really contains is bits, lots of them, patterned in ways you can't see. Your computer was designed to store just bits - all the files and folders and different kinds of data are illusions created by computer programmers. (Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis, in ""Blown to Bits"") Basically, computer instructions perform operations on groups of bits. A bit is either on or off, like a lightbulb. Figure 1.1_a shows an open switch and a lightbulb that is off - just like a transistor in a computer represents a bit with the value: zero. Figure 1.1_b shows the switch in the closed position and the lightbulb is on, again just like a transistor in a computer representing a bit with the value: one.<query> what is the difference between a bit and a bit</query> Figure 1.1_a Figure 1.1_b A microprocessor, which is the heart of a computer, is very primitive but very fast. It takes groups of bits and moves around their contents, adds pairs of groups of bits together, subtracts one group of bits from another, compares a pair of groups, etc... - that sort of stuff. Inside a microprocessor, at a very low level, everything is simply a bunch of switches, also known as bits - things that are either on or off! Time to expand on how this is done; first let's explore how groups of bits can be used to form numbers. Numeric Representation With Bits There are only 10 different kinds of people in the world: those who know binary and those who don't. - Anonymous Computers are full of zillions of bits that are either on or off. The way we talk about the value of a bit in the electical engineering and computer science communities is first as a logical value (true if on, false if off) and secondly as a binary number (1 if the bit is on and 0 if it's off). Most bits in a computer are manipulated in groups, so we humans need a way to describe groups of bits, things/objects a computer manipulates. Today, bits are most often grouped in quantities of 8, 16, 32, and 64.<query> what is the microprocessor used for</query> Think about how you write down sequential numbers starting with zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc... Our decimal number system has ten symbols. In this sequential series, when we ran out of symbols, we combined them. You learned how to do this so long ago, in grade school, that today you just naturally think in terms of single digit numbers, then tens, hundreds, thousands, etc... The decimal number 1234 is one thousand, two hundreds, three tens, and four units. So, how does the binary number system used inside computers work? Well, with only two symbols, we would write the same sequential numbers as above: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011. The decimal number 1234 in binary is 10011010010. Since even reasonable numbers that we use all the time make for very long binary numbers, the bits are grouped in 3s and 4s which are simple to convert into numbers in the octal and hexadecimal number systems. For octal, we group three bits together. Take the binary equivilent of decimal 1234, 10011010010, and put spaces in between each group of three bits - starting at the right and going left.<query> what is the decimal number for 111</query> 10011010010 = 10 011 010 010 Now use the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (eight symbols, so OCTAL) to replace each group. 10 011 010 010 = 2 3 2 2 = 2322 The octal representations of the binary patterns are certainly easier to read, write, and remember than the binary counterparts. An even more compact representation can be achieved by grouping the bits in chunks of four and converting these to hexNumerals. When you group four bits together and use sixteen symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, A, B, C, D, E, and F) as their abbreviations, you have a hexadecimal representation.<query> what is the symbol for octal</query> 10011010010 = 100 1101 0010 = 4D2 As you continue to explore how computers work, you'll hear more about numbers expressed in octal and hex; these are just more manageable representations of binary information -the digital world. Table 1.2 compares the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems. Decimal Number in Binary in Octal in Hex 1 1 1 1 2 10 2 2 3 11 3 3 4 100 4 4 5 101 5 5 6 110 6 6 7 111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 9 1001 11 9 10 1010 12 A 11 1011 13 B 12 1100 14 C 13 1101 15 D 14 1110 16 E 15 1111 17 F 16 10000 20 10 Table 1.2 So, if the most common groupings of bits in a computer are 8, 16, 32, and 64, what kinds of numbers can these groups represent?<query> what is the hexadecimal number</query> pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something. An example would be to get weather information from the net and display it. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know. But, since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you need to know a little bit about how a computer works. Your job will be to instruct the computer to do things. Basically, writing software (computer programs) is describing how to do something. In its simplest form, it is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something - aprocess, a procedure. The lists of instructions that you will write are computer programs, and the stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, graphics, etc...<query> what is the definition of procedure</query> A group of eight bits has binary values 00000000 through 11111111, or expressed in decimal 0 through 255. A group of sixteen bits has binary values 0000000000000000 through 1111111111111111, or decimal 0 through 65535. I'm not going to type in binary representations for groups of 32 and 64 bits. The range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits is 0 through 4,294,967,295. The range of decimal values for a group of 64 bits is 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -or almost eighteen and a half quintillion. But wait... these numbers are all positive (Whole Numbers). If we are going to allow for subtraction operations on numbers, which can result in negative numbers, we need Integers. Modern computers use one bit in each of the groups to represent the sign (positive or negative) when the groups are used to represent integers. Table 1.3 shows the range of numbers that can be represented with groups of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits.<query> what is the range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits</query> Number of Bits Unsigned Maximum Value Signed Minimum Value Signed Maximum Value 8 255 -128 127 16 65535 -32768 32767 32 4,294,967,295 -2,147,483,648 2,147,483,647 64 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Table 1.3 That's about as deep as I want to get into the representation of numbers in computers and the binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems. Yes, computers have division operators but I am not going to cover numbers that include fractional parts, i.e., the""rational"" and ""irrational"" numbers due to the complexity of their implementations. If you want to read more, I googled and found what looks like a good place for you to read more. Start atAll About Circuits - Systems of numeration and read through it and continue on for a few more web pages in the series.<query> what is the number of bits in a hexadecimal number</query> Symbols as Bits - ASCII Characters Ok, so numbers are simply groups of bits. What other objects will the computer's instructions manipulate? How about the symbols that make up an alphabet? It should come as no surprise that symbols that make up alphabets are just numbers, groups of bits, too. But how do we know which numbers are used to represent which symbols, or characters as I'm going to call them from this point on? It's all about standards. In these lessons, we will use the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) standard. It is so ubiquious that it even has its own web page,www.asciitable.com. Let's walk through a couple of examples, entries in the table. Here are some characters, their decimal value and their binary value which is then transformed into an octal number.<query> what is the ascii symbol</query> Uppercase 'A' = decimal 65 = binary 01000001 = 01 000 001 = octal 101 Uppercase 'Z' = decimal 90 = binary 01011010 = 01 011 010 = octal 132 The digit '1' = decimal 49 = binary 00110001 = 00 110 001 = octal 061 Table 1.4 is a small slice from the full ASCII character set, just enough to give you a flavor of its organization. ASCII Character in Binary in Octal in Decimal in Hex space 00100000 040 32 20 ( 00101000 050 40 28 ) 00101001 051 41 29 * 00101010 052 42 2A 0 00110000 060 48 30 1 00110001 061 49 31 2 00110010 062 50 32 9 00111001 071 57 39 A 01000001 101 65 41 B 01000010 102 66 42 C 01000011 103 67 43 Z 01011010 132 90 5A a 01100001 141 97 61 b 01100010 142 98 62 c 01100011 143 99 63 z 01111010 172 122 7A Table 1.4 Here's a little trivia, from days long past when computers were so slow (compared with today).<query> what is the digit a in binary</query> Look closely at the binary representations of uppercase and lowercase letters. You can convert uppercase to lowercase by turning on a single bit. Or clearing the bit converts lowercase to uppercase. Clearing two bits will convert an ASCII digit to its numeric value. Setting the same bits converts a number in the range 0...9 into its ASCII character representation. Check Your Understanding So Far Take a moment to see if you understand the explanation of binary numbers. HERE is a jlogo program that converts an 8-bit byte into numbers and ASCII characters. Try it out! . Pixels The image on your computer's display consists of a bunch of colored points called pixels. A pixel is an object. It has a color and a position (its coordinates) which consists of the row and column it is at. Figure 1.1 shows an artist's rendition, a magnification of a display with a circle drawn in yellow.<query> convert numbers to ascii</query> The tiny black dots are the pixels and the big yellow dots are the pixels that have been colored. Figure 1.1 As an example, to display a thin vertical line, the color values of a column of pixels are set to the desired color of the line. If you want a thicker vertical line, you set the color values of the pixels of a group of consecutive columns to the desired color. Figure 1.2 shows a red line that's a single pixel wide and an orange line that's three pixels wide. The orange line is actually a very thin rectangle. Figure 1.2 So, the location of each pixel is obviously specified by a pair of numbers; what about the pixel's color? Well... a pixel's color is also specified as numbers, three of them, called RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. Play with the following Java applet which lets you see what number values generate which colors. What color do you get if you set red to 170, green to 85, and blue to 255? What's the RGB value for your favorite color?<query> what is the color of a pixel</query> alt=""Your browser understands the <APPLET> tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."" Your browser is completely ignoring the <APPLET> tag! Color Numbers Applet So, just as groups of bits represent numbers and symbols, they are used to form pixels. Ok... I've exposed you to a variety of objects that you commonly see when you are using a computer, things that can be manipulated with instructions in a computer programming language. Now let's move on to the computer's instructions, one more thing that is just a bunch of bits! Programming Languages (The Microprocessor's Language) So, all a computer has in it is bits. You've seen how they are used to represent stuff, pixels, numbers and characters. I've mentioned that computers perform operations on the bits, like move them around, add pairs of them together, etc... One final obvious question is: how are instructions that a computer performs represented?<query> what is the computer program used for</query> Well, if you instructed a computer in its native language (machine language), you would have to write instructions in the form of (yes, once again) binary numbers. This is very, VERY hard to do. Although the pioneers of computer science did this, no one does this these days. Just to give you something to look at, just to compare, Table 1.5 shows what the assembler language program in Table 1.1 could look like assuming that the machine instructions are loaded into memory at addresses 100 through 107. Also, the group of numbers starts at memory address 111 and the size of the group is in memory address 110. Address OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register 100 205 1 400000 101 200 2 110 102 361 2 107 103 317 1 111 2 104 254 102 105 200 1 111 2 106 254 102 107 263 17 Address Value 110 67 111 47316 . . . 177 2751 Table 1.5 A detailed explanation of any computer's instruction set is beyond what can be presented here. I just wanted you to see how the symbolic information in assembler language programs needs to be converted to numbers (bits) before a computer can perform it. If you really want more details now, here is a side lesson from one of my favorite introductory computer science books: The Computer Continuum.<query> what is the memory address of assembler language</query> The lesson walks you through programming a very simple robot computer. And, I wrote a simulator for the Robot Computer in jLogo that you can play with HERE. Summary Computer programming is composing/authoring of a process/procedure for doing something, in great detail. proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end. pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Since computers do not understand English and it would be impossible for a human to write a large program as a series of binary numbers that the computer can understand, we need something in between. High-level programming languages currently fit in this category. Given a programming language that you have chosen, you then follow its rules for composing statements (or expressions) that get the computer to do what you want.<query> what is computer programming</query> Because a computer is simply a very fast manipulator of bits (ones and zeros), through the the power of abstraction, computer scientists have layered levels of object representation and functionality, one on top of another. We have now been working on refining and extending these layers for over half of a century. Table 1.6 should give you a feel for where we stand with computer programming languages today. In the next lesson you'll start to write programs in Logo! Application-Specific Language(4GL) Examples: Mathematica, SQL High-Level Language Examples: Logo, Python Low-Level Language Example: C Assembler Language Example: Intel X86 Machine Language Example: Intel X86 Table 1.6 Exercise Cisco's Learning Network provides a game where you can test your ability to do binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions.<query> what language is logo</query> So, writing a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff. It has been argued that in its current state it is anart, not engineering. An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it. One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb but obedient. It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted. Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression. A deep understanding of programming, in particular the notions of successive decomposition as a mode of analysis and debugging of trial solutions, results in significant educational benefits in many domains of discourse, including those unrelated to computers and information technology per se.<query> why do you need to learn to program a computer</query> Click here to go to the website to test your ability.

Actually a person does not really understand something until after teaching it to a computer, i.e., express it as an algorithm."" (Donald Knuth, in ""American Mathematical Monthly,"" 81) Computers have proven immensely effective as aids to clear thinking. Muddled and half-baked ideas have sometimes survived for centuries because luminaries have deluded themselves as much as their followers or because lesser lights, fearing ridicule, couldn't summon up the nerve to admit that they didn't know what the Master was talking about. A test as near foolproof as one could get of whether you understand something as well as you think is to express it as a computer program and then see if the program does what it is supposed to.<query> how to understand something</query> Computers are not sycophants and won't make enthusiastic noises to ensure their promotion or camouflage what they don't know. What you get is what you said. (James P. Hogan in ""Mind Matters"") But, most of all, it can be lots of fun! An associate once said to me ""I can't believe I'm paid so well for something I love to do."" Just what do instructions a computer understands look like? And, what kinds of objects do the instructions manipulate? By the end of this lesson you will be able to answer these questions. But first let's try to write a program in the English language. Programming Using the English Language Remember what I said in the Introduction to this lesson? Writing software, computer programs, is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something.<query> what do computer instructions look like</query> Before we see what a computer programming language looks like, let's use the English language to describe how to do something as a series of steps. A common exercise that really gets you thinking about what computer programming can be like is to describe a process you are familiar with. Describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Rather than write my own version of this exercise, I searched the Internet for the words ""computer programming sandwich"" usingGoogle. One of the hits returned was http://teachers.net/lessons/posts/2166.html. At the link, Deb Sweeney (Tamaqua Area Middle School, Tamaqua, PA) described the problem as: Objective: Students will write specific and sequential steps on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Procedure: Students will write a very detailed and step-by-step paragraph on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for homework.<query> what is the computer programming language</query> The next day, the students will then input (read) their instructions to the computer (teacher). The teacher will then ""make"" the programs, being sure to do exactly what the students said... When this exercise is directed by an experienced teacher or mentor it is excellent for demonstrating how careful you need to be, how detailed you need to be, when writing a computer program. Here is teacher/mentor support material. Programming in a natural language, say the full scope of the English language, seems like a very difficult task. But, before moving on to languages we can write programs in today, I want to leave on a high note. Click here to read about how Stephen Wolfram sees programming in a natural language happening. Programming Languages (High-Level Languages) Almost all of the computer programming these days is done with high-level programming languages. There are lots of them and some are quite old. COBOL, FORTRAN, and Lisp were devised in the 1950s!!! As you will see, high-level languages make it easier to describe the pieces of the program you are creating. They help by letting you concentrate on what you are trying to do rather than that and how you fit it into a computer architecture. Theyabstract away the specifics of the microprocessor in your computer. And, all come with large sets of common stuff you need to do, called libraries.<query> what language do you use to write a program</query> In this introduction to programming, you will work with two computer languages: Logo and Java. Logo comes from Bolt, Beranek & Newman (BBN) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Seymour Papert, a scientist at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, championed this computer programming language in the 70s. More research of its use in educational settings exists than for any other programming language. In fact, the fairly newScratch Programming Language (also from MIT) consists of a modern graphical environment on top of Logo-like functionality. Java is a fairly recent programming language. It appeared in 1995 just as the Internet was starting to get lots of attention. Java was invented by James Gosling, working at Sun Microsystems. It's sort-of a medium-level language. One of the big advantages of learning Java is that there is a lot of software already written ( see: Java Class Library) which will help you write graphical programs that run on the Internet. You get to take advantage of software that thousands of programmers have already written. Java is used in a variety of applications, from mobile phones to massive Internet data manipulation. You get to work with window objects, Internet connection objects, database access objects and thousands of others. Java is the language used to write Android apps.<query> what is the difference between java and logo</query> So, why do these lessons start with the Logo programming language? I like the Logo language to teach introductory programming with because it is very easy to learn. The faster you get to write interesting computer programs the more fun you will have. And... having fun is important! But do not let Logo's simplicity fool you into thinking it is just a toy programming language. Logo is a derivative of the Lisp programming language, a very powerful language still used today to tackle some of the most advanced research being performed. Brian Harvey shows the power of Logo in hisComputer Science Logo Style series of books. Volume 3: Beyond Programming covers six college-level computer science topics with Logo. Both Logo and Java have the same sort of stuff needed to write computer programs. . They have the ability to manipulate objects including lots of arithmetic functions, you can compare objects and do different things depending on the outcome of the comparison, and they provide ways to control the order in which instructions get performed. And... that's what programming is really all about... as you will see.<query> what is logo programming language</query>"

Lomonaco is giving a talk on his research on quantum computing as part of the Joint Quantum Institute seminar series sponsored by UMCP and NIST. The talk will be given at 12:30pm Monday 17 October, in room 1201 in the Physics building at College Park. Quantum knots and quantum braids: Their possible application to superfluid vortices and to topological quantum computing in optical lattices.<query> what is sketching algorithm</query> In this talk, we show how to reconstruct knot theory in such a way that it is intimately related to quantum physics. In particular, we give a blueprint for creating a quantum system that has the dynamic behavior of a closed knotted piece of rope moving in 3-space. Within this framework, knot invariants become physically measurable quantum observables, knot moves become unitary transformations, with knot dynamics determined by the Schroedinger equation. The same approach can also be applied to the theory of braids. Toward the end of the talk, we look at possible applications to superfluid vortices and to topological quantum computing in optical lattices.

MS defense: Sawhney on Analyzing the Growth of Hoeffding Trees posted Tuesday, November 29th, 2011 MS Thesis Defense Analyzing the Growth of Hoeffding Trees Mayank Sawhney 12:00-1:30pm Thursday 1 December 2011, ITE 346 Mining high speed data streams has become a necessity because of the enormous growth in the volume of electronic data. In the past decade, researchers have suggested various models for learning in both stationary and concept drifting data streams. Hoeffding Trees (Domingos & Hulten 2000) are one such model for mining stationary data streams. Several modifications of the nave Hoeffding Tree algorithm have been proposed to study data streams.<query> what is hoeffding tree</query> Our work analyzes the behavior of Hoeffding Trees when they are trained on infinite and experiments, we show that the Hoeffding bound suffers from an inherent shortcoming. Even after reaching a stage where accuracy asymptotes, Hoeffding Trees continue to grow. We examine this behavior in data streams with both nominal and numeric attributes. We also study enhancements made to the naive Hoeffding Tree algorithm and also evaluate different discretization methods. In our work, we analyze how the Hoeffding bound relates to the information gain when splits are made and also when we send a random distribution as a data stream. We conclude that this behavior is a result of decisions made for the early growth of Hoeffding Trees and the induced randomness in an online setting. We also argue that the presence of this behavior will impact the use of Hoeffding algorithms in real world online applications.<query> what is hoeffding tree</query> Committee Members Dr. Tim Oates (Chair) Dr. Tim Finin Dr. Kostas Kalpakis MS defense: Pilz on Approximation of Nonintegral Frequency Moments, 11/30 posted Wednesday, November 16th, 2011 Masters Thesis Defense Approximation of Nonintegral Frequency Moments Brian Pilz 10:00am 30 November 2011, ITE325b Let a data stream have length m over an alphabet of n letters, with letter i occurring m_i times for i = 1,…,n. For any k, define the frequency moments F_k as F_k = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i^k. Alon, Matias, and Szegedy showed how to estimate F_k for integers k>0 with a one-pass algorithm using O(n^{1-1/k}log n) space for given length m, accuracy, and confidence. Here we extend those results to non-integral k obtaining bounds on the variance giving accuracy and confidence estimates, and giving quantitative results on the algorithm’s space requirements with particular interest to when k is near 1.<query> what is the approximated frequency moment</query>"

The attacks, by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the software assets can push their impact through Cyber Terrain – a dependency network of structural, spatial, functional and other domain-specific dependencies that exist among software assets and services, and reach the missions. In this presentation we will introduce a novel approach of assessing impact of cyber attacks on missions (business process) and describe the basic models and algorithms of the approach.<query> cyber security situation awareness and impact assessment</query> Dr. Gabriel Jakobson is the VP and Chief Scientist at Altusys Corp., a consulting firm specializing in the development of intelligent situation management technologies for defence and cyber security applications.

In 2009, their Scantegrity II voting system was used in the election of the mayor and city council members of Takoma Park, Maryland. This was an historic first time any end-to-end voter verifiable voting system with ballot privacy has been used in a binding governmental election. This week, absentee voters in Takoma Park, Maryland will have the option to cast their votes for mayor and city council using a new Internet voting system calledRemotegrity which uses the same approach of generating privacy preserving confirmation numbers that allow each voter to verify her vote is counted and anyone to verify that all the votes were counted correctly.<query> when was remotegrity used</query> Dr. Carback has played a significant role in helping Takoma Park adopt and use Scantegrity and Remotegrity in the municipal elections. Internet voting has been used to elect government officials before (for example, in Switzerland, Estonia, and Norway), but what is new here is that voters mail in paper ballots and use the Internet to independently verify that their votes have been received by the city and recorded correctly. Anyone can check online that the recorded votes were tallied correctly. Dr. Filip Zagorski, computer scientist at The George Washington University, explains ÒThrough the hybrid use of paper ballots and Internet verification, Remotegrity combines the best of both worlds to provide a very high degree of security even against malware and insider attack.Ó Portions of the underlying research in cryptography and secure server design were supported by the National Science Foundation and the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.<query> what is remotegrity</query> Voters who have requested to vote by mail receive a ballot which they mark and mail in, but they can also verify their vote on-line in the Remotegrity system, without revealing how they voted. In future elections, the same online procedure may cast votes and physical mailing of paper ballots may be optional or omitted. The city will also use the Scantegrity voting system for voters who cast their ballot in person, as it did in 2009. The integrated Scantegrity and Remotegrity systems offer full end-to-end voter-verifiability, in which voters casting ballots from home or in person can verify that their votes were correctly cast, collected, and counted. Additionally, this year, the city will provide an audio interface for marking ballots. The interface, named Audiotegrity, developed by researchers at The George Washington University, will enable voters with difficulty marking paper ballots to mark ballots independently using an electronic interface.<query> what is remotegrity voting system</query> Mr. Noel Runyan, a usability and accessibility expert, provided pro bono design advice to the Audiotegrity team. With a grant from the federal Election Assistance Commission, and support from the non-profit Voting Systems Institute, researchers from UMBC will survey voters and election officials as well as conduct focus groups around their experiences using these new voting systems.

Constraint Satisfaction for First-Order Logic Date: Friday, October 31st, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 William McCune Department of Computer Science University of New Mexico Abstract: I will describe the problem of searching for finite models of statements in first-order and equational logic. This is a kind of finite-domain constraint satisfaction. So far, the methods have been used mostly to search for counterexamples to conjectures, serving as a complement to programs that search for proofs. The expressiveness of the language and the power of the methods point to wider applications. The methods will be illustrated by using the Mace4 program on problems in abstract algebra and on several puzzles.<query> constraint satisfaction definition</query> The problem of isomorphic solutions will be addressed. Some background on automated deduction in first-order and equational logic will be included. Bio: William McCune has been working in automated deduction since 1981. He received a Ph.D. in computer science from Northwestern University in 1984 and worked at Argonne National Laboratory from 1984 through 2006, ending his tenure there as a senior computational logician. He was also a senior research fellow at the University of Chicago Computation Institute. He has been a part-time research professor in the UNM CS department since 2007, working on several projects with Prof. Robert Veroff. McCune received a Royal E. Cabell research fellowship in 1984, chaired the International Conference on Automated Deduction in 1997, and received the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Deduction in 2000.

For instance, as temperature increases past 100C, a dramatic change takes place in a pot of water. Similarly, an iron bar placed in a magnetic field will tend to suddenly magnetize (with most of the electron spins in the same direction) once the field strength passes a certain threshold. Similar changes can be observed in a number of systems of interest to computer scientists and statisticians.<query> what is phase transition</query> For instance, one can consider the behavior of the number of satisfying solutions to a Boolean formula, as the number of clauses slowly increases (say, by adding clauses at random). Or one could consider the number of components in a random graph, as a function of the number of edges. Other, closely related topics include: (1) efficient sampling of random configurations of a system using MCMC algorithms, (2) decay of correlations as a function of distance, and (3) uniqueness of something called ""Gibbs measure"" I will talk about some old and new results in this area. Bio: Prof. Tom Hayes received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. His thesis was on ""Rapidly Mixing Markov Chains for Graph Colorings.""

Nonconvex compressive sensing: getting the most from very little information (and the other way around) Date: Friday, October 10th, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 Rick Chartrand Los Alamos National Laboratory In this talk we'll look at the exciting, recent results showing that most images and other signals can be reconstructed from much less information than previously thought possible, using simple, efficient algorithms. A consequence has been the explosive growth of the new field known as compressive sensing, so called because the results show how a small number of measurements of a signal can be regarded as tantamount to a compression of that signal. The many potential applications include reducing exposure time in medical imaging, sensing devices that can collect much less data in the first place instead of collecting and then compressing, getting reconstructions from what seems like insufficient data (such as EEG), and very simple compression methods that are effective for streaming data and preserve nonlinear geometry.<query> what is compressive sensing</query> We'll see how replacing the convex optimization problem typically used in this field with a nonconvex variant has the effect of reducing still further the number of measurements needed to reconstruct a signal. A very surprising result is that a simple algorithm, designed only for finding one of the many local minima of the optimization problem, typically finds the global minimum. Understanding this is an interesting and challenging theoretical problem. We'll see examples, and discuss algorithms, theory, and applications. Bio: Born in Canada, Rick Chartrand's education was in pure mathematics, receiving a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1999 for work in functional analysis, in a subfield devoid of useful applications. He now works as an applied mathematician at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His research interests are focused on image and signal reconstruction from very incomplete information.<query> what is the convex optimization problem</query> He works on developing new algorithms, solving the underlying theoretical issues, and exploring useful applications. Petascale Computational Science on Roadrunner Date: Friday, October 3rd, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 Timothy C. Germann Deputy Group Leader of the Theoretical Chemistry & Molecular Physics Group (T-12) LANL Abstract: I will describe the initial set of scientific applications and computational kernels that have been implemented on the hybrid Roadrunner supercomputer recently constructed by IBM for Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Each Roadrunner ""triblade"" compute node consists of two AMD Opteron dual-core microprocessors and four PowerXCell 8i enhanced Cell microprocessors, typically utilized with a programming model of four MPI ranks (with one Opteron core and one Cell each) per node. I will describe our adventures first porting, and then drastically rewriting, a molecular dynamics code, SPaSM (Scalable Parallel Short-range Molecular dynamics), which is used for a wide range of scientific studies at LANL, ranging from fluid and materials dynamics to agent-based computational epidemiology.<query> what is the purpose of the roadrunner</query> The computation of forces and updates of particle positions and velocities are performed on the Cells (each with one PPU and eight SPU cores), while the Opterons direct inter-rank communication and perform periodic I/O-heavy tasks including analysis, visualization, and checkpointing. The nearly perfect weak scaling measured for a standard Lennard-Jones pair potential benchmark yields 369 Tflop/s (double-precision) floating-point performance on the full Roadrunner system (3060 compute nodes), and is a finalist for the 2008 ACM Gordon Bell Prize to be announced at SC08 in November.

Implementing Scheme in a Virtual World Date: Friday, September 12th, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 Lance R. Williams University of New Mexico Department of Computer Science Abstract: At any given moment in time, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are immersed in dozens of virtual worlds playing massive multiplayer online games (MMOG's). Second Life is unique among MMOG's because the players themselves create the content of the virtual world they inhabit.<query> what is the implementation scheme in a virtual world</query> They do this (in large part) by means of computer programming and I believe this fact makes Second Life a potentially important resource for computer science educators. Furthermore, because Second Life supports a programming model where a large number of small scripts execute in parallel and asynchronously, and communicate via message passing, it is an ideal testbed for research in many areas of computer science, including distributed computing, swarm robotics, self-assembly, distributed sensor networks, and artificial life. In this talk, I first provide an overview of Second Life and its programming model. I then describe and demonstrate a series of evaluators for the Scheme programming language which I have constructed inside the game, including one evaluator where the heap and virtual machine are represented in a completely distributed fashion as a school of swimming fish. In this way, I hope to illustrate Second Life's value to computer science pedagogy and as a testbed for research in distributed computation.<query> what is second life programming</query> Bio: Lance R. Williams received his BS in Computer Science from the Pennsylvania State University in 1985 and his MS and Ph. D in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1988 and 1994. His dissertation, in the area of computer vision, was on perceptual completion of surfaces which are only partially visible. After completing his Ph.D., he spent four years at NEC Research Institute in Princeton, NJ where he developed a series of increasingly more general neural models of the process used by the human visual system to compute the shape of object boundaries where they cannot be directly observed. In 1997, Dr. Williams joined the faculty of the Dept. of Computer Science at the University of New Mexico where he is currently an Associate Professor. His research since joining UNM has addressed a range of topics in computer vision, neural computation, digital image processing, and human and computer interaction.<query> who is lance williams</query> The ratio of electronics to vehicle equipment is steadily increasing. And novel vehicles will also have connectibility to public networks to provide many kinds of services. Therefore, they are expected to suffer from a wide variety of threats and the electronic control units (ECUs) embedded in them may execute malicious programs because of tampering. A requirement of vehicle system is difference to conventional embedded systems, e.g. cellular phone or home appliances. So it it hard to introduce existing technologies into vehicle systems without modifications. In this talk I will show these requirements and feature plan of our research.

Anomalous Change Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery Date: Friday, November 21st, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 James Theiler Space and Remote Sensing Sciences Group Los Alamos National Laboratory Abstract: The detection of actual changes in a pair of images is confounded by the inadvertent but pervasive differences that inevitably arise whenever two pictures are taken of the same scene, but at different times and under different conditions. These differences include effects due to illumination, calibration, misregistration, etc. If the actual changes of interest are assumed to be rare, then one can ``learn'' what the pervasive differences are, and can identify the deviations from this pattern as the anomalous changes.<query> what is anomalous change detection</query> While the straight anomaly detection problem is often expressed as a ""one-class"" problem, I will argue that it is really a two-class problem where the second (aka background or reference) class has implicit properties that are not always acknowledged. By adapting this background class, one can re-orient the machine learning methodology for anomaly detection to work for anomalous change detection. I will describe some of these theoretical issues as well as more practical problems that arise in the anomalous change detection problem, and show some recent results from an ongoing project at Los Alamos. Dependable Distributed Computing at AT&T Labs Research Date: Thursday, November 13th, 2008 Time: 3:30 pm — 5:00 pm Place: DSH 233 Mary Fernandez AT&T Labs Research University of New Mexico Abstract: In the Dependable Distributed Computing Research group at AT&T Labs Research, our research focusses on understanding and improving the performance, reliability, security, and management of networks and distributed systems.<query> what is the anomalous change detection problem</query> Despite this broad charter, our many projects share a common philosophy of using formal methods to model and analyze networks and distributed systems and of using declarative languages to specify and implement them. This philosophy yields practical benefits: High-level programming abstractions are semantically transparent, permit static analysis, and result in more secure and reliable systems. In this talk, I will give an overview of the research in our department, including our work in VoIP and secure overlay networks. I will then focus on Yakker, a tool for generating application-specific firewalls. Yakker firewalls examine network protocol messages that are the inputs to network servers and filters out malformed messages as well as other messages that can trigger, for example, buffer overflows. The novelty of Yakker is that it is highly automated, producing a simple firewall directly from existing human-readable specifications, namely, the “Request for Comments” documents that define most of the basic protocols of the Internet.<query> what is yakker</query> Bio: Mary Fernandez is Executive Director of Dependable Distributed Computing Research at AT&T Labs Research. Her own research sits at the juncture of database systems and programming languages and focuses on domain-specific languages for data management in centralized and distributed environments. She has published more than 30 articles in leading conferences and journals. In addition, she is co-editor of several World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendations, is Secretary of ACM SIGMOD, is an advisory council member of MentorNet (www.mentornet.net), and is a former associate editor of ACM Transactions on Database Systems. Energy-aware Server Provisioning and Load Dispatching for Connection Intensive Internet Services Date: Friday, November 7th, 2008 Time: 2 pm — 3:15 pm Place: ME 218 Wenbo He Department of Computer Science University of New Mexico Abstract: During the past 15 years, we have witnessed the tremendous growth of Internet applications.<query> who is mary fernandez</query> Energy consumption for hosting Internet services is becoming a pressing issue as these services scale up. Dynamic server provisioning techniques are effective in turning off unnecessary servers to save energy. Such techniques, mostly studied for request-response services, face unique challenges in the context of connection servers that can host a large number of long-lived TCP connections. Such servers usually limit on how many new connections they can accept per second and, therefore, a server cannot be fully utilized immediately after it is turned on. Moreover, before a server is turned off, all its active connections need to be reconnected or migrated to other currently active servers. In this talk, I will characterize unique properties, performance, and power models of connection servers, based on a real data trace collected from the deployed Windows Live Messenger. Using the models, we design server provisioning and load dispatching algorithms and study subtle interactions between them.<query> why is a connection server turned off</query> We show that our algorithms can save a significant amount of energy without sacrificing user experiences.

clueweb12-0502wb-93-29740,99,1,"APPENDICES DIALOGUES ON MORAL IMAGINATION DIALOGUE I: THE NEED FOR MORAL IMAGINATION THE PROJECT Since the time of Aristotle, the most notable reality in the world has been considered to be change. Often, its goals are most laudable, e.g., liberation of the person and the humanization of society. As a process, however, it presents the new and unknown, often the perplexing, and at times even the tragic. Thus, the changes in Eastern Europe give new and breathtaking hopes but are shadowed by lurking fears of collapse and conflict. One thinks, of course, of the city of Beijing, but what of the city of Washington where drugs have produced the highest murder rate and double the average rate of infant mortality in the country. The signs of progress in many Third World countries give founded hope, but this is tempered by recurrent threats to stability in other countries and a fortiori to the lives of their citizens.<query> why is the need for a mental image important</query> This suggests that there are levels of human life deeper than the political imagination. Some noted that the real roots of social problems are in breaking away from a foundational unity toward selfishness. This calls for a radical change of heart. In the Indian vision, this is called liberation (moksha ) in the summary sense of overcoming selfishness. A second indication of deeper levels of concern is that cultures do change. One profound instance is the transition from the Old to the New Testament sense of life. This is richly documented in biblical sources and in the rich literature of the early Christian Fathers. It was suggested that one might study, for instance, the way in which the notion of resurrection did not supplant but imaginatively transformed all previous symbols such as kingdom, divine presence and the way to combat evil in order to make possible the foundational development of a new culture.<query> what is the meaning of liberation</query> Who will do the planning? Some would turn toward the government as the sole instrumentality which represents all the people. But that points to a crucial contemporary problem, namely, that the exercise of power by governments often is carried out in selfish terms which are insensitive to the concerns of the disadvantaged. In an information age, governmental controls can be conducive not to a broader dispersion of power, but to its concentration and even greater intrusion into the redouts of the family and personal psyche. This would appear to suggest a number of considerations: (1) The form of government is not indifferent but must have the structures which disperse power and engage ever broader groupings of the people. (2) This can be revolutionary if it truly transforms the laws of development so that there results not a mere change of management and a new elite, but broader participation by the populace.<query> what is the role of the government in the information age</query> (3) For this a people must find in its heritage the sense of solidarity which provides the basis for considering such participation as a desirable goal to be strived for in an effort in which every accomplishment should be celebrated, shared and protected. How is this sense of solidarity symbolized and acknowledged by a people? Answers to this question will require research into their traditions and cultural heritage. Discovery of the grounding for this and of how it is to be understood in an ever more open, pluralistic and, in that sense, democratic manner is the task of the philosopher and the theologian. How this is to be implemented in socioeconomic and political structures which provide the synergies to implement and promote it is the task of our social scientists. All three are tasks of the creative imagination by which various peoples utilize their freedom in building their cultures.<query> what is the sense of solidarity symbolized by a people</query> There is much work to do. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA In Peru during the last eight years, a massive shift has taken place from the countryside to the city. This has been due in part to the intensification of guerrilla activity in the rural areas. More pervasively, however, it has been due to the search on the part of families for a richer life in the sense of greater opportunities for employment, education, medicine, etc. As the urban areas are, by definition, already occupied, the newly arrived population is forced to occupy land in the desert outskirts where they build settlements which require such basic public facilities as water, electricity and drainage. For the most part, however, the settlements are developed by the inhabitants, constructing their own houses and developing common kitchens, workshops, street commerce and urban planning.<query> what is the urbanization of peru</query> In this, the resource of community, rooted often in family and/or old village ties, is very important for providing the human context and the solidarity needed to face new difficulties. The urbanization in Villa El Salvador served as the focus for a study of the role of imagination in this process. Its range is very vast, from providing food and work to urban planning and sociopolitical organization, indeed, to every facet of life. The present study focused upon the development of housing through neighborhood initiative, adopting traditional materials and techniques and engaging the cooperation of architects and engineers. The theory behind this project is to begin with the real needs and conditions of the neighborhood and to employ imagination in looking for new solutions. Habermas’ distinguishes two levels of action. The first is that of technical reason which is concerned not with ends, but with means.<query> what is the role of imagination in the development of housing</query> Here the technician, as it were, owns the means and dictates the manner of their application. There is a tendency for this reason to absorb or dominate all else, which it proceeds to instrumentalize toward the well-being of its own technical system. In contrast to this is the realm of values and of personal interrelation or communication, the promotion of which is the special concern of the project. Hence, the technical specialist plays a different role, making available to the residents new technical possibilities. Rather, it is to empower the people to create their own new ways of solving their housing problem. This is done by developing models which employ and improve traditional materials and techniques for developing living space built around spaces reserved for open plazas and various community buildings which facilitate and implement community interaction. In some cases, models are designed especially for the residents, living in the area, to make changes.<query> what is the role of a technical specialist</query> In other cases, the model is constructed of children’s blocks in order to invite and emphasize the resident’s imaginative participation in working out the design. In still other cases, the plans are proposed at group meetings of residents in which the technicians participate as resource persons, assessing and advising on feasibility as the discussion proceeds. The residents participate in the building process itself, particularly in Sunday community or group work. Thus, they feel the community buildings really belong to them, and they learn the techniques through actually doing the work themselves. Moreover, the goal is not merely aimed at efficiency, but promotes the creativity of the group. Here, the theoretical underpinnings follow Habermas in looking beyond technical and practical rationalities to the realm of human interaction in which the persons, as such, become most fully alive. Hence, in facing the real and very serious problems of building an exterior, living environment, the interchange itself among the inhabitants is the basis of their properly human life.<query> why do people feel the community building really belongs to them</query> Their cooperation in working out their solution is not merely the resolution of a problem, but the heart of their personal process of liberation as persons in community. Similar cases were cited in Venezuela and Brazil. The goal is not to substitute older methods and structures by new, ""efficient,"" but culturally anonymous and dehumanizing concrete ""blocks."" Instead, over a period of decades families gradually rebuild the first shack built by the family on its new plot. Wall by wall, room by room, floor by floor the family living space is solidified, expanded and possibly moved to a second floor, making room for commercial or tenant space below. In this process the bonds of family and community play an essential role. Building often is a group activity crowned by celebration and fiesta. Indeed, some people prefer to remain in the barrios where they had grown up, feeling more secure and at peace with people they know, rather than to move to newer areas where they feel threatened and ill at ease among strangers.<query> what is the purpose of building a shack</query> Internal family structure differs according to cultures. Peoples bring from the countryside firm marriage bonds which tend to be attenuated in later urban generations. Conversely, some other groups moved toward greater family stability as their subsequent generations move to urban, middle-class status. Some noted the dynamism manifested in this process as an example of how an increase in numbers as people flocked to the city constituted a crisis situation which makes new quality or new forms of social organization necessary. This survival becomes a motive force; more classically, necessity becomes the mother of invention. Others would consider still other factors to be crucial and even more fundamental. For example, debt can lead indirectly to personal advancement if it enables one to utilize undeveloped capabilities or apply unused skills, but it is important to note that it is the skills, not the debt, which is productive.<query> why is necessity an important factor in social organization</query> There is the contrast between the situation of urban migration, such as that in Lima, and the disastrous situation of the refugee camps in, for example, Central America. The difference is not in the quantity of people brought together, but in the utilization of the personal resources of the people. This attention to personal and cultural resources allows one to focus upon and learn a number of important issues, as follows: (1) How is the work of the imagination carried out which in a matter of weeks enables 40,000 people to gather together in a manner in which they can begin to lay out an urban community with family plots, streets, etc.? (2) If providing for them in state owned buildings proves alienating and the concept of social property is too abstract to be truly humanizing, then what are the conditions for the development of authentic community facilities? Indeed, what properly is community? (3) The sole positive resources of the urban immigrants are the deep cultural values of sociality that reach beyond mere selfishness in the effort for survival.<query> what is the difference between urban migration and refugee camps</query> These bonds often extend over generations back in the villages of origin and broaden to include others in their new neighborhoods. These are the crucial humanizing factors providing positive reassurance, mutual support, identity and communicative opportunities. In turn, they make possible resilient cooperation in providing cooking, health and educational facilities and even basic public utilities. What then are these bonds? How can these values be promoted? If they favor a life within smaller villages or ethnically based groups, allowing at most coexistence with other groups, this will not suffice for the new pluralistic situation of the modern city. Further, if such ethnically centered values are factors of their self-identity, will not any effort to broaden these sensibilities be personally destructive and undermine the very sense of community which one wishes to foster? The terms of the problem would seem to suggest that the search for a broader commonality must be sought in and through, rather than in abstracting from, their sense of identity.<query> what is the purpose of ethnically centered values?</query> Insight from such a study could be of great importance for various parts of the world as they move, e.g., from agriculture to industry, and/or from industry to an information culture with its implied intensive interplay between cultures. The importance of attending to the imagination is reflected also in the field of liturgy. Whereas previously this had been treated only in terms of devotion and ritual, more recent phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches have brought out its deeper role as the central expression and, hence, realization of salvation through symbols. As has always been believed, it is now seen more clearly to be a reenactment through time of the Mysteries themselves. In this light, imagination begins to emerge not only as personal or a fortiori as personal fantasy, but as a social force more powerful even than rational cognition. This may augur a truly new age succeeding that of reason.<query> what is the importance of imagination</query> Some phenomenologists suggest that this can be done by looking at their identity as gifted and, hence, as relating to a common source and goal, that is, regarding their religious roots as simultaneously reinforcing their cultural identity and on its bases evolving distinctive senses of respect, love and concern for others. The resulting reinforcement of the right and dignity of all persons and groups also will raise important questions of national social policy which so imbalance the national social order that they reinforce the flight to the city in search for the benefits of modern life. Last Revised 21-Feb-09 08:15 PM.<query> what is the purpose of phenomenology</query> At the same time, we now can see how deeply enslaving has been colonial and ""melting pot"" efforts to erase the language and memory of a people and to substitute their culture with another’s store of images by which it understands itself and its world. Hence, critical consciousness is needed to assure that the new information age is not less, but more, free and rich than its predecessors. Imagination can and must become a creative and liberating force for projecting the future, nourishing hope and tracing utopia as the positive side of ideologies. This requires an in-depth analysis of the modes of imagination in narrative, ritual and song. This points, in turn, to the importance of literature and stories in the education of a child and of a people, and, hence, to the importance of exercising and developing the imagination.<query> what is the importance of imagination</query> This can be done in drawing and writing in which the person projects him- or herself beyond experience in order to bring out both the good and the bad, as well as the tension between the two. This makes it possible not only to build castles in the sky, but to analyze, illustrate and envisage solutions to the ills of society. Such a conjunction of the creative and critical aspects of the imagination can be the key to a realism that is truly progressive. DIALOGUE II: THE IMAGINATION IN ARISTOTLE, KANT AND RICOEUR In the range of reality from the material, as extended but not self-aware, to the spirit, as not extended but self-aware and self-determining, Aristotle conceives of the imagination as holding a mediating position. This has special relevance for our time precisely to the degree to which the Cartesian project of clear and distinct ideas first divided the human person between spirit and matter and later suppressed one in favor of the other.<query> what is the imagination of aristotle</query> The resultant loss of freedom and creativity in history has made it necessary now to put new emphasis upon synthesis and integration and to look at the human person wholistically. In this context a renewed interest has developed in the mediating and integrating role of the imagination. How should this be conceived? Is the imagination (a) a free agent weaving back and forth between spirit and matter in order to mediate between the two, after the manner ofThe Critique of Pure Reason? Or is it (b), as in The Critique of Judgment, neither the lowest or animal in the human person nor the highest or angelic therein, but the point of human integration whereby one is able to be most distinctively human and to act in a characteristic manner? The history of this notion in Aristotle and his school would appear to move subtly from (a) to (b).<query> what is the role of imagination in the human condition</query> The Greek etymology of the Latin term for ""imagination"" points beyond images and even imaging to the capacity to image. To understand this in Aristotle, one must begin from the notion of substance, for his understanding is rooted in being. Hence, he does not look first to imaging or to a general flow of consciousness in which the person would be absorbed, but to the strong sense of the constitution as a distinctive being in one’s own right and with one’s own characteristic level of being and life project. Of itself, this does not bespeak freedom, for it is characteristic of substance on all levels of reality from the most material to the most spiritual. But it is a prerequisite for freedom at the level of self-conscious beings, for without this autonomy one would be but a function of some larger material universe, social class or all-powerful state.<query> what is the latin word for imaging</query> IMAGINATION AS INDEPENDENT AND CREATIVE In the gradation of being, particularly as it is found in the one human composite or synolon, Aristotle proceeds in hisDe Anima to pry open some ""space,"" as it were, for the imagination by distinguishing it from spirit and matter. In so doing, he establishes its two special characteristics, namely, independence and creativity. Aristotle establishes the independence and freedom of imagination vis à vis, on the one hand, opinion as the lowest level of intellect and, on the other hand, the senses. The independence he discerns is both objective and subjective. The imagination has objective independence because it depends upon the will and, hence, is not instinctively or necessarily moved by external stimuli. Therefore, it is able to work out alternatives, rather than be held to reporting upon given status of affairs.<query> what is the independence of imagination</query> Further, the imagination also has subjective independence. Since it is not reporting on a real external state of affairs, it does not feel threatened by an imagined danger as it would by one which it knew or opined. Indeed, it can continue to function even in the absence of external objects. Thus, the imagination enjoys a unique degree of independence in Aristotle’s realistically oriented philosophy. This will give it unique importance wherever creativity is required on the part of the person or society. Aristotle traces the liberation of the imagination from a state of domination by the senses to one of creative life for the spirit through a combination of three characteristics. First, the imagination serves as the subject of the flux of consciousness — a sensation of sensations; it variously relates contrary notions derived from the senses. Secondly, it is productive (poiesis) for it does not merely receive sense data but actively elaborates images regarding the common sensibles.<query> what is the imagination</query> In this sense it opens forms to the full range of their possible dialectical relations. Thirdly, it is peculiarly free, at least in the sense of indetermination, for it is not bound or oriented to a single goal but stands more properly in the productive order of efficient cause. Thus, it is rightly called creative for it is the source of action which is productive and free. THE ROLE OF THE IMAGINATION IN RELATION TO KNOWLEDGE, MORAL ACTION AND BEAUTY On the basis of these two characteristics of independence and creativity, Aristotle in his various works and his school in later ages, was able to delineate further the range of the imagination by studying it in relation to truth or thought, to the good via action and to beauty and the aesthetic order. (a) The role of imagination in relation to truth and thought was progressively enriched.<query> what is the role of imagination in the world</query> Aristotle’s emphasis upon realism necessitates that all come through the senses to the intellect in order to assure the real content of intellectual knowledge. Thomas’ further emphasis upon the unity of the person implies that the human intellect must work with the body and, indeed, intuit the nature of things in the sense images. The imagination then is not only a conduit to the intellect, but an integral factor in any integrally human act of knowledge. This implies three essential human abilities: (a) the ability to return via the phantasm to the concrete individuality of others — and, hence, to be able to recognize and respect their freedom; (b) the ability to unfold the meaning of a phantasm by varying and completing its structure, etc.; and (c) the ability thereby creatively to open new possibilities via these new combinations or patterns in the imagination.<query> what is the importance of imagination</query> Continued progress on all levels — sociocultural, politico-economic and moral — depends upon values by which we direct our daily lives and build our future. As such values emerge out of our experience and history and come to us as tradition, the challenge of change forces us to look back for the resources of human vision and forward to new ways for human life. Such issues have been examined and written in a series of volumes, regarding the nature and experience of values, especially in the face of such present issues as intercultural conflict, the crisis of values in urban life and the emerging sense of the person in society. The project has included studies on the various cultural regions as well as the implications of all these for the philosophical, psychological and pedagogical horizons of moral education and character development.<query> what is the importance of values in society</query> (b) For the role of the imagination in relation to the good and action, Aristotle relates action to desire, which in turn depends upon the imagination in working out what can be desired. Through generating pleasure, by which we are moved to action, the imagination can reinforce our tendencies to good or evil. As itself, the imagination is morally insensitive; however, this generates the problem of the controls by the person and the intellect over the imagination. This, in turn, implies the entire moral task of developing a proper interrelation between the virtues and values by which we activate our moral life. The role of the imagination in relation to beauty and the aesthetic becomes particularly crucial as the need for synthesis intensifies. Because beauty unites the true and the good according to the classical formula that beauty is ""that which pleases when seen,"" the imagination can serve to unite knowledge and action.<query> what is the role of imagination in moral life</query> Thereby it can contribute to creative action which goes beyond that which can be emulated by a computer, calculated by the intellect, or legally enforced in the public arena. Beyond all this the imagination calls us to even higher standards of harmony and beauty in human affairs. It reaches, also, within to the center point of our personhood and identity from which we respond integrally and, hence, most humanely to others. In this manner in the Aristotelian tradition, the imagination appears as central to the deepest levels of our personhood, enabling our life to be both affective and effective, responsive and loving, creative and free. KANT Freedom must be related not simply to self, but to productive action. To do this Kant needed the imagination in order to find a way between Leibniz’s reason without person and Hume’s individual without community.<query> what is the imagination</query> This can be seen by returning to the basic pre-Socratic material elements, atoms and space, and observing how Democritus escaped the classical dilemmas of Zeno by introducing elements of the imagination to synthesize the intervals of space and time. For Kant this unitive element was the pure form of intuition. In dialectical terms this would deny both thesis and antithesis, but rather than uniting them in a synthesis, it would transcend them both. The work of the imagination is this very process of transcending which the imagination carries out in terms of space and time. In this, Kant echoes the above description of the imagination in Aristotle as the flow of consciousness integrating contraries derived from the senses. For Kant, the requirement of a subject for this work of synthesizing opposites points to a transcendent order. He treats this not in a Hegelian manner through a four valued logic, but as a transcendental deduction of categories.<query> what is the work of imagination</query> Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason is concerned with the prerequisites for scientific knowledge and identifies only the elements necessary for that project. Thus, the imagination does not figure there as a factor in the exercise of freedom, which is treated rather in his second work, of practical reason. Imagination, as a free creative factor, assumes its leading position above even reason in his third,Critique of Judgment. Even the first critique, however, raises a series of questions, regarding the degree to which the mind enters the very creation of any representation and, therefore, is integral to all knowledge. It suggests a characteristically modern turn to subjectivity and raises the question of how this can be, not the destruction of objectivity, but its conscious implementation. In this, it suggests and goes beyond the Aristotelian tradition in which even the mind is active in contrast to being simply a passive process of imaging, ormimesis , as in Plato.<query> what is the purpose of kant's critique of pure reason</query> Ricoeur’s treatment of metaphor and tragedy can be suggestive here. It points out how metaphor begins with existing meanings, but by developing contraries generates new meaning. Later he turns to tragedy as drawing out the virtualities of existing reality. These possibilities can be seen in many ways and indeed constitute the whole image-making industry ranging from heroes to horrors, from Disney to Goebbles. This can express the collective unconscious as well as the clear intent of individuals. Freud and Habermas make possible psychological and social critiques, while more metaphysical approaches are needed in order to critique and direct deeper levels of personal freedom. PAUL RICOEUR Of the three Kantian critiques regarding, respectively, speculative knowledge, moral knowledge and aesthetic sensibility, Ricoeur looks to the last in search of the principles for the unity of a human life and project.<query> who is ricoeur</query> Dilthey had completed Kant’s critiques by adding historical reason as this receives from the past the life experience and sensibility expressed in different cultures. Gadamer focuses this work upon tradition, which he treats as a text in order to understand communication between various cultures or parts of tradition. In order to avoid the fragmentation which appears when human psychic life is divided between faculties, Ricoeur focuses rather upon the operations of the human person. Hence, he treats especially the cognitive, affective and teleological roles of the imagination in both individual and social life. He begins this by studying what it is to will and to imagine. He finds that this constitutes a language in order to express our being as directed toward the future and as capable of fault. Both are rooted in a deeper desire to be fully, that is, to be without boundaries, and infinitely expanding.<query> who is ricoeur</query> His dialogue, as it were, with Freud brings out the teleological and interpretative roles, not of images, but of imaging itself. In this he searches for the way in which this is inserted into action, helping us to express its meaning and to project before us new types of action. Here, metaphor plays a central role; indeed, Ricoeur replaced symbol by metaphor as giving rise to thought because metaphor does not merely repeat or restate, but reshapes, language. By redescribing reality, we recreate it. This is reflected to an even greater degree in Aristotle’sRhetoric and Poetic where tragedy describes, not how things are, but how things could be through a reordering of what already is. Applied to the whole of life, this provides a way, not merely of repeating through redescribing and recreating what is, but of taking hold of the past in ways which never were.<query> what role does metaphor play in literature</query> Thus, metaphor allows us to look ahead or in front as it were in order to envisage life that is truly new. In social language the use of symbol corresponds to ideologies as ever repeating themselves, whereas metaphors would correspond to utopias. For Ricoeur ideology retains a positive sense of presenting reality in a comprehensive manner, but needs something in the order of utopias in order to find goals, to take society beyond itself and to provide a sense of history. At least three issues appear to emerge here: (1) how imagination can serve to unite human projects and enable us to encompass all fields, bridging times and cultures; (2) the need for imagination in order to give birth to action; (3) and the need to go beyond representation as reproduction to memory and the creation of new possibility.<query> what is the ricoeur ideology</query> DISCUSSION The creative role of the imagination can be illustrated by various stories and parables which make manifest the process by which a people shapes its history in a positive fashion, for our self-understanding lies within a larger whole, orplethos, which itself is a human cultural creation. At points of sharp cultural change, such as the 1960s with the breakdown of many institutions, we must search for new symbols in order to maintain and develop our lives. These are found in the stories of a people and include both actual happenings which take on symbolic moment and creations of the imagination which express deeply felt truths about a people’s life and experience. Such texts play a number of roles which exceed the capabilities of actual experience: (1) First, they recreate experience which, as happening in time, occurs once and then passes away or becomes increasingly distant.<query> what is the role of imagination in the story of a person</query> Or, should it be said that such a fleeting notion of time itself lacks the perdurance which reality possesses before and through human consciousness or that things last not merely as memories but in and though their relation to the images of the mind. (2) Secondly, with such texts the imagination can provide for a certain distantiation. Beyond the immediacy of the now in which an event occurs, human consciousness is able, as it were, to take hold of an experience, hold it up before its gaze, look at it from many facets and respond to it more reflectively and integrally. Music may suggest something of this if we ask in what senses sad music can be not only less, but more, than a sad experience. (3) Thirdly, in developing these stories the imagination is not held simply to what it finds in actual experience itself.<query> what is the imagination in music</query> The present study grows out of this overall context. It is focused upon imagination, with special attention to three factors. The first is the work of the imagination in integrating the various human capabilities or faculties by bringing together the contributions of the various senses and of the intellect. Should the imagination be considered as mediating from the senses to the intellect, or vice versa? Does it provide the images in reference to which the intellect does its own work? Or could it reach even beyond the intellect to provide a point of higher integration of intellect and will, spirit and body in the manner suggested by the third Kantian critique? Secondly, some functions of the imagination bring new hope. Many of the problems of contemporary thought reflect the way in which technical and abstract reasoning has desiccated the context of human life today by forcing all into univocal and universal categories insensitive to the uniqueness of the person.<query> what is the function of imagination</query> It is able to project implications which have not yet occurred, to consider alternate implications among which one can choose those which actually will occur, and, therefore, to avoid evil consequences and to cooperate in the realization of the good. There are broader and deeper implications of this in the thought of Ricoeur. For his concern is not simply with the management of day-to-day events, but with the realization of persons and peoples as they strive toward fulfillment. Here the level is not that of resolving psychological stress or achieving social justice, but more profoundly how these — and all else — can be a manifestation of the goodness of being in time. The opposite of this is the negation of being, which in contrast to goodness is sin. Thus, his concern is the foundational one of whether we, as persons and as peoples, are open to the infinite source of being and goodness, or are so turned into ourselves as to be closed to all, but our own limited, resources.<query> what is ricoeur's concern</query> For the human spirit, such a closure upon oneself would spell an ultimate self-negation of being and the good at its source: it would be the original sin, setting the fate of all of our life. Hence, his radical question is how this totalizing question is posed, recognized and responded to in our lives as persons and peoples. How are we able to become conscious of the issue of the basic orientation of our life? How are we ever free to be able to take hold of our personal lives? It is here that the issue of sin as a whole and at its roots emerges, and from it, correspondingly comes our own resurrection and liberation. We might attempt to treat this with abstract categories, but that would assure that we abstract precisely from our own most personal decision. We need instead to attend above all to that option by which we set the basic orientation of all our particular decisions and determine what our whole life, with all its struggles and achievements, will add up to.<query> what is the issue of sin</query> This requires a concrete mode of thought for which and in which imagination is an essential component. First, it can bring my free and, hence, my uniquely personal actions for evil or good into evaluation and judgment; secondly, it can imaginatively reorder and redirect the real components of my life (conversion); and thirdly, it can decide upon the future orientation of my life (resurrection and commitment). It should not be thought, however, that this is only a personal matter, for as humans we are essentially and not only accidentally members of a community. Thus, the issues which have just been stated in personal terms must be taken not only in an individual sense, but in a social sense as well. Nations, too, have their original sin and their basic choices to make and to implement.<query> what is the purpose of imagination</query> For example, in the U.S. this sin could well be the fact of slavery as the contradiction of that nation’s founding, enlightenment principles of freedom, equality and brotherhood. Its Civil War was fought on this issue, and its basic decision on the matter made. However, each of its ramifications for education, health care and housing presents a quandary, a difficult struggle and a perilous outcome. Is it possible for a people to read the history of slavery as tragedy, to set Lincoln as its symbol of liberation, and to redirect its future not only in principle, but wholly and with concrete implications for each person and each decision? If not, then the notion of a free people has little meaning in making decisions that are truly pervasive and working out their ever unfolding meanings. In doing this, it is not sufficient to look only to the future, for that is a blank tablet: it is not yet written and provides nothing to draw upon for our understanding and orientation.<query> what is the significance of slavery</query> We need rather to look to the past for what has been seen, valued and chosen. We look to what has been so valued as to be passed on as a key to a decent life for the next generation, and then reaffirmed in being passed on (tradita) time and again from generation to generation. This is truly the fruit of the human spirit freely responding to the good, which it cumulatively proclaims. Some consider it important that we reaffirm this tradita in our day, that we rejoice in it, celebrate it and proclaim it in fiestas and festivals in order to pass it on to the next generation. Others see such rituals, festivals and fiestas as in danger of being a simple repetition of structures which either have been oppressive in the past or are inadequate and, hence, retrogressive in relation to the modalities of life in the present.<query> why is it important to reaffirm tradita</query> This latter view calls for a critical hermeneutics to focus upon changing the structures in such ways as to permit and promote the growth of freedom in our day. It may be that both approaches — celebration and critique — have an essential contribution to make. Structures are important — increasingly so as life becomes more complex and technically structured. Those which were, or now are becoming, restrictive and repressive must be recognized as such and changed. But changed in terms of what? If it is true that mankind has not only experienced certain structures of social organization but has discovered thereby something of what it is to be human, just and loving, then it is crucial that these lessons be not lost but proclaimed. If mankind is not to be run by a history or a system but to direct these toward promoting human life, then such values must be proclaimed and enjoyed.<query> why are structures important</query> If these values are to be not formal restrictions but dynamic and creative principles in our life, then they need to be proclaimed and enjoyed in an open, even playful manner, that is, they need to be celebrated. Only thus can they spark the creative imagination and gives hope to the heart that problems of the present can be faced by peoples in a manner that will lead to a future worthy of their members. DIALOGUE III. THE NEW INTEREST IN THE IMAGINATION IMAGINATION, RATIONALISM AND NATURAL EXPERIENCE A major source of contemporary difficulties lies in the very triumph of scientific and technical reason from which our times derive its capabilities. The ability to abstract from the wholeness and integrity of concrete reality enables one to focus upon certain aspects. The result of this capability when applied with the modern fascination for clarity and control has been to reduce man’s horizon to but one or another dimension of reality.<query> what is the new idea of imagination</query> Despite the full range of experience, this unilaterally absorbs all of man’s concerns and sensibilities, leaving no room for the imagination to envisage new possibilities. To live in such a society is to be correspondingly restricted because all other dimensions of a person or a people are rejected and oppressed. This can be experienced when exclusive stress upon reason and dogma by a church results in the countersign of the inquisition. In our days, it has been experienced in the intensively scientific materialism of Marx with its resulting totalitarianism. The way out of this will require imagination, which is not manipulated by another one-sided ideology such as fascism. Where can we recuperate the plenitude of sensibility wherein such imagination can truly unfold and explore? It was suggested that this can be done not in intellectual terms alone which are essentially subject to the above limitations, but in incarnational terms in which the intellect is incorporated within the integral person and the person, within his or her social context.<query> what is the way out of totalitarianism</query> This is as close to us as our infancy in which we were bonded to our mothers from whom our life had emerged. This is not merely a physical, psychological or social relation, but all of these entwined in the integrity of our persons. It can be detected in the Genesis accounts in which Adam not merely dominates nature by categorizing and naming it, but begins truly to live in this world by seeing it reflected in the eyes of Eve. What appears in the original story of these personal relations is not that man is evil, but good. This provides a strong insight into the African and Chinese cultures and implies a profound shift in one’s attitude toward death, and, hence, to life as well. Others would note that the sense of the fallenness of man can be poorly or excessively conceived in terms of a corruption of human nature itself, it thereby generates a dour sense of life and a presumption of interpersonal attitudes of conflict.<query> what is the meaning of the word fallen</query> Nevertheless, the opposite presumption of innocence is dangerously romantic. African myths do not omit the sense of surrounding evils, protection against which is a pervasive — some would say, strongly restrictive — preoccupation. The notion of original sin is directed toward taking account of the deep reality of alienation in the world. To deny this in favor of a lost innocence or an original joy would be to fail to face the real challenges and psychological restrictions of human life. Integral and realistic human engagement in life comes, then, not through a claim to innocence, imaged as an idyllic incarnation of spirit in matter, but through evil, consciously encountered and overcome, that is, through redemption and resurrection. Further there is danger in working cross-culturally. One’s own culture cannot only be taken as normative for all others — such cultural imperialism has characterized modern mentalities whose evolutionary presumption implies that their present view rightly surpasses all others; but the opposite can be true as well.<query> what is the opposite of innocence</query> The work of the imagination, by mediating a concrete incarnation of the spirit, could provide the abstractive intellect with access to the concrete and, hence, with the means of reference to the unique reality of the human freedom of self and others, both individually and socially. Thirdly, as a point of integration of the human personality, the imagination can point to that center which is most profoundly personal, not merely as the foundation of the multiple human powers or faculties, but also as the dynamic wellspring or source of life. It should be here that the person is enabled to envisage what can and needs to be and to take creative action to realize what is truly new. The study of imagination in these terms should contribute on three levels. (1) First, it will be part of the general corrective move from a one-sided attention to objectivity toward integrating the self-conscious and self-determining dimensions proper to the subject.<query> what is the purpose of imagination</query> In finding much that is good in earlier cultures, there is danger of becoming overly pessimistic about the mentality of our own day or culture. The result would be a reverse imperialism, but an imperialism, nonetheless. This can be dangerous if the world is becoming not necessarily better, but certainly more complex and technically sophisticated. For in that case, the issue of evil and alienation itself becomes more complex and more dangerous and requires a proportionately rigorous and penetrating response. Where then is one to find the radically humanizing insights which become ever more necessary, but less vivid conscious in our increasingly technical culture? Where no single source can suffice, a combination of resources might yet succeed. The increasing evidence of the inadequacies, on the personal and international levels, of the imperialism of abstractive rationality (despite its obvious contributions), has been forcing people to look for additional dimensions of human awareness and meaning.<query> what is imperialism</query> Though these are available in one’s own family experience, what is close to home is often least noticed. For this reason, it can be important to pay attention to alternate modes of human sociality as realized in other, and often earlier types of communities which have been less affected by the rationalization of modern urban life,. Patterns of small communities of tribal and village life can provide new or renewed insight for those who are experiencing depersonalization and alienation. In Latin America such communities have been found to facilitate a renewed humanization of life within an impersonal context for new urban immigrants, and these basic Christian communities, in turn, suggest new possibilities for other cultures. Of course, to attempt simply to import or mimic such alien, living patterns would itself be alienating, but they can point one to dimensions of life which were present in one’s own personal experience of human life and meaning as lived in one’s family.<query> what is the purpose of a christian community</query> Beyond this they can direct attention to elements common to culture providing, thereby, a shared foundation and consensus upon which a people can begin to work together in elaborating their future. This shared point of reference and set of values is the stuff of lived freedom. It has been tried, tested and found to be good. This wisdom, reaffirmed freely and passed on as tradition, provides resources upon which we as a people can work with our imagination to shape new ways of living in response to our new times. These resources of a tradition contain not only spontaneous and unreflected experience, but the results of millennia of reflection. This is the achievement of peoples in working out more adequate and equilibrated responses to the dilemmas of person and community, of man and nature, of nation and nation in the social, political, economic and cultural dimensions of human life.<query> what is the meaning of traditions</query> This has been elaborated in the philosophies and theologies of the various cultures; it is an essential part of the progression of their peoples. As time progresses, peoples meet new circumstances. In the past, these may have been environmental changes; today they are more likely to be the technological, economic or cultural impact of other peoples. In one’s own search, there is nothing unnatural, unworthy or unfitting then in a people’s turning to the philosophical and theological resources of those peoples in order to resolve dilemmas related to the impact of those culture. What is important is that those cultural resources be used for the development of a people’s own identity and roots, rather than for their suppression and/or substitution by alien cultures. Hence, in its situation of desiccating abstraction and hyper-rationalization, Western cultures might well look to the cultures, for example, of Latin America and Africa for their living experience of community with its spontaneity and original joy and to India for its exalted sense of being.<query> why is it important to use cultural resources</query> Conversely, some in those places might wish to look to the West not only for technical implementation, but for its related Enlightenment ideals of democracy and for its longer, philosophical and theological tradition of grappling with issues of alienation, which industrial and urban displacement is now exacerbating in those regions. Some see this illustrated in Chinese culture. There the Confucian tradition puts great stress on the dual sense of duty and obligation, rooted in a sense of the goodness of man and the hope of having the perfect leader whom all should follow. This is balanced by Taoism which provides an attitude of joy regarding both life and death, to the extent of seeing no real difference between the two. Its playful attitude can be seen as freeing one’s creativity. Today these attitudes face new problems. Confucian duty can be manipulated into subservience to a bureaucratic absolutism, and for the young and inexperienced the rich, Taoist sense of play can often degenerate into responding to life simply in terms of what is considered ""fun."" Even if one were to find richer and more positive roots in the integrating experience of infancy or in the interpersonal relations of family and small groups, would these roots to provide sufficiently strong foundations for the claims of human dignity today in the face of political, economic and informational forces of alienation?<query> what is the confucian sense of duty</query> It is here that the religious grounding of the many cultures provides the needed basis for the human person and for his or her dignity and rights. These need to be grounded not merely in the fallible and self-centered will of the collective, but in infinite and all-perfect being, freedom and love. Beyond original joy, God is love — and for the Hindus, it is Bliss (Ananda ). Further, Christianity’s recognition of evil, and, hence, its conception of resurrection as anticipation of new and higher life, provides not simply stable values, but the diachronic vision for continued struggle. It does this not merely in terms of the dynamics of material forces, but with the founded hope of success that enlivens truly human creativity, sacrifice and success in the face of great difficulties.<query> what is the meaning of resurrection</query> This could explain the very rapid development of Christianity today in, for example, Africa and Korea. Coming to a point in the life of their people where new and more complex problems are being faced, there is need for a correspondingly complex, sophisticated and richly nuanced, religious vision. Such a vision cannot substitute for the personal experience of original joy, but it can be important in working out the way in which this can be lived in more complex times: when evil has new powers, the watch must be more alert and the weapons more elaborat. In this sense, Christianity has come in our days to describe itself more correctly not in the latter trappings of imperial power, but in its original form as a leaven, enabling all cultures to live their original joy by continually confronting the reality of evil and rising to new life.<query> why is christianity important</query> DIALOGUE IV. THE ROLE OF IMAGINATION IN RELIGION IMAGINATION AND THE RELIGIOUS QUEST Theological studies have taken different orientations in the last century. The first was critical history which looked for the sources of the text. These lay behind the scriptural text, and one attempted to reconstruct that history. In a similar manner, critical history sought to reconstruct the past history of Christianity. The second and more recent orientation focuses upon the text but is oriented toward what might be seen as ""in front of"" the text. It interprets this in the light of the text in order to constitute a narrative which shapes the reality to come. Thus, if the text speaks of the Kingdom of God, then it would be the task of the imagination to understand and interpret my life, history and the world as a whole in a manner which evolves my story in a new way as part of that kingdom.<query> what is the role of imagination in theological studies</query> Another major scriptural theme is that of holiness. The new task is not merely to understand what came before that text and thence to define its meaning, nor is it to proceed theologically in an a priori manner to deduce its meaning from other theological notions. Rather, the task is to work out what holiness is to mean for me in my life and times. This could be exemplified through the development of these texts at the time of the writing of the New Testament. At that point the world of the Old Testament was breaking up under the impact of the Roman Empire; the new world of the diaspora was opening before them. ""Being religious"" had to mean something new in these new circumstances; it was the task of the imagination to work out what that new meaning would be. To plot, survey, engineer and construct the path ahead was a radically new task which would test the imaginative and creative genius of mankind.<query> what is the purpose of the scriptural theme</query> When one speaks of the radically new, one need not necessarily or even primarily mean simple substitution or dislocation. To destroy all and build anew is too simple and simplistic a solution. As with urban renewal, an approach which totally clears a space and rebuilds results in something homogeneous and bland when compared to renewal that preserves the different characteristics of the terrain, both natural and man made, and evolves all in a new and rich harmony. This would appear to be the reality of the Judeo-Christian experience. By integrating earlier scriptures and the long history of God’s providence with his chosen people, the New Testament achieved its great depth of meaning and rich resonance. Something decisively new is taking place as these earlier elements are reordered and newly interpreted in terms of the new dispensation of God’s providence in sending His own Son into time for our redemption.<query> what is the radically new</query> (2) Socially, it should contribute to the effort to overcome mass and excessive systematization and to make room for the person, for creativity and for personal initiative and, hence, for the cultures which humans create. This, in turn, will enable us to work upon the issues of intercultural relations and build toward respect for others and that harmonious cooperation which truly promotes human life. (3) In education, the study of the imagination should make an important contribution to the development of moral persons by not merely conveying information about moral rules or about techniques for solving moral dilemmas, but by shedding light upon the growth of persons who can be sensitive to others and creative in building a home, a neighborhood and a world. THE PROBLEMATIC The discussion of the above issues was directed toward identifying the dimensions of the problematic of the overall project.<query> what is the importance of imagination in education</query> There is a new sense of the person, of freedom and of responsibility. Though it took centuries and even millennia for its implications to unfold, the incarnation and redemption have constituted the basic vision for the development of human self-understanding in Christian cultures. This has affected not only their religious self-understanding, but their sense of person and government, and their sense of nature and industry. In this light one can understand the fact that today large numbers of persons are taking up Christianity in Africa and South Korea. As they transform their total life in the process of modernization, these new interpersonal relations calmly evoke the deeper sense of person and community which originally undergird their developments and constituted their natural basis. Older tribal or communitarian foundations are no longer sufficient; people are led quite naturally to enrich their earlier traditions with new elements from Christianity (see papers of G. McLean and Yang Fenggang).<query> why is christianity important in africa</query> This is not a matter of foreign imposition, but an integrating factor in their free transformation of our lives. In this it will be important to face two issues. The first is the tendency to think of culture in national terms and of religion in individual terms. This would appear to reflect the individualism and fideism especially characteristic of Anglo-Saxon cultures according to which it is the individual that is real and relations to others and religion are simply matters of the heart. One needs to enlarge this vision in order to understand the person in his or her fully communitarian dimensions, not to mention as a denizen of the cosmos. Further, one needs to understand faith not simply as a matter of the heart, but as our integrating commitment before God and, hence, before all his creatures as the basic formative factor for our life with others in this world.<query> what is the difference between religion and culture</query> For this reason it is the basis of our culture and is shaped by the creativity of our imagination as a people. This points to a number of subissues. If our capacity to communicate has been intensified, how is it that people find themselves so isolated? Could it be that the modes of mass communication do not correspond to the level of our personal enjoyment and free commitment? If so, the illusion of free interchange of meaning — when in fact this is but information or entertainment — leaves us only partially alive and radically without meaningful interchange with others. In this light one might also reconsider the Kantian axiom that the higher the ethic, the more universal its laws. This leads some to reject norms or their formulations which are particular to a people in favor of formulations which apply indifferently to all.<query> why is the kantian axiom universal</query> Unfortunately, this can tend to direct peoples’ attention away from the wealth of experience and creativity developed over the centuries as being somehow unworthy of the person in these more highly rationalized times. As a result the emphasis shifts from passionate commitment to cerebral understanding, from real to notional assent, from the rich and subtle forms of interchange of a people to less responsive and more formal or legal structures of human action. In these days of ever greater interaction, we need to be able to take account of the deep significance of the modalities of each culture in order that the pattern of world communication be a full and free engagement of all, rather than a standardizing abstract rationalization. This is important for comprehending the ever increasing interest in Christianity in Africa and Asia. It is important that the sense of incarnation, redemption and resurrection integral to the Christian message and the resulting evolution of the sense of personal freedom in private and public life do not substitute or constitute additions overlaid upon the African and Asian cultures.<query> why is it important to understand the deep significance of each culture?</query> Rather, in the terms of the Gospels, they come as leaven which evokes the corresponding factors in those unique cultures to their own proper development for these new times. RELIGIOUS GROWTH AND THE IMAGINATION Growth in our awareness of the psychological dynamics at work in the development of a person makes it possible to chart some understanding of the sense of the divine in one’s life. This can be related to one’s earliest experiences in infancy as the primary caregiver inspires a sense of openness and trust, rather than of defensiveness which, in turn, would engender a tendency to manipulation. Psychologically, the limitation of the caregiver in conjunction with this sense of trust directs one to a point of unlimited perfection. The form of this needs to be filled in from the qualities of the persons one encounters or the cultural vision supplied in stories, fables, pictures, etc.<query> what is the relationship between the caregiver and the caregiver</query> From all of this, the child is called upon imaginatively to construct his or her own image of God. This process probably is not unilinear and continuous. Radical shifts are possible at transforming moments which consist primarily in leaps of the imagination when our prior worldview breaks down and we engender whole new ways of looking at life. Fowler’s stages of religious development suggest a certain progression in which this might take place as a process of imaging the ultimate context or environment in which we live and engage socially with others. This would place our faith development as foundational. The degree to which we trust determines the way in which we live with others; our internal world shapes our morality. The moral imagination in developing symbols and models for life plays a key role in mediating these two. It articulates our more basic attitudes of sympathy and concern; this reflects the Biblical stories but in ways that are properly our own.<query> what is the role of the imagination in religious development</query> This indeed is to create our personal story. The fact that each one’s image of God is not simply received but imaginatively constructed suggests the importance of a number of factors. The first is that it is crucial to generate a sense of trust in the infant: for this, care in the first stages of life is centrally important. Continuous with this is the importance in the family of examples of fully open, unstinting and unconditional love. In immediate, comprehensible and deeply sensed ways, this mirrors or points to the transcendent absolute love that is God. Second, having introduced the personal psychological dynamics of the child, it becomes possible to see how this could become confused or disoriented during the many unsettling transitions through which the child must pass during his or her development. This sheds light on the roles of education and counseling.<query> why is it important to create a personal story</query> Education will not consist so much in providing the child with an image of God as in suggesting through images and stories materials with which the child can construct his or her own image of God and of his or her relations thereto. In the face of psychological tensions which can disrupt or disorient this process, it can be expected that the child may need personal attention and counseling by someone who is professionally alert to the problems that can arise or to the possibilities which can be opened. Thirdly, it is essential not to confuse the psychological dynamics with the content of the religious vision; that is, there is need to avoid a psychological reductionism. Just as the process of measuring and charting a reef is not the same as constructing one, to an even greater degree our process of imaging God does not constitute but reveals him.<query> what is the importance of psychological therapy</query> It is crucial in these matters to remember that God is precisely the transcendent to whom we can relate, but which we cannot manipulate or shape: it is not we who first loved Him, but He who first loved us. If this is not clear then we are speaking not about God and religion, but about ourselves only. Thus, the growth of our relation to God is not identical to, but only isomorphic with, the psychological dynamics which we can trace in our personal growth. RELIGIOUS GROWTH: TRANSCENDING THE IMAGINATION This is brought out with great clarity in the Hindu religious vision. The ground of all reality is the one Absolute whose life is Bliss (ananda). This is not constituted by us; rather, the realization of our life must be in terms of this Bliss. In this light the psychological process of growth is not one of constituting a distinctive reality after the manner of an Aristotelian substance asautos or of a Freudian ego.<query> what is the transcendental perspective of growth</query> Quite the contrary, it is through sacrifice and renunciation, that is, precisely as cessation of insistence upon our separateness that we are able to live ever more fully in the One and, hence, realize that Bliss which is existence and truth. The road to this might be one of developing consciousness or unfolding love, but it leads not to developing but to dissolving the ego in order that the Absolute Self might be all in all. This suggests a new and deeper sense of many points of current concern. Social concern with alienation and exploitation need to be more deeply and correctly understood than at present. Now they appear as contrasting sides of the same false coin made of a focus upon oneself in contrast to all others and an understanding of that self in terms of the things one produces and possesses. When these are withheld, one is alienated from one’s very self and exploited by others.<query> what is the social concern with alienation</query> If imagination were to be taken as a process of fantasizing, of dreaming and of developing utopia which are arbitrary and unrelated to the real needs of people, it could distract from the urgent needs of the times. Thus, participants from China, Africa and South America were careful to cast a realistic, in contrast to an idealistic, orientation for the discussion. The study must begin from the realities of the present. This, however, made the question of what is real, particularly in the human order, of central importance. Were one to consider it to be simply that which appears to the senses, as Engels had held, then technological reason would suffice. One would be blinded to the properly human mode of life and its realm of freedom, to the way in which human associations are freely created and to the search for personal and social fulfillment.<query> what is real in the human order</query> A solution to this can come not from simply shifting possessions from one greedy and possessive class to another, but only from a deep change of vision and of heart. This is a change from possessiveness to renunciation, from myself against all others to an open sense of self in which all are one, and from single-minded pursuit of profit to concern that physical goods be made to serve all peoples. This implies a shift from class revolutions to renunciation; it looks to religious imagination for the basis upon which social justice and harmony can be built. THE ROLE OF THE IMAGINATION IN RELIGIOUS RITUAL One might distinguish theological and anthropological approaches to this issue. The former is concerned with the world behind the text: what the ceremony is supposed to do or accomplish. This is very important in Christian ritual which is built upon the incarnation and, hence, upon the introduction of a fully transcendent divine Person into time.<query> what is the role of imagination in religious ritual</query> As this can be done only by God Himself, the rituals must be traced in some way to Christ rather than to the Christian community alone, and proportionately to the Christian community as the Body of Christ in time rather than to the individual alone or to one’s subjective feelings. In this context, special attention is given to the realization of the ritual after the manner of the prescriptions as derived from some transcending source. It would, of course, be an exaggeration to attend to the commonly prescribed ritual factors alone, with no attention to the elements of personal involvement. Indeed, in other Christian sacramental circumstances, such as marriage and the sacrament of reconciliation, the lack of such personal engagement would simply nullify the sacrament. Hence, in the Christian Eucharist the element of subjectivity would appear not so much to be absent or indifferent as overshadowed by the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ Himself.<query> what is the purpose of the eucharist</query> In this regard an anthropological comparison to the Iroquois ceremony of thanksgiving is helpful in bringing out very important dimensions of religion as human action. First of all, the overall context and intent of the ceremony is to give thanks not merely as a single event intersecting time, but as expressing the whole of life as a process of thanksgiving. The Iroquois come together in order, not merely to give thanks in a separate act, but to remind each other that they need tobe thankful, to live thankfully. In this regard the wording is important. Its mode is that of a performative: it carries out what it is describing. Its grammatical form expresses continuing action: not merely ""we thank you for it,"" but ""we are thanking you for it."" It is as if time itself was stopped in order that the meaning of life which is lived through time might emerge.<query> why is the iroquois thanksgiving important</query> Hence, during the days of the ceremony no other activities of any real importance take place. Everything stops for this act, which is not a matter of doing or saying things but of symbolizing, expressing or freeing the possibilities of life, which itself is the mystery. Beneath its words and actions, the ceremony is set in the lives of the people as regulating and expressing feelings which must be there beforehand. Hence, the words need not be carefully or even quite completely said. What is important is that the ritual leader come from the people, that in the ritual event he or she express their real feelings, and that thereby the time between the events be defined. The ceremony is then an expression of the deep sentiments and beliefs of the group as a whole. What should this be called? Some would speak of a ""collective unconscious,"" but it may not be quite appropriate to call it ""unconscious"" if in fact it is the root inspiration and orientation of the whole conscious life.<query> what is the purpose of a ritual</query> Indeed, ""belief"" might be a better term if this implies not arbitrariness but commitment. In that light the term ""collective"" also needs interpretation, for if it were to mean the impersonal character of contemporary ideologies, then it would not express the intensive sense of community experienced in the tribe. Perhaps the use of the term ""collective unconscious"" in this context reflects more on an individualistic empiricism on the part of the one who employs the term, rather than on the character of the foundational commitment of participants in tribal life. The same may be true of descriptions of the events in terms of the power of mass suggestion. Totalitarian efforts at mind control do not enliven one’s freedom but deaden it. This is quite different from the days of peacefully and joyously entering into themselves for the thanksgiving ceremony in which people reaffirm their basic sensibilities and commitments.<query> what is collective unconscious</query> The people of India have a rich tradition in this regard to which they have given the most sedulous attention. They are very conscious of the ability to open different levels of the psyche within and even above us, the great power that this generates and its ability to overcome great obstacles. At the same time, they distinguish such engagements which perfect man from destructive and even pathological engagements. The same can be said of much simpler cults developed in various parts of the world. Most are created by simple people; though some more sophisticated groups are engaged in others. They differ from folk religion in that they are not simply imaginative modes of expressing religious feelings, namely, those which relate man to the transcendent as such. Rather, they are attempts to manipulate higher powers in the service of mankind, often for good — but at times even for evil — purposes.<query> what is the difference between folk religion and cult</query> Certainly all that man puts his head to can be done well or poorly, and self-seeking can pervert even religious activities. But, one cannot for that reason cease any and all human activities. What is important in religious ceremonies is that they open us as human persons beyond ourselves toward that which transcends us, that they set our life in a context not of myopic selfishness and viciousness toward others, but of unity and brotherhood, truth and justice, love and reconciliation. In searching for God, religion is a search for the high meaning of human life. In our rationalized and graphic urban society, there is a danger that we may lose the creativity of the religious imagination which was shown by those who lived more consciously in a symbol system. In one sense, this corresponds to a certain sense of pluralism, i.e., a willingness to allow all to have their own traditions and to learn from them.<query> why is religion important</query> On the other hand, there may be some danger that this will reflect less on a positive evaluation of others than on a lessening of seriousness about deeper dimensions of meaning. If our religious experiences are our peak experiences and if these are specific to our religion, then what evolves in these must be radically important and make a difference. On this basis, hermeneutics would suggest that, rather than a lessening of sensitivity to one’s own tradition, thereby giving access to others, it is just the opposite: it is when we are more fully aware of what we are and on what basis we exist that we can hope to appreciate the importance and the nature of the horizons of others. LITERATURE AND THE SEARCH FOR THE ABSOLUTE From the time of Adam, through Milton’s Paradise Lost, to Sartre’s analysis of basic human dynamics, it has been observed wisely that man wants to be God.<query> what is hermeneutics</query> The thrust of transcendence by which mankind pushes beyond the level of brute animals, reaches out toward others and attempts to direct the universe bespeaks a deep-seated drive of spirit which can be truly fulfilled only in divine life itself. This is the power and the glory of mankind. Paradoxically, it can also become a human weakness and even its squalor. French intellectuals have always been particularly sensitive to this fact. For them, power implies a reach for control and thereby a threat of oppression. This has been not only a fictive juxtaposition of the mind, but the bitter experience of the repeated subversion by kings, emperors and führers of attempts to live the ideals of freedom. The French have experienced this twice in this century in the form of German occupation; for them it is symbolized by the holocaust. This has largely controlled discussion in French intellectual circles, which it has directed somewhat compulsively toward the confrontation of a distinctive issue of modern life.<query> what is the power of the french</query> Elsewhere the growth of material affluence and consumerism may have so dissipated the drive toward transcendence that the issue is how this thrust can be recaptured and reaffirmed. In France, on the contrary, there has been a special fear that this urge will so fascinate mankind as to generate oppression and the ultimate suppression of all that is truly human. The situation is extremely delicate and volatile, even explosive; the very realization of the life of people precisely as human depends upon its adequate resolution. Three routes have been attempted. The first is that of Heidegger: much contemporary debate on this issue is carried out in terms of interpreting and/or reinterpreting his attempt to direct attention to being itself, rather than to beings. If metaphysics is regarded, as in Hegel, as a comprehensive system of beings, then this shift of its goal by Heidegger would constitute a rejection of metaphysics.<query> what is the issue of transcendence</query> Attention was turned precisely toward these latter dimensions and to the role of the imagination therein. It was suggested that the center for the ordering of social reality is, in fact, the imagination. On the macro-level it was the exercise of the imagination at the time of the enlightenment, for example, which began to envisage an order which has gradually come to be articulated through the various social and political struggles and to develop more adequate national structures throughout the world. This was illustrated by the development of an American identity which, though based upon European cultures, is not reducible thereto. This suggests that with the emerging sense of pluralism what is important is not merely a correct translation of tradition, but an understanding of the ways in which the imaginative can reorder materials in order to form the foundational symbols that order our life.<query> what is the role of imagination in social order</query> If however, if it is taken as a search to uncover being itself, then Heidegger’s work is a new and important continuation of the metaphysical quest. For our question, it is more important to ask not about the nature of the shift but about its purpose: what was he attempting to do? Was his shift from beings to being an attempt to break the fascination of the human mind with beings and their structures? Concretely was it an effort to free the mind from the fascist and Marxist structures of power experienced so bitterly in this century? Though some would see it in this light, they are concerned that Heidegger tarried too long with the fascination, that he shared for too long the hopes of many of his contemporaries that the structures of National Socialism could constitute a new and decent order. Indeed, they fear that for those who inadequately differentiate being and beings, the recognition of an absolute character for the former provides a basis for the absolutization of the latter.<query> what was heidegger's purpose</query> They worry lest the enthusiastic attention given to Heidegger by those redeveloping the notion of the person in the period since World War II become the basis of a renewed fascism, a new Nietzschean nightmare. As a result a second deconstructionist route has been undertaken which in part attempts to remove any hold on being, even for the person in society. One should, it suggests, abandon the search for meaning and ideals begun with Socrates and Plato and turn rather to a Democratean chance interplay of atoms. In this man is no longer the constructor of his physical or social cosmos, but a single thrust of self-affirmation and/or self-preservation in a chaotic universe. This is the prototypical reductionism in which all is derivative from a single set of minimal particles. The person who recognizes no absolutes, it is thought, can do no harm.<query> what is the deconstructionist route</query> But could the opposites not be even more true? The one who refuses to recognize any transcendent and attempts to suppress the thrust thereto would appear to be denying that which always has been considered essential to the person: such a depersonalization of life could not but be the greatest violence to the person. Further, if there is but an atomistic interplay of forces then life is essentially marked by violence, and only force makes right. In this manner the classical French fear that power oppresses would be realized in fact. In the face of fascism some French writers such as Gaston Bataille earlier followed a third route. Fearing the demonic attraction of the ego to draw all to itself and constitute what has been referred to as an ""ipsi ,"" a primary self, lording it over others, their response was to put things in words in order to renounce the tendency to exclusiveness and domination.<query> who wrote fear of power oppresses</query> This has similarities to such mystics as John of the Cross who passed through personal self-negation (the dark night of the soul) to a new liberation and freedom. For them unity was radical questioning of all that constituted any finite reality as absolute and thereby stunted the free expansion of being. This echoes some essential elements of Hindu — especially Advaitin — thought which according to theGita stresses the need for renunciation in action. This is not a cessation of action, but a recognition that one must look beyond the particular beings or structures to the Fullness of Being, which should be reflected through the unity and harmony of all. In this one hears also echoes of Confucius. Further, if it is important to bring all into a harmony that reflects the absolute, then a purely negative stance toward the transcendence may not be enough.<query> what is unity in hinduism</query> (In the classical sense, thevia negativa without the via affirmativa has neither foundation nor meaning.) Recognition of a Transcendent that can free man from enslavement to anything limited and limiting requires not only the negation of limitation, but the affirmation of positive perfection. The challenge is to be able to make this affirmation without the supreme presumption of pretending to be or to control the Absolute. This combination of affirmation and negation — or affirmation in humility — is called adoration. DIALOGUE V. THE IMAGINATION IN SOCIAL LIFE VALUES AND THE POLITICAL IMAGE In The American Presidency Phillip Rossiter identifies six roles of the American Presidency: chief of state, chief of government, commander-in-chief, chief diplomat, chief legislator and chief of party. However, in assessing the performance of individual presidents and in evaluating each role separately, the degree of success of a president does not appear to correspond to the degree of his general popularity.<query> what is the role of the president in the american presidency</query> President Reagan’s relatively poor performance in four of these roles, for example, is overshadowed by his very high overall popularity, and something similar could be said of President Kennedy. This directs attention to another, deeper level in order to comprehend the place of the American president in the life of the people. The millennia of emperors and kings provided no examples of a presidency. That was a typical part of the enlightenment vision of political power, emerging from the people and being invested in a person chosen to lead according to a founding constitution. It was the serendipitous fulfillment of the sense of providential mission which inspired the minds and hearts of the original settlers who left Europe in search of new social, economic and religious freedoms. George Washington exemplified the idea quite well and expressed these aspirations of the people in the words of his public, inaugural and farewell addresses as the First President and Commander-in-chief.<query> what was the role of the president during the enlightenment</query> Ever after, the president would be not merely the chief of government, but the ""chief priest"" of American ""civil"" religion. Thus, though Americans may be aware of serious failures in the execution of some or even most particular roles, that is, in what a president does, nonetheless, they may approve highly of a president with a strong sense of who he is, of the identity of the country he embodies and expresses, and, hence, who is successful in evoking the cohesion, commitment and energy of the people. The president must give meaning and hope to life, for it is he who moves and binds together the nation. This directs our attention to a number of important roles played by imagination in democratic leadership. These might be surveyed in terms of the dictum that ""myths are dreams fulfilled in our aspirations."" First, political power in a democracy might be seen above all as ""myth."" Democracy is not formulated simply of irrational material or economic forces or is the imposition of an imperial will upon the people.<query> what is the role of the president in a democracy</query> It is, rather, what the people create by their ability to communicate and cooperate in delineating the exercise of the power they possess as a community and which they invest in the presidency. The president then is more than a scientific formula, for it is not a matter of merely automatic, predefined actions or responses. Rather, it is the embodiment of the freedom of a people which can be exercised only in ever new and imaginative ways. But the president remains the creation of the people and, hence, at times experiences with amazement not only the power, but also the limitations of the office as this is shaped politically by the people. Secondly, to say that myths are ""dreams"" bespeaks also of the transcendence of the presidency over present concrete reality and even over the cumulation of historical events. For this transcendence, the president must look back both to the Biblical imagery which shaped the self-identity and sense of mission of the original settlers and to the religious bases of the rights and aspirations of the people (the God-given character of the rights of ""life, liberty and pursuit of happiness"") as articulated in the founding documents of the country.<query> what is the meaning of the term president</query> But, the president must look forward as well; he must envisage new ways of responding in times of danger and of progressing in times of peace. Thus, the office of president has increasingly assumed the role of ""chief architect"" of the nation. At times of celebration and crises, the president is expected to unfold the meaning of the American dream in ever new and imaginative ways. Thirdly, if myths are fulfilled in the ""aspirations"" of the people, then mere expressions of reason and understanding will not suffice; will and passion, also, are required. Thus, the president must be able to express, inspire and enliven the people with the power of the dream. He must be able to move them beyond the selfish concerns which shatter a people into warring factions and open up inclusive concerns for neighbors in ever broader terms which reach beyond ""me"" and ""my group"" to others in the broader society and, indeed, to other peoples of the world.<query> what is the role of the president</query> The religious rootedness of the culture in God as Father of all can provide an essential basis for this. But the challenge for a people is to live up to the implications of such foundations, embracing them in heart as well as in mind, that is, as values in terms of which the nation’s life will be lived. Here, the president serves both as ""priest"" and as ""prophet,"" giving voice to the best that is in the heart of the culture and evoking the response of goodwill. If this is the character of political leadership, then it must be asked whether politics, as a science carried out in terms of a liberal or socialist ideology, has the necessary dimensions to appreciate the role of the presidency: to paraphrase, could the presidency be too important to be left to political science?<query> what is the role of the president in the presidency</query> In this sense, too, attention must be given to the role of ideology. This can be taken in a positive sense as it defines what a people, and especially a set of peoples and cultures within a single nation, have in common in their effort to replace outmoded structures by new ones more adapted to their times. In this sense, the level of development of a people may depend more upon what they have in their minds and hearts than in their hands — as illustrated by Japan. Conversely, the role of the imagination in developing an ideology can be perverted into creating instruments of illusion and even suppression. In this process, a study of the dialectic of ideological development can be of use. If in this area ontogeny follows phylogeny, and if each stage both repeats and negates its predecessor, which in turn stands in a similar relation to its predecessors, then a sophisticated logic might help us with a scientific analysis of the formal constants in cultural growth.<query> what is the role of ideology in cultural development</query> On the other hand, it might be feared that this factor of myth might distract one from reality, thereby, resulting in losing touch with real needs and not assiduously working on the concrete tasks that must be accomplished. This, indeed, was a main reason proposed by William James in his opening lecture on Pragmatism in Faneuil Hall at the turn of the century. Worse still, can myth develop aspirations greater than can ever be fulfilled and, hence, in time inevitably undermine political leadership? Must then one lose one’s identity in order to progress, or can the converse be true? In approaching the issue it should be noted that even people who were damaged economically by President Reagan’s policies responded enthusiastically to him for giving voice to their identity and values. This suggests that the life of a people, precisely as free, consists above all in its sense of identity and its aspirations.<query> why is myth important</query> They are not — and they deeply fear becoming or being treated as — the product of unconscious market or power mechanisms; as a free people their primary engagement is the direction of their freedom. Their myths could be good and helpful, even if not fully lived up to; they could be good, but subject to manipulation; or they could be good, but not good enough. The history of a people might be said to consist primarily in the process of imaginatively shaping myths by which they are moved to shape their physical, social and economic environments and according to which they measure their success. Hence, a people’s myth should not be considered only synchroniously as something which always has been or which develops merely cumulatively. The work of political leadership in acting out the myth of the roots of a people is crucial to the stability of its identity and for the development of the institutions and values by which they live.<query> what is the myth of the roots of a people</query> In addition, their myths must inspire the diachronic factors of adaptation, change and progress. The presidency must apply the myth in new ways and create new myths or sanction them in the name of the people so that the people can adjust in times of rapid change. Here, imagination plays the central role. Perhaps the key to the presidency lies in the relation between a nation’s myth(s) and its executive power. Is it healthy to identify in the same person both the myth and political power? Constitutional monarchies separate the two, leaving the symbolic functions to a queen or king and vesting the executive powers in a prime minister. As a result, the mythic level of basic national allegiances is not involved in the daily running of the country. The question is complex with many factors militating in both directions. It would appear to be up to the genius of a free people to work this out in their own way.<query> what is the role of the president in the mythic realm</query> Their solution, in turn, becomes part of the culture of that people. It is their gift to subsequent generations and can be drawn upon by other peoples to the degree that they find this helpful in their own process of nation building. In any case, a people must avoid twin extremes. One is the degeneration of the national myth into a shallow caricature. For example, the rugged individualism which made it possible to conquer the American West must not be allowed to be manipulated either by oneself or by others into a selfish individualism that justifies a lack of care for, or even vicious attacks upon, others. Such struggles between good and evil must be fought continually and won within every person and people. In this information age, the powerful tools of mass communication and manipulation make the task of interpreting national myth an increasingly constant preoccupation of a people, as can be seen in the efforts to form a national approach to abortion.<query> what is the role of the national myth</query> This process of relating this to such basic national values as freedom (of ""choice"") and human ""rights"" is not left only to the Supreme Court; the perceptions of the Court are prepared by intensive efforts to shape the perceptions of the people. It is here that the mind and heart of a people is forged. At the other extreme is the development of political power divorced from the myth and of the values of the people convened thereby. This subjects a people simply to the arbitrary will of the person or group that wields power or to the still less personal forces of market or military balance. This, too, has been the terrible experience of our times. The effort of peoples in all regions to free themselves from this oppression is the central human struggle of our times. Does this mean that we are now more oppressed or more aware of freedom?<query> what is the development of political power divorced from the myth and of the values of the people Could it be that in the new information age both of these can be true and that the combination makes the work of the imagination simultaneously more possible, more difficult, more crucially needed and more potentially rewarding? If so, it is the ""high stakes"" game of our times. In this light, avoiding the extremes, power is wedded to values and human goals; and values can be formed by power in order for those goals to be truly realized; this is the work of a free people in our day. IMAGINATION, MYTH MAKING AND THE EVOLUTION OF REVOLUTIONS The process of sociopolitical evolution manifests three major stages according principally to the mode of production, that is, to the systemic unity of productive forces and relations of production. These three stages are: the agricultural which has long been established and in many places already is past; the industrial which is still being developed in some places while in others it already is passing away; and the information stage which is now beginning.<query> what is the process of sociopolitical evolution</query> Because the forces of production cannot account for all the dynamics of the social realm, Marx distinguished between the basis and the superstructure, which includes culture, opinion information and education. These latter emerge as the seat of power or domination in the information age. In any one of these three stages, the mode of production can be either democratic or despotic. Things become unbalanced when one sector in the relations of production gains so much power, size or preeminence that it interferes with the forces of production (e.g., if the military sector becomes too large it can unduly reduce the work force and restrict production). The emergence and finally the domination of one group over the others appears to be a natural process which intensifies gradually until it spawns a revolution. Unfortunately, however, as the new equalization or equilibrium also is subject to the same dynamics a new dominant group develops and a new revolution becomes necessary, and so on and on.<query> what is the mode of production</query> By applying the principle that ontogeny follows phylogeny it is possible to understand and respond to the mechanism of this process in greater detail. The principles mean that any subsequent stage includes as well the negation which characterized the earlier stage, which in turn includes the negation of its predecessor, etc. A revolutionary history becomes also an analytic chart for understanding the present dynamics, the steps which must occur and how one can best react thereto. Thus, in analyzing present socialist regimes one is able to find the remnants of the absolutization of the leader which had characterized the level of slavery, as well as the absolute dominion over the means of production by the administrative class which had characterized the feudal state. Can one hope for a change from such a bureaucratic absolutism in the new information age? Reasons can be cited both for and against.<query> what is the principle of ontogeny following phylogeny</query> On the one hand, hope can be found in the very nature of information and technology. Because information is located on the level of superstructure (which some would consider to be not matter, but spirit), it is not subject to being absolutely and exclusively possessed and, hence, to being exercised in an arbitrary manner. Indeed in an information and technological age, the effects of wrong decisions are more penetrating, immediate and widespread (not to discount the tens of millions who have been killed by the implications of such military and political power). In a world of large populations, sophisticated technology and complex structures, misguided economic, productive, environmental and even educational decisions soon become manifest and call urgently for redress. In this way the arbitrariness of leaders is circumscribed, for they must share their power with others inasmuch as the technical capabilities of teams of specialists are required for proper decision making In contrast to the industrial age which concentrated capital and, therefore, power in the hands of a very few, in the information age power is intellectual and, hence, inherently social.<query> what is the effect of the information age</query> As a closed society cannot but fall behind in a technological era, the need to introduce communications technology is itself liberating. Thus, survival and the socialization of information have become so linked as to impose the latter even upon the unwilling. On the other hand, though the industrial revolution had the equalizing effect of breaking down class barriers, it did not really empower the workers, but reduced them to an undifferentiated mass under an absolute leader and a faceless, bureaucratic apparatus. The myth of the absolute leader was created, regarding whom no criticism was allowed. By eliminating all negative feedback, this created a cybernetic blindness in which the system could not but lose its way. Worse still, the minds of the people were positively manipulated by this blind leadership, thereby assuring that the disorientation of the nation would be total.<query> what was the effect of the industrial revolution</query> However, the issue may be deeper than one of political ideologies and formal social structures, even if these be well-directed. For if the person is not only a citizen and, hence, is not able to be understood exclusively in terms of the political order, then the imagination has deeper roots and a richer task. Thus, for example, the founding documents of the American republic speak of God-given rights and values to be respected by the newly emerging political structures; indeed, the promotion of those values is the raison d’être of the political structures. Similarly, the long, as well as the recent, experience of the Polish people shows how a sense of communion can provide the foundational context of a people’s life despite the circumstances of military, political and economic repression. The power of an ideology with all modern means at its disposal and absolute control to submerge all into an undifferentiated society becomes more questionable the longer it is attempted.<query> what is the raison d'être of political structures</query> In this situation groups lost their identity and all shared in false consciousness. The result was to bring out the worst in people, to generate such disillusionment that they came to resist any positive input regarding socially oriented steps, and to consider their vote as a mechanical process with no relation to a personal and, hence, a free decision. The budding democratic hopes were soon extinguished. In addition, the technology of this information age proved to be a powerful tool for manipulating the minds of peoples. The image makers fashion the new leaders, from the words they utter to the way in which their hair is combed. These creators of images are few and can be paid and empowered by even fewer. Finally, the difference in native intellectual capacity and its selective development through education and ideology assures that power in an information age will remain structured, selective and highly oriented.<query> what is the result of the information age</query> Despite the extensiveness of education, the truly directive class will remain a small elite. Indeed, we are in danger of being subjected not only to another bureaucratic elite, but to one with even more inescapable and intrusive power — the haunting image is that of George Orwell’s ""1984."" If mythomania already exists, one trembles to imagine what it can become with the burgeoning capabilities of the information age. This pathology could have multiple levels. For Eastern Europe, some would relate it historically to the aristocratic traditions distinctive of the Russian people. If this be so, then the emergence of the other ethnic groups in the U.S.S.R. could be seen as a source of socializing cultural elements and, hence, a promising corrective force. Others would suggest that the pathology is characteristic of socialism understood as a system which places society before person.<query> what is pathology in russia</query> In this light, socialism would be inherently antidemocratic (and commonly restricting free speech, free association and free market) and at times despotic. This view would reject any prospect of a convergence of socialism with liberal democracy. Still others, would consider the pathology of absolute power to be more subtle and widespread, citing its presence as well in the oligarchies of Latin America and in the combined financial and political power of multinational businesses. When this is traced more deeply into the ideologies of power, claims begin to appear hidden under validity claims, and ideology is seen to constitute an inescapable cognitive loop within which all human effort to change reality is blunted, assimilated and dissipated. An ideology may eliminate its critics or make minor adjustments, but always in terms of preserving its identity and that of its power structure. Finally, some would ask whether treating the question on the structural level may not be insufficient or even harmful.<query> what is the pathology of absolute power</query> Historically, it would seem that the desire to change structures has always resulted in a new form of despotism. This may suggest that human freedom is on a different level from formal structures. If so, it could be understood that attempts to heal the cooperative or social exercise of human freedom solely through structural reorganization may be doomed to frustration, if not disaster. If structures taken in isolation are alienating, then the dilemma becomes how to institutionalize deinstitutionalization and how to do this over and over again until it is recognized that such works of technical reason are simply inappropriate because they are manipulative and antifree. Indeed, the information age is just the situation in which Habermas’ work begins, namely, a society awash in information, subject to technical reason and, hence, to manipulation. He works toward a participational process for working out a free social order.<query> what is the problem with structural reorganization</query> H.G. Gadamer would carry this process even further by looking into tradition for the values according to which such work could be directed and judged and for the shared social commitments which would give the inspiration, hopes and goals in terms of which it might be undertaken. In this light, we come to see the need to imagine new nonmanipulative forms of social life in which the members are true participants whom the leadership accompanies rather than directs. The Biblical imagery of shepherd and of leaven reemerge, with both ancient and modern meaning. Myth and imagination becomes particularly important in enabling us to integrate past elements and envisage an alternate future. Thus, while some myths may set boundaries which restrict and manipulate, others can serve precisely to take us beyond past limitations. Durkheim did a typology of myth according to social forms, and inIn Religion as Cultural System Clifford Geertz has described ways in which religion can serve as a model not only of, but for, society.<query> what is the importance of myths</query> If the process of myth and symbol making is a work of human creativity, this does not mean, however, that it is not grounded in reality or that it is any less necessary for free social life. Thus some would point out that the inviolable dignity of the person and the appropriateness of correspondingly unrestricted care and concern by others is as primary as a mother’s care of her infant and as primordial as tribal life. These basic truths are never distant or unknown. Each people elaborates them according to their own experience and creativity in national symbols and religious myths. Their strength has borne up peoples such as the Jews and Poles, by which they have been able to survive for centuries despite the full weight of aggressive, human oppression. If freedom could be eliminated by an administrative absolutism, this would have taken place long ago.<query> what is the meaning of myths and symbols</query> If it cannot be, then it may hold the power to humanize the structures — but only if we have the imagination to wield it creatively. THE EVOLUTION OF REVOLUTIONS: THE AFRICAN EXPERIENCE Three factors appear important here: the nature and role of ideology, the nature of revolutions and the role of socialism as a means of change. Ideology is a discourse which directs political life toward particular objectives. In order to calculate clearly in this field, one needs to focus not only on ideals but also on criteria. One’s sense of ideology would consider it to be a reductionist univocal and, hence, destructive of freedom and creativity. Other senses would be more open. To speak of democratic socialism as an ideology would be precisely to emphasize the openness of the political horizon to multiple views and free innovation so that all views can be presented and can compete for public adherence and support.<query> what is the role of ideology in the american revolution</query> The term ""revolution"" has many meanings. As with all human affairs, it can be banalized, romantic posturing and/or employed in manipulating populations. Basically, however, it expresses liberation from various forms of domination both from without and within, whether slave owners, monarchical, colonial, capitalist or totalitarian of the left or the right. Two major problems arise with regard to any such great change. One problem is that in the novelty of the resulting situation, with its implied lack of traditions for shaping people’s tolerances and for inspiring social generosity, some might manipulate the public order to the advantage of a special group, thereby creating a new tyranny. The other problem is that the revolution might simply respond to the pressures of the previous regime, leading to its destruction, but without the conditions, the vision or the means for developing a viable successor.<query> what is the problem with a revolution</query> This could introduce a level of instability or even of anarchy which would render impossible any progress or even the maintenance of the population. From this it follows that prior to change — a fortiori prior to a change so basic as to be called a revolution — it is necessary to have a plan or vision in the second and open sense of the term ""ideology"" above. As components, this should improve upon the discoveries and developments of modern times. Hence, it would be unrealistic to think of a modern state without the operation of a capital market, permitted to operate freely in order to integrate the personal initiative and creativity of all sectors of its population. In addition, it should integrate also the modern contribution of socialism. In Africa this has many models, ranging from systems in which power and ideas grow out of the village level up to other systems compared to others directed from the top down, i.e., from the technologists of the central governing elite to the people.<query> what is the role of the capital market in the modern state</query> The range of socialism, however, seems to share two factors: first, socialism is commonly seen as a program for rapid economic and social development; secondly, it is seen as more morally and humanistically sensitive than the materially oriented concerns of capitalism. Taken in this broad sense, socialism transcends materialism and even the nature of a sociopolitical or economic system. This may make it possible to overcome the seeming contradiction of capitalism and socialism when the latter depends upon public ownership. Socialism becomes, instead, a matter of human consciousness. In view of this, the imagination may be able to develop symbols and myths which enable it imaginatively to reorder such components of our situation as capitalism and socialism and to project new goals, values and structures. This is the basis and prerequisite of any revolution that gives hope of success.<query> what is socialism</query>"

Given the option, would you choose a gooey hot fudge sundae or a granola bar? A double cheeseburger or a double helping of green veggies? For many of us, eating healthy is harder than it sounds, especially when temptations abound.

The SNP Nutrition Guidelines follow Canada’s Food Guide and apply to foods served in programs. Guiding principals for the nutrition guidelines include: promote healthy eating, prepare healthy food, respect diversity and individual needs, contribute to social development, choose Ontario food first, be environmentally conscious and practice safe food handling and storage.

Not only is the availability of healthy foods in schools bound to result in better eating habits and increased concentration levels for students but, perhaps most importantly, by reinforcing the knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding healthy living that are being taught through the revised Ontario Health and Physical Education Curriculum and encouraged by initiatives such as Foundations for a Healthy School, it is sure to send a strong message to students: Healthy eating habits are important... so important, in fact, that we are willing to work hard to ensure that our school environments support us all in making healthier choices.<query> why is healthy eating important in schools</query> View All Articles Post new comment Subject: Comment: * CAPTCHA This question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.

What this means is that choosing nutritious foods more often won’t only be encouraged, it will become an integral part of every school’s culture—something that we at Ophea could not be happier about. “Ophea shares the government’s commitment to healthy schools and healthy communities and believes that Ontario’s new School Food and Beverage Policy is a critical step that will reinforce the philosophy and expectations of the revised H&PE curriculum,” comments Chris Markham, Ophea’s executive director and CEO.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> “It will foster a healthier learning environment and help students reach their full potential.” Good nutrition leads to better health and better learning... It’s simple enough to do the math. With 195 days in a typical school year, Ontario students are eating most of their lunches at school. Whether these lunches are purchased in cafeterias or brought from home and supplemented with snacks from school vending machines, they often include high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium, low nutrient foods such as fries, candy bars and sugary drinks. ""When our school board introduced nutrition standards in 2007, it was because we knew that a healthy diet would lead to more active and engaged students. The results have been outstanding,"" says Roger Lawler, Director of Education at the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. As the link between improved health and improved learning outcomes has been proven time and time again, and the connections between poor nutrition and chronic disease have been well documented, it’s become increasingly clear: poor nutrition is a problem that we, as a society, can no longer afford to ignore, and one that we all have a responsibility not to perpetuate.<query> why is nutrition important in school</query> Furthermore, the need to set a strong example for students by ‘practicing what we preach’ in schools cannot be understated. Through the implementation of Daily Physical Activity (DPA), the forging of community partnerships and the adoption of the Ministry of Education’s Foundations for a Healthy School framework, schools have already begun to take a more comprehensive approach to improving student health. But while positive health messages are taught and physical activity has been made a priority, the foods currently sold in schools often fail to support and reinforce what students are learning about healthy living. It’s time to make a change, and there’s never been a better time to get started! As schools begin to adopt the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum (Grades 1-8)—which not only provides information about health education but also builds students’ capacity to make healthy choices—the new policy will help to ensure greater alignment between what students are being taught and the food choices that are available, helping them to apply what they’re learning while fostering healthy habits that can last a lifetime.<query> why is physical education important in schools</query> The policy applies to all foods sold in schools... The new policy applies to foods and beverages sold on school premises for school purposes including all venues, such as cafeterias, vending machines and tuck shops. It also applies to all programs (for example, catered lunch programs) and must be enforced at all events, including bake sales and sports competitions. Exceptions to the policy will include foods and beverages that are: offered in schools at no cost; brought from home or purchased off school premises; available for purchase during field trips off school premises; sold in schools for non-school purposes (e.g., sold by an outside organization using the school gym after school hours and for non school-related events); sold for fundraising activities that occur off school premises; and sold in staff rooms. Under the policy, school principals may also elect to designate up to 10 days (or fewer as determined by the school board) during the school year as “special-event days” on which foods and beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards may be sold.<query> what is the policy for food sold in schools</query> The healthiest foods have the highest nutritional values... The policy groups foods and beverages into three categories: “The Sell Most Category” must make up at least 80% of choices offered. These foods and beverages generally have higher levels of essential nutrients and lower levels of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples may include fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits and vegetables; and whole grain breads. “The Sell Less Category” must make up no more than 20% of choices offered. These foods have slightly higher amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium than the ‘Sell Most Category.’ Examples may include deli meats, frozen pizza and hotdogs. Foods that are in the “Not Permitted for Sale Category” are generally those that contain few or no essential nutrients and high amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium.<query> what is the sell most category for food</query> Examples include deep fried foods, energy bars and candy. More information about the criteria for determining a food’s suitability can be found inThe School Food & Beverage Policy itself. When it comes to implementation, help is readily available... Throughout the winter of 2010, school board teams and principals will receive training from the Ministry of Education in how to implement the new policy, and further information about implementation support can be found at www.ontario.ca/healthyschools. As with any new policy or initiative, getting started is the hardest part. School boards are encouraged to reach out to students, staff, parents, community partners and food service providers in order to gain their support. School boards should also seek support from their local board of health, as they have been mandated under the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2008 to work with school boards and/or staff in elementary, secondary and post-secondary educational settings, using a comprehensive health promotion approach.<query> what is the ontario school food policy</query> The goal of this collaboration is to influence the development and implementation of healthy policies, and the creation or enhancement of supportive environments to address healthy eating and other key health issues (including physical activity, alcohol use and tobacco control). For more information on working with your local board of health, see www.ophea.net/healthy-schools-communities/making-it-happen/step-3. Schools and communities can also access the following sources for further information and for support for healthy eating: Eat Right Ontario – This is an initiative of the Ministry of Health Promotion. Through this program, schools (or other interested parties) can access a registered dietician by phone or by email to answer any questions they have about healthy eating. Their website, www.eatrightontario.ca, also contains a wealth of information about diabetes prevention, menu planning, and health and nutrition, as well as a listing of healthy recipes.<query> what is the health promotion program for schools</query> Menu of Choices – This online resource, published by Ophea, provides the latest quality information and supports to help school communities understand, plan and address healthy eating. The website, www.menuofchoices.ca, which encourages entire school communities to take a proactive approach to addressing the eating behaviours of children and youth (Grades K-12), can be accessed by all educators and community partners who want to help students develop a personal commitment to healthy eating. Student Nutrition Program (SNP) – This Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) program supports communities to provide nutritious food to children and youth. The program supports the healthy growth and development of children and youth by providing universal access to nutritious meals and snacks at each site so students are ready to learn. SNP is a community-driven initiative. The service delivery model is designed to encourage and facilitate community participation in the development and implementation of the program at the local level so programs can be tailored to meet the individual needs of local children, youth and families.<query> what is snp</query>"

Workmen's Mu tual Fire Insurance Society, New York, completed its 65th year of continuous operation with 67,800 members, assets of $1,120,000 and $85,900,000 worth of in surance in force. Two years ago the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Cooperative Association began operations. Nineteen thirty-seven found it serving ten county-wide cooperatives, business was 86% ahead of last year and' driving steadily toward an annual busi ness of a million dollars. 21 Special Events of 1937 In a year studded with important de velopments these were some of the most outstanding events: The report of the Inquiry on Coopera tive Enterprise in Europe was presented to President Roosevelt in April after the six-man commission had spent almost a year in its preparation.<query> what year did the pa farm bureau begin</query> To date no of ficial action has been taken. The Congress of the International Co operative Alliance in Paris, attended by 10 American delegates, clarified the Rochdale Principles: created an interna tional organization of cooperative youth and took action to set up an office of the International Cooperative Wholesale Society in London. Edward A. Filene, Boston merchant and father of the credit union movement in the US, who a year earlier set up Con sumer Distribution Corporation with as sets of $1,000,000 to organize a chain of cooperative department stores, died in Paris a few days after the close of the ICA Congress. Anders Hedberg, executive of the Co operative Union of Sweden, and Sydney Elliott, Editor of the British cooperative Sunday newspaper Reynold's News, toured the American cooperatives under the auspices of The Cooperative League. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt ""dropped in"" at the office of The Cooperative League December 18 to discuss the growth of the cooperative movement with leaders of the American movement.<query> who was the father of the cooperative movement</query> The Cooperative Builder changed from a semi-monthly to a weekly co-op news paper in March. The Farmers Union, at its national convention in Omaha, ""went cooperative"" by making the development of cooperatives the major emphasis of its national program. Rural Electrification made its greatest progress to date. Dur ing the year the Rural Electrification Ad ministration loaned $33,000,000 to coop eratives for the erection of lines and plants for the distribution of power. Important Support from Other Fields Endorsements of the consumers coop erative movement were voted by the conventions of the American Federation of Labor, the United Rubber Workers of America and the Steel Workers Organ izing Committee in addition to a number 22 of state and local labor organizations Governor Herbert Lehman of the Sta of New York endorsed consumer coo eratives in his annual message to tk"" New York State Legislature and ad cated the organization of milk cooper°"" tives as yardsticks to determine thp f •"" <• r «n lair price of milk.<query> what was the main goal of the cooperative movement</query> The Federal Trade Commission, jn tu report of its study on Agricultural In come, declared that ""the heavy costs of distribution cannot expect to be kept in satisfactory check without consumer co operatives."" But before the reoort was published that section was withdrawn Most significant events of the year as far as support from religious organiza tions were concerned were: The formation of a special committee on the Church and Cooperatives as a section of the Industrial Division of the Federal Council of Churches; Important emphasis on the cooperative movement at the Catholic Rural Life Conference at Richmond; And the National Assembly of the Stu dent Christian Movement and the Na tional Conference of Methodist Youth which took uncompromising positions in support of the consumers cooperative movement. Educational Progress In the field of cooperative education several extremely important steps were taken. The State of Minnesota approved the expenditure of $5,000 for the prepara tion of study materials on consumers co operation and cooperative marketing to be used in the public schools.<query> what was the importance of the consumer cooperative movement</query> The North Dakota State Legislature also approved a bill providing for instruction in con sumer cooperation and cooperative mar keting in the public schools. A survey of the teaching of consumers cooperation in colleges, conducted by The Cooperative League, showed 18 colleges with specific courses on the co operative movement and an additional 131 colleges and universities where the cooperative movement is discussed in courses in marketing, economics and sociology. , In the number of institutes conducted, the Northern States Cooperative League led all other cooperative organizations. ' ft, Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperative As iatic*1 pioneered in cooperative camp S? rk with 20 camps from three to ten j^ vs duration for youth, employees and coooerative executives. A National Cooperative Recreation Institute in Des Moines in June drew 50 tudents, many of them education and »creation directors of cooperatives. Im mediately following the institute educa tional directors and editors from coop eratives throughout the country met for a three-day conference.<query> what was the cooperative movement</query> Tours of Nova Scotia and Europe took more than a hundred cooperators to make intensive studies of the cooperative movement in those sections. For honors in reaching the general public with the cooperative idea, a medal of the year could well be awarded to the March of Time's newsreel on ""Finland's 20th Birthday"" which displayed pictures of Finnish co-ops in 11,000 theatres throughout the country. New Worlds to Conquer New organizations which date their of ficial existence from 1937, many of them pioneering in new fields, include the fol lowing organizations: The Cooperative College, New York, sponsored by The Cooperative League as a training school for prospective coop erative educators and executives; The Bureau of Cooperative Medicine, to educate for and advise in the forma tion of cooperative health associations; The Cooperative Book Club, also in New York, which will act as cooperative purchasing agent buying books of all types for members in all sections of the country; And Greenbelt Cooperative Services, set up by Consumer Distribution Cor poration to assist in putting all the com mercial enterprises in the government's model town at Greenbelt, Maryland, on a cooperative basis.<query> when did cooperative organizations start</query> Big Broadcasts of 1937 Several cooperative wholesales and a number of local cooperatives launched Jugular radio programs during the year, twelve national broadcasts over coast- to-coast hookups of the National Broad casting Company, the Columbia Broad casting System and the new Mutual Consumers' Cooperation February, 1938 Broadcasting System were arranged dur ing the year.

European Interpretation The Cooperative Wholesale, VOLG of Winterthur, Switzerland, as nearly as any other, was similar in its earlier be ginnings to most of the cooperative wholesales in the United States. The Re port of the Inquiry on Cooperative Enter prise in Europe says in describing VOLG, ""Consumer Cooperation among the rural population began near Winter thur with the organization of a society that engaged at first only in the joint pur chase of artificial fertilizer, but later added other farm supplies and consumers' goods."" It should be particularly noted that the report says that ""Consumer Co operation among farmers started with the joint purchase of fertilizer,"" which is one of the principal items in farm supplies.<query> what is the definition of cooperative</query> The Swedish Cooperative Wholesale KF has published a pamphlet entitled ""Farmers' and Consumers' Cooperation."" In this pamphlet they have a diagram showing the consumer and producer eco nomic interest of farmer, labor and pro fessional groups. The chart showing the consumer economic interests of farmers describes them as of two types, namely: the cooperative purchasing of household goods and the cooperative purchasing of vocational goods. As used by KF, the word ""vocational"" includes all forms of farm supplies. The subheads in the pamphlet further clarify their definition of the Consumers' Cooperative Move ment. The subheads read, ""The Farmer as a Household Consumer"" and ""The Farmer as a Vocational Consumer."" Un der the first heading of ""The Farmer as a Household Consumer"" they discus ti i- 1 • 1 e ^^Uot) tflP cooperative purchasing by farmers of n forms of household supplies.<query> what is the definition of cooperative purchasing</query> \\ '.....

A new book describing the cooperative movement in Norway includes the co operative purchasing of all forms of goods as parts of Consumers Cooperation It says, ""Taking all the members of the dif ferent consumers cooperative organiza tions into consideration: the Cooperative Union and Wholesale Society, the inde pendent cooperative societies and the co operative purchasing pools, it is a safe estimate that between 30 and 35 per cent or one-third of the population of Norway are members of cooperative consumers' societies of one kind or another. On a trip through France, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, England and Scotland we discussed this subject of the correct definition of Consumers' Coop eration with the leaders in each country.<query> what is the definition of cooperative</query> Universally the leaders with whom we talked declared personally that they con sidered the cooperative purchasing of farm supplies to be part of the Con sumers' Cooperative Movement. Vaino Tanner, President of the Inter national Cooperative Alliance, General Manager of the Elanto Society of Hel- singfors and Minister of Finance of Fin land, said, ""We have two great Con sumers' Cooperative groups in Finland.' The newer Cooperative Wholesale group, with which he is directly con nected, namely OTK, handles both household and domestic goods in the one organization. In the case of the other Co operative Wholesale group, as a result of mistaken theorizing in the early be ginning, so we were told, the wholesaling of farm supplies was organized sePa^fJ ly from the wholesaling of household supplies, although both are considered as part of Consumers' Cooperation, ana the products of both wholesales are dis tributed through the same retail coopera tives.<query> who is the president of the cooperative movement</query> , A separate cooperative wholesale Consumers' Cooperation farm supplies was at one time [ in England but failed and re- 1 cooperatives which handle farm sup- 'T s are members of the Cooperative Wholesale Society, which is the largest C nsumers' Cooperative Wholesale in , world. George Walworth, Agricul- I ^dviser of The Cooperative Union, tu s ""By establishing combinations of S reducers for the purpose of buying bulk 11 ts of feeding stuffs, fertilizers, etc. on cooperative basis it is possible to take membership with the C.W.S. and to secure the advantages of bulk purchases (roffl the Consumers Movement. About 100 of the agricultural requisite societies are members of the C.W.S. These re quisite societies are quite definitely con sumers' societies, for the purchases made are goods for consumption in the main even though the members may be agri cultural producers."" American Interpretation In the United States there is a rapidly growing realization that the cooperative purchasing by ultimate users of all forms of goods, whether farm or home supplies, is all part of one great Consumers' Co operative Movement.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative wholesale</query> The Central Co operative Wholesale group of Superior, Wisconsin, was the first to fully realize this fact. Midland Cooperative Whole sale of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the first cooperative wholesale in the field of petroleum products, with its membership entirely of farmers in the beginning, has adopted as its slogan ""An Organization Devoted to Building the Consumers' Co operative Movement."" An officer of the cooperative whole sale at St. Paul, Minnesota, says, ""A consumer cooperative is formed1 for the purpose of pooling the purchasing power of its members. The Farmers Union Cen tral Exchange is this type of a coopera tive."" This wholesale largely handles 'arm supplies. The Union Oil Company of North Kansas City, Missouri, which started as a farm supply cooperative wholesale, and whose trade is still prin cipally in farm supplies although it has ""ow added a grocery department, changed its name to Consumers Cooper- atlve Association to conform to its Realer understanding of the fact that it s a part of the world-wide Consumers iry, 1938 Cooperative Movement.<query> what was the first cooperative wholesale</query> An address de livered by the leader of the Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperatives is entitled, ""We Are Powerful as Consumers"" and clearly sets forth the fact that the cooperative purchasing of farm supplies and of auto mobile and fire and life insurance are, equally with household supplies, all divi sions of Consumers' Cooperation. The understanding of our economic functions as consumers is so largely a new idea that it is not to be wondered that it takes time for everyone to come to a full realization of the fact that the co operative purchasing of all forms of food, goods or services by ultimate users are all integral parts of the Consumers' Cooper ative Movement. We are so accustomed to thinking of ourselves as producer? that we find it difficult to break through our habits of thought and realize the full meaning of organizing as consumers.<query> what is the role of cooperatives in the consumer cooperative movement</query> But an understanding is growing in America among cooperative wholesale leaders and members that the Swedes have thought through the economic classifications of society correctly when they describe us all as having two economic interests and name them ""Consumer or Buyer In terests"" and ""Producer or Seller In terests."" A Great Consumers' Cooperative Movement Needed in America The more rapidly this clear definition is understood, the more rapidly will we build in America the great and all-in clusive Consumers' Cooperative Move ment which this nation should and must have to match the large producers' or ganizations of Farm Cooperatives and Labor Unions and together, as organized consumers and producers, be able to solve our economic problems of unemployment, poverty and tenancy as has already largely been done in Sweden and Fin land. Vaino Tanner, President of the Inter national Cooperative Alliance, con cluded his comments on the American Cooperative Movement by expressing in question form his great hope for America, ""Are American cooperative purchasing groups understanding more and more that they are Consumers?"" We were happy to be able to answer that they are.<query> what is the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> 25 AMERICAN YOUTH GOES COOPERATIVE H'RISTMAS week was cooperative week for several thousand American college young people this year. The students attending the National Methodist Student Conference in St. Louis, December 28-31 took a definitely critical attitude toward the profit system and recommended general social educa tion, establishment of cooperatives and support of the labor movement. ""We recognize Rochdale cooperatives as being one of the most Christian ways yet evolved for building a more Christian eco nomic order. We recommend that coopera tives on Rochdale principles be set up on campuses by the students wherever they be advantageous, in order that we may become acquainted with their advantages and carry them on in later life,"" The First National Conference of Uni versity Students in Canada was held on the campus of the University of Mani toba in Winnipeg, Christmas week. More than 350 students, representing every large university in Canada, passed unani mously resolutions pressing for instruc tion in the cooperative movement as a regular part of the college curricula and urging the formation of student coopera tives.<query> what is cooperative week</query> The National Student Federation of America holding its annual convention of student body presidents and secretaries and editors of college publications at Albuquerque, N. M., approved the or ganization of campus co-ops as an ef fective way of cutting the costs of educa tion and discussed the relation of co-ops to the official student body organizations. At Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N. Y., 600 delegates to the American Stu dent Union devoted their major consider ation to the role of the college student in the present international crisis. But the assembly renewed its approval of campus co-ops and 50 students meeting in a spe cial section on cooperatives discussed the technique of organizing student coopera tives and representatives from co-ops on several eastern campuses reported the progress they had made during the past year. The economics commission of the Na tional Assembly of the Student Christian 26 Movement, meeting at Miami Oxford, Ohio.<query> what is the purpose of co-ops</query> December 27 to 1, went definitely on record declaring^ present system is unchristian because ï fails to distribute equitably the goods are able to produce. The commission rec ommended basic but gradual change to "" system based on the service motive and advocated as the methods to attain that goal the organization of cooperatives a strong labor movement and public owner ship of natural monopolies in the interest of all the people. Twenty managers and members of co operative dormitories, eating clubs and book stores held a special meeting in con nection with the National Assembly at Oxford and proposed the organization of a League of College Cooperatives which would continue the work of the National Committee on Student Cooperatives which has been assisting the organization of campus co-ops during the last two vears. William Moore, Hanover College. Hanover, Indiana, was appointed head of a committee to draw up tentative consti tution and by-laws for the proposed league.<query> what was the purpose of the league of college cooperatives</query> A week before the Christmas holidays, managers of student co-ops at the Uni versities of California, Oregon, Wash ington, Idaho and British Columbia met at Seattle for a Pacific Coast Student Co operative Conference. Approximately 1650 student members were represented by the 50 delegates. The three-day con ference was devoted to discussions of methods of organization, technical prob lems of administration and bookkeeping and educational programs. A second conference will be held at Washington State College during the Easter Vaca tion. There are student co-ops on more than 160 campuses in the United States today according to a report presented by Wil liam Moore at a special session on cam pus co-ops at the National Assembly at Oxford.

It is easy for Lateur groups to stage as no sets or costumes are required.) Permission to broadcast ""Fill 'er Up"" is granted, royalty free, provided the following announcement is made over the air: ""This is a Scholastic Radio Play, presented through the courtesy^ of Scholastic, the American High School Weekly."" The incidents in this play are based upon the true history of several oil cooperatives of the Middle West. Names, places and characters, how ever, are wholly fictitious. EFFECT: Fade in on the sharp roar LJ of a motor car. Brakes screech and wheels churn in gravel as car comes to a 'stop. Two blasts of auto horn, staccato and rhythmic.<query> what is fill er up</query> These set the pace for the dialog which is carried on in a singsong manner with special voices to each side. The effect is of many motorists and many attendants. Horn: Beep, Beep! Attendants: Yes, sir! Motorists: Fill 'er up! Attendants: Yes, sir! Check your oil? Motorists: No, sir! Attendants (Business-like): Yes, sir. Effect: The motor roars again and fades out quickly. Pause. Fade in the slow tread of a pair of heavy feet on concrete, contrasting with the brisk pace of the first scene. Dolly (High-pitched, reedy voice): How dy, Herb. Takin' a stroll? (Footsteps stop abruptly). Herb: Walkin' to the store. Wanna come along, Dolly? D°lly: It's a hot day for walkin'.<query> what is the effect of the motor roaring</query> Did your car break down? Herb: No ... the car ain't broke, but I ajn. These oil prices . . . u°Hy: High as skyrockets! But they tell me the high price of oil is goin' to put us all on our feet. Consumers' Cooperation February? Ellen Edwards Editor Marc Rosenblum Pauline Gibson Herb: You mean they're puttin' the oil company on its feet. They're putting me on my back. Price went up another cent today. Dolly: Maybe we ought'a boycott them. Quit buyin' oil. Herb: We gotta have oil. Can't run your farm without it. Dolly: Seems like somebody in town would sell it cheaper. Herb: Nope—same price all over iwn. Except that cooperative society the boys are talkin' about. Dolly: What kind of a society did you say?<query> why is oil price going up</query> Herb: Cooperative . . . some of the boys got a crazy notion about havin' the people in town who buv oil own their own station. Run it for themselves 'stead of for profit. Sounds cr-acked to me! Dollv: Sounds like the heat's got 'em. (They both laugh). Well, s'long, Herb. (Fading out) I'm goin' the other way. Herb: (Fading): S'long. (pause) Effect! Fade in on telephone ringing persistently. Burton (Calm, forceful voice): Burton speaking. Jed (A tinny, excitable voice heard through the phone receiver): This is Jed. Burton: Good! What did the bank say? Jed: Bank says we don't need another filling station in this town. Burton: But will they lend us money for a tank and pump?<query> herbal s'long meaning</query> Jed: They'll lend us money personally ... but they won't lend anything to the co operative. Burton: (Impatiently): They won't lend money to the cooperative society, but they'll lend it to us personally? What's 27 II. I the matter? Don't they trust the coop erative? Jed: No ... they say it won't last! They say we're going to lose out! Burton: Bosh! (Pause). All right, if they'll trust us personally, I'll take out a loan and put the money in the cooperative. Will you? Jed: Sure! Burton: Think the rest of the fellows will risk it? Jed: I think they will. Burton: Round them up for a meeting to night, then, Jed. Looks like we can open up next week ... soon as we get the tank and pump in.<query> who lends money to the cooperative society</query> Jed: Okay, Burton. Burton: By the way, I signed up a new member today. And there are going to be a lot of others come in (Fading out) as soon as they see we mean business. (Pause).

Burton: I have good reason to think it will. The Tartan Oil- Company is ask ing us to come back and deal with- them ... I guess we aren't too small for them now. Jed (Laughing): I hope you told them to go jump at the moon. 29 Burton: I might have told him that, at the rate the cooperatives are growing, in stead of buying his oil, we might buy his whole plant, Jed: Say, I hear they are seriously in terested in selling their plant because they are losing so much money lately.<query> who is the tartan oil company</query> (Fading out).

(Pause) This property has been ordered for sale because the Tartan Oil Blending Company was not paying its debts.

Consumers' Cooperation COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH New York—The Cooperative College If rnierly The Cooperative League Insti- °K\ will open its second term February Vi -pjje Co -op College met with an en- h siastic response last fall. Twenty-two 'dents from 13 states completed the 5 demie sessions in December and are Rationed in cooperatives in various sec tions of the country doing practical field ' k. Many of them have already found permanent places in the movement. The Spring term will last for five months. The first three will be spent in jvjew York, the two following are to be devoted to field work in cooperatives. Oklahoma City, Okla.—The tendency of farm groups to turn from political reg ulation to the organization of producers and consumers cooperatives as the per manent means of achieving economic equality is indicated by the special full- day program on cooperatives which was held immediately following this year's regular program of the National Farmers Union Convention.<query> when does the cooperative college open</query> The special cooperative day ""marks a new start in the development of coopera tion,"" according to Editor A. W. Ricker of the Farmers' Union Herald. ""Hence forth,"" said Mr. Ricker, ""the emphasis will be more on cooperation and less de pendency on political regulation."" Editor L. S. Herron of the Nebraska Union Farmer, declared that ""Cooperation holds the answer"" to such contrasts as profits and poverty, so-called surpluses and un employment. Chairman of the cooperative day was C.'L. McCarthy, manager of the Farmers Union State Exchange, Omaha, Nebras ka. Said fellow co-op manager J. L. Nolan of the Farmers Union Central Ex change, St. Paul, ""There are tremendous possibilities in consumer cooperation."" Pittsburgh—The Steel Workers Or ganizing Committee, meeting here for its annual convention December 14, 15 and '6, unanimously endorsed the Consumers ^operative Movement and urged its members to join consumer cooperatives to protect the workers and their families, as c°nsumers of goods, in terms of lower , 1938 prices and higher quality of goods."" ""WHEREAS, one of the fundamental reasons for organization of labor is to protect the workers from the abuse of employers and to insure a. better standard of living for the workers and their families; and WHEREAS, the labor organizations, fighting to make wages keep pace with the higher costs of living, discover that each wage in crease is met with still higher living costs; and WHEREAS, the workers organized as Con sumers function to keep prices down and the quality of goods high; and WHEREAS, The Cooperative Distributors, Inc., is ready to serve trade unions and their families as a nation-wide purchasing and mail order association and The Cooperative League of the U.S.A. with its affiliates is working for consumer cooperation between Labor, Farmer and Middle Class groups; RESOLVED, that this Convention endorses and supports the Consumers' Cooperative Movement, urging our members to join these Consumers' Cooperative Organizations for the purpose of protecting the workers and their families, as consumers of goods, in terms of lower prices and higher quality of goods."" New York-—With its initial funds pro vided by chain store interests, the Con sumers Foundation, Inc. completed its or ganization here Saturday, January 8, with the election of William Trufant Foster, director of the Pollack Foundation, as president.<query> why was cooperative day created</query> In a press conference preceding the or ganization meeting of the board, Dr. Foster frankly admitted that the $25,000 grant which led to the organization of the Consumers Foundation, Inc. was made by the Institute of Distribution which is supported by chain stores, variety stores and mail order houses. Members of the Board of Directors and the National Council include heads of women's clubs, ministers and college professors as well as several nationally- known business men including Henry !.. Harriman, former president of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, George F. Benk- hart, Vice-Président of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, D. M.

Albany, N. Y.—Herbert H. Lehman, Governor of the State of New York, in his annual message to the state legisla ture, January 5, declared that consumer cooperatives should be definitely encour aged and urged their organization as ""yardsticks for the measurement of fair and just distribution costs."" Pointing to the failure of both state and industry control in attempting to provide fair prices for the consumer. Governor Lehman declared: ""There can be no satisfactory solution of the milk problem, either under state or in dustry control, if the milk of the producer is not made available to the consumer at a price he can afford to pay.<query> who is governor of new york</query> ""The state should continue to lend its in fluence and aid to efforts to discover the cor rect solution of this problem. Establishment of consumer cooperatives for direct distribu tion of milk from producer to consumer should be definitely encouraged. These undertakings could be made yardsticks for the measure ment of fair and just distribution costs. Their results supplementing previous inquiries and the present audit of the company books, should provide the practical information on price spread that has heretofore not been available. Properly operated consumer cooperatives can supply milk at better retail prices and yet not impair a fair return to the producer."" New York—To fill the demand for a publication of a magazine stressing coop erative health association, the Bureau of Cooperative Medicine, 5 East 57 Street, New York, is planning to launch a 32- page monthly publication. The magazine, ""Cooperative Health,"" will be digest size and will appeal not only to members of cooperative health associations but to farm, labor and cooperative groups as well as socially-minded doctors.<query> what is cooperative milk</query> Publication of ""Cooperative Health"" is planned for early spring.

Cooperators must teach labor leaders and members that the ""some power some where"" is in their own pocketbooks. By organizing into consumers cooperatives and directing their purchasing into coop erative stores, wholesales and factories which they themselves own, workers can become their own employers. This is the only way they will ever insure steady jobs and incomes.<query> who said that every citizen of the united states has a right to work?</query> The cooperative own ership of industry is the only guarantee °f the right to work and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Political Unity of Farmers and Workers in Sweden Farmers and industrial workers in Sweden have finally found a common denominator in politics. A bulletin of the World Association for Adult Education describes the uniting of these two great groups as follows: ""The interests of the farming population and of the industrial workers of Sweden had been found to coincide. A Social-Democratic Government was formed in September, 1932, which had the support of the Farmers' Party. The final consummation of this development was achieved in September of last year (1936) when representatives of the Farmers' Party entered a Government under Social- Democratic leadership, a coalition of which no one today is able to foresee the end."" America will really move forward, in stead of limping along as we are now doing, when farm and labor and office workers learn that they have common in terests and join together as consumers and citizens to promote them.<query> when did the farmers party form a government</query> Sweden points the way! There each vocational group has its own separate organization, but all the groups have found a common denominator as consumers and citizens.

Big busi ness isn't organized for that purpose. Big business is organized to pay the least pos sible and charge the most possible in or der to make the largest possible profits. Big business cannot go into the highest possible production because of the un certainty of the demand. So big business must always operate on the basis of lower volume, higher prices and lower wages than is possible. Big business itself can not change the rules of the game. And the government cannot change the rules either. Only the people can do that, and gradually the people will, as they learn that consumer cooperative ownership is the only answer. * * * Calling Names vs. Solving Problems It isn't a question of who but what is at the foundation of our economic trou bles.<query> why is it important that big business operate on the basis of lower prices and lower wages than is Theodore Roosevelt popularized the phrase ""malefactors of great wealth."" What good did it do in his day to lay the fault to individuals? Now Franklin Roosevelt has popular ized the expression ""economic royalists."" What good will it do today to charge individuals with our troubles? The Brookings Institution studies show that 2% of the people save $10,000,000,- 000 more than they can consume, but it isn't the fault of the 2%, it's the fault of the 98% who permit them to do so. There is no good accomplished in slurring the 2% by any names. It would be better, if names are to be called, that we 98% call ourselves ""economic innocents and il literates."" It isn't who is at fault but what is at fault. What we must learn is that the fault is in the system that we have adopted which causes the many to be poor and the few to be rich.<query> who popularized the phrase economic royalists</query> We must learn that it's the system of monopolism which we have that lowers pay to pro- 34 ducers and raises prices to consumers results in profits to the few and pov to the many. Then we must learn that th answer is in developing cooperative e nomic organizations of ourselves as °"" ducers, consumers and citizens. We m °"" learn that Farm Cooperatives, Lab Unions, Credit Unions, Consumers C * operatives, Social Insurances and Publ°"" Utilities—the six great democratic no'C profit economic organizations ~ wiii eventually form a new cooperative eco nomic organization of society which will produce and distribute plenty to all I* does no good but harm for the 98% to call the 2% names—what we 98% must do is to organize a cooperative economic society. The Poor—Rich One of America's ""Poor—Rich"" girls the former Barbara Hutton, heiress to the Woolworth millions, returned to Amer ica on Tuesday, December 14 and de parted on the same ship on Wednesday.<query> what is the answer to the question of cooperative economic society</query> December 15. During the few hours she spent on the soil of her native country, she renounced her citizenship ""for a mess of pottage,"" the ""pottage"" being the pos sibility of saving a few dollars of income taxes on her estimated fortune of $45,- 000,000, of which $32,000,000 was in government securities. From now on the American people will go on paying and •paying and paying interest on her gov ernment securities. If American adults want to continue to do this, of course they have the demo cratic right to do so, but there are indi cations that the young girls employed at Woolworth stores, each of whom has contributed to the accumulation of this fortune in the lower wages they have re ceived, are going to not only say, but do something about another American girl being given the opportunity, at their ex pense, to live in the lap of luxury all her life long.<query> why did the young girl at woolworths renounce her citizenship</query> It was more than a coincidence that while one of our economic queens set her dainty foot on her native American soil for a few hours, the exploited Wool- worth clerks should have staged a strike for higher wages. Such incidents ought to bring home more graphically to every American the necessity of establishing economic equality. J938-AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY U\\ THAT'S ahead for Cooperatives W in 1938?"" Instead of answering with optimistic rophecies, let's look at the facts. They ''ill be all the clearer by comparing 1938 with 1921 and 1930, since these three «ears followed collapses in the economic system at the close of the previous years. jn Third Depression Since World War political and business leaders may call this period a ""recession"" instead of a ""de pression,"" but the decline in business ac tivity has been more rapid than ever be fore and, at this writing, the end is not in sight.<query> what was the economic opportunity ahead for cooperatives w in 1938</query> According to the New York Times index, business activity has now fallen [aster than it did in 1920 and as far in three months as it fell in twenty-three months after 1929, or in almost eight times as long a period- The People Now Aroused Generally Depressions are always favorable pe riods for cooperative growth and today should be the best opportunity of all since the people are far more generally aroused than they were after 1920 and 1929. Then they had been lulled into lethargy by the speculative booms of the previous years, but the present depression follows years of unemployment for millions and in security for the masses. The minds of the people are today far more receptive to self-help cooperative action. They are disillusioned about our get-rich-quick economic system, as well as about the ability of the government to regulate the profit system successfully to provide em ployment and incomes for all.<query> why are people aroused</query> Cooperatives Proven Successful The 1920 depression started farmers organizing cooperatives in dead earnest; the 1929 depression started office work ers in cities organizing themselves into consumers cooperatives; the 1937 depres sion will, we believe, start labor groups generally organizing themselves as con- sumers^ into cooperatives. The Con sumers' Cooperative Movement is now under way in all three great groups— ariners, office and factory workers. *n 1920 there were no cooperative oil Consumers' Cooperation March, 1938 stations among farmers and few coop erative stores handling either farm or home supplies. Since 1920 thousands of cooperative oil stations and stores have been organized by farm groups who have proven their ability to operate them suc cessfully. In 1930 there were no cooperative gas oline stations or grocery stores in cities except the few organized by foreign lan guage groups- Since 1930 there have been a large number of cooperative grocery stores and oil stations organized by city residents and others are developing ra pidly.<query> when did cooperatives start</query> Now, in 1938, we have among farm, and city residents thousands of success ful examples of retail cooperative oil sta tions and stores after which to pattern; and a score of wholesale cooperatives from which new retail cooperatives can, purchase. These two basic differences between 1938 and the periods following the previous depressions beginning in 1921 and 1930, are all important—first, the fact that the minds of the people are far more inclined towards cooperative action, and, second, the fact that thousands of successful cooperatives have been organ ized after which new co-ops may pattern» National Leaders Advocating Cooperatives The third fact of great significance in 1938 is that national leaders in every field are actively directing the minds of the people towards Consumers' Coopera tives as a democratic solution of our eco nomic problems. National religious leaders are now ac tively promoting cooperatives.<query> what was the difference between the depression of 1938 and the depression of 1930</query> The In dustrial Department of the Federal Coun cil of Churches has recently set up a spe cial ""Church and Cooperatives Commit tee"" which is actively organizing sight seeing seminars on cooperatives. The National Catholic Welfare Council is in cluding the subject of coopératives in both its rural and industrial conference programs. National educational leaders have been aroused by the action of the States of Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota 35 in legislating to include the subject of Cooperatives in public school curricula in those States. Curriculum leaders, such as the Society for Curriculum Study, the Curriculum Laboratory of Teachers Col lege at Columbia University and the Na tional Education Association, are now active in responding to the demand for material for teachers and pupils on the subject of Consumers' Cooperatives. National political leaders are showing an increasing interest in the Consumers' Cooperative Movement.<query> what states are coopératives in public schools</query> Not only did President Roosevelt send a special com mission to Europe to study the subject, but Mrs. Roosevelt personally visited the office of The Cooperative League to learn more about the movement. This year also opened with Governor Lehman of New York specifically advocating the organizing of Consumers' Cooperatives in the milk field; with Governor Murphy of Michigan creating a State office of Con sumers' Counsel: with Governor LaFol- lette of Wisconsin proclaiming February H to 18th as Wisconsin Cooperative ""Week and with Governor Aiken of Ver mont, urging everyone to study the Co operative Movement. National youth organizations started the year of 1938 off by devoting part of their holidays to studying Cooperatives. Four national youth organizations met during the Christmas vacation on whose programs Cooperatives were featured. A section of the National Committee on Student Cooperatives called a two-day Conference at the University of Wash ington in Seattle which brought together representatives of college cooperatives from four Western States.<query> when did the cooperative movement start</query> Reed, Mabel ................................................................... 37 Regli, Werner E. ............................................................... 199 Resolutions Committee, Report of ............................................... 206 Reviews, Pamphlets and Books ...................... 15, 48, 63, 95, 109, 127, 143, 159 Ringham, F.

The contrast is showing up all the more strongly today between the results of the competitive and the cooperative economic systems- The competitive system is prov ing its inability to stabilize production, employment or investment; on the other hand, the cooperative movement is prov ing that it is able to do so. Cooperative volumes are being maintained, coopera tive employees have not been laid off, and cooperatives have not lost money for their investors.<query> what was the result of the consumer cooperative movement</query> Cooperatives proved suc cessful after the 1929 crash and should prove all the more successful now after the 1937 crash. ""Will the Consumers' Cooperative Movement Rise to the Opportunity? A great test confronts the leaders and members of the Consumers' Cooperative Movement today. The greater oppor tunity toward which the Consumers' Co operative Movement has been building has arrived in 1938. Will the Cooperative Movement rise to the occasion? A great publicity, educational and organizational campaign is needed nationally, regionally- and locally. More of the savings made by the Cooperative Movement should be voted for education and expansion, rather than for immediate dividends, to make such campaigns possible everywhere. Consumers' Cooperation h an expenditure now of a larger part f the savings will return far larger divi- 3 nds in the future. In a 9reat new :b°°k» ""The Choice Be lls,"" the world famous writer, E. Stanley Jones, challenges us: ""Change the basis of society from competi tion to cooperation and the more you produce the more widely you distribute, for now you have both the motive and the technique for distribution, namely, cooperation.<query> when did the cooperative movement start</query> And under this the whole level of life goes up for every body. The machine is. now no longer har nessed to the private-profit of the few, but to the good of the many, and the more you speed it up, the more widely you distribute to the raising of the general level. You are no longer afraid of the machine. It is not now the agent of unemployment and confusion, but the agent of the people. Under a cooperative order there need be no unemployment. Unemployment is not inherent in a cooperative order as it is in a competitive one. If there is danger of over production (which would be small, for our real problem is not over-production, but under consumption), the number of working hours for everybody would simply be reduced. If we could supply the world's needs in less time, so much the better.<query> what is the difference between a cooperative order and a cooperative order?</query> We would have more time for cultural living."" It's either a case of developing eco nomic democracy faster by building co operatives everywhere or succumbing to greater and greater economic dictator ship, which will finally involve religious, educational and political dictatorship as well. Cooperators everywhere should rise to this great occasion. It may well be a historical turning point which this third depression since the war has placed be fore us. We have built the groundwork, now let every individual cooperator and every cooperative association act upon this opportunity! NEWFOUNDLAND GOES COOPERATIVE ""We'll rant and we'll roar like true Newfound landers We'll rant and we'll roar on deck and below, Until we see bottom inside the two sunkers Then straight through the channel to Tuslo we'll go-"" WE are in the parish hall of the church at Port au Port on the west coast of Newfoundland.<query> where is newfoundland</query> Every one roars out the chorus as good Newfoundlanders should for this is the first Cooperative Conference on the west coast. Ninety- five delegates have registered. They are farmers and fishermen. Mclsaacs, Mc- Kays and McNeils from the Codroy and Benoits, Gallants and O'Quins (which is French not Irish) from Lourdes and Cape St, George- The Gathering of the Clans Sunday had been train day. At every little station knots of cooperators boarded the train. A large delegation came from the Codroy Valley where there is con siderable cooperative activity. As the tain filled up there was a mounting ex citement as cooperators from Codroy and Tompkins met cooperators from Heather- ton and the Highlands. Monday morning saw a swelling crowd around the'hall as March, 1938 Mabel Reed Mary Ellicott Arnold the neighboring villages began to arrive, Stephenville only eight miles away and Lourdes, two hours ride across the Bay.<query> where is the gathering of the clans</query> As it nears 2:30 the delegates take their places in the front rows. The morn ing had been cloudy but by noon the sun shone on the conference and the back rows filled quickly. We meet Father Ker- win from Port au Port and Father O'Reilly from Lourdes and the Rev. Mr- Jackson, Supt. of Missions for the United Church of Newfoundland. Then there is the Rev. M>r. Butler, Church of England, from Stony Point and the Rev. Mr. Holmes, United Church, from St. Georges- Like Nova Scotia, the Cooper ative Movement in Newfoundland looks to the Church for leadership and finds it alike in Protestant and Catholic. The speeches in the opening session reflect the feeling of the meeting. ""The Cooperative Movement is new in New foundland,"" said Mr. Downy, the Chair man. ""We are attempting something unique in the history of this country.<query> who is the pastor of the cooperative movement in newfoundland</query> We have got to lay aside our selfish ideas and work for the common good."" ""We must get the people interested in the coopera tive way,"" said another speaker. ""They learn about it through their study clubs. 37 It is hard work and must be kept at- But the cooperative way is the only way of solving our problems."" ""In the Coopera tive Movement,"" said a man from the Codroy Valley, ""the study club is the first step. The study club is a university that every man and woman can attend."" Credit Unions and Study Clubs The local leaders were next on the pro gram. They were only two months old at Cape St. George but they had eleven study clubs. They averaged about eight to a club. They were collecting for a credit union. They had 47 members and they had collected $25-00.<query> what is the cooperative way</query> In Port au Port they had been working for over a year. They had five study clubs and a credit union. The credit union had a capital of $367. In Stephenville they had ten study clubs and had collected $250 for their credit union. In McKays every one was in the study club and they had an Agricultural society. ""You have got to get the right idea in the first place,"" said their leader, ""or you will have trou ble in the end."" In the Codroy they had 23 study clubs with 250 members and last week they had started their credit union with $700- The second day was given over to agriculture, education and the need for good roads. M.r. Banks, Director of Agri culture, was there and a session was de voted to pigs and poultry, the need for pure bred stock and above all the neces sity for grading.<query> how many study clubs in mckays nc</query> The speeches were good and to tlhe point. Rigs and Roads It is late afternoon, as we watch the sunset over the Bay of St. George, when we come to the pressing need of the west coast for good roads. ^'You know the road from Cape St. Georoe,"" said Mr. Benoit, ""it is pretty bad. Father Green and I started Sunday, We had a gig. But an accident was looking .for a place to happen. The wheels came off. We thought we coundn't get to the Confer ence. But we borrowed a truck from a neighbor. Then there was another acci dent. The seat came off. Father Green sat on the floor in the back and I stood up and drove.

The station at Stephenville Crossing is crowded for the delegates from the Codroy Valley and the visitors from Nova Scotia are taking the train home. Everyone has come to see them off.<query> do you have cooperation in the united states</query> It is a very different crowd from that on Sun day. It is one big family on its way home from a fine time and ""we rant and we roar"" at the top of our lungs, dashing to the platform to wave goodbye to the dele gates as the different'home stations come along. As the numbers fall, the intimacy mounts. Promises are exchanged to stop and see me if you are in my town. It is dus'k before the last delegate drops off the lighted train into the dark- The Confer ence is over until next year. THE COOPERATIVE COLLEGE J. P. Warbasse COOPERATION as an economic method is leading the world into eW ways of business which may prove to be of salutary social importance. It -nay do the same in the field of educa- jjofl. Cooperative methods and ideals are equally applicable here. We may devise ways of education quite as dif ferent from the prevalent methods as our cooperative economics are different from prevalent business.<query> cooperative economics definition</query> The Cooperative Institute of The Co operative League, which was started in New York in the fall of 1937, was ex perimental; but, as an experiment, it proved three important points. It proved that it is possible Iby certain tests of aptitude and ability to select students who are particularly qualified for service in the cooperative movement. It proved that such selected students can be given training that especially fits them for co operative service. And it also showed that the cooperative movement of this country not only needs people of this character and with this training, but that it can give them jobs and supply them with a livelihood. Because of the existence of many in stitutes in the cooperative field and on account of the collegiate nature of this particular institution, the name has been changed to the Cooperative College. Col lege is from the latin word collegium, meaning a collection or assembly of people.<query> what was the cooperative institute of the cooperative league</query> The word has been used to mean a staff, an order, or a cult of per sons trained and qualified for -some spe cial function. I was once a member of what was cal'ed the ""Collegium"" of a hospital, meaning the attending profes sional staff of that institution. College in the sense used here means a fraternity of educated persons organized for the purpose of promoting their continuous education. A Fellowship of Cooperators I envisage the Cooperative College of the future as an institution which shall admit to its fellowship persons who by test and examination have been found Specially qualified for cooperative ser- Consumers' Cooperation March, 1938 vice, who have satisfactorily passed through its prescribed period of academic and laboratory training, and who are employed as executives, organizers, or teachers in cooperative societies. What ever the occupation of these people may be, they must still think of themselves as students; and as students they must con tinue for the rest of their lives.<query> what is the meaning of college</query> No stu dent who continues to comply with its requirements, should ever be graduated from the Cooperative College. The Col lege, the collegium, should not be thought of as the educational institution in New York. That is only the central educa tional and administrative bureau. The College should consist mainly of its stu dent body in the field of cooperative ser vice. The program may be expected to de velop as follows. Acceptable students should be admitted to the College- They should pass through its central training courses, serve as apprentices, and be given employment by cooperative so cieties. They should still be in the Col lege. Working with cooperative socie ties, they should be required to make a monthly report of their work to be sent to the central office of the College. The students should be held up to certain standards of conduct and culture.<query> what is the cooperative college</query> They should be advised of certain prescribed reading- This should include periodicals, pamphlets and books to guarantee that they ikeep abreast of the progress of their times. Students in Perpetuity At least once a year a report concern ing each cooperative collegian should be received from his employer. That means that the manager, president or secretary of the society, educational director, or other qualified official of the employing organization should send to the central office of the College a report answering certain questions about the work of the employee collegian. And once a year each student in the field should be required to send in a thesis based upon his work and observations. These theses, so far as possible, should be published in coopera- 39 Jr tive periodicals. Coming from educated and experienced workers in the 'field of cooperative action, they .should constitute a valuable part of the current literature of the movement.<query> how often should a cooperative collegian be sent a report</query> Criticism of coopera tive methods and practices might be found in these theses that should be highly use ful. There should be maintained between the students and the central office of the College a closeness which -should link the whole organization into an integrated body-—a cooperative fraternity. Students should be required to report periodically as to their activities, observations and ideas; and from these reports should be culled out material for a Cooperative College Bulletin to be sent regularly to each member of the College. Thus the members should1 be 'kept advised of the doings of their colleagues. All of this should be standardized, and students of the College should be made conscious that they are a part of a fra ternity in which loyalty and self-improve ment are prerequisites for membership. Students who have satisfactorily passed through the academic training of the College, who have effectively served their apprenticeship with a cooperative society, and who are employed by a so ciety may be permitted .to use the letters C. C. (Cooperative Collegian) in con nection with their names.<query> what is cooperative college</query> This means that they are members of the Coopera tive College. Unlike other colleges, the better the student the less the possibilities of his graduation. So long as the individual continues effectively to serve in coopera tive employment and to comply with the requirements of the College in his culture and self-improvement, he remains in col- legio, a member of the College. This membership is perpetual upon his main taining his position and qualifications. I believe that by this method we may build up in this country a body of coop erative executives and leaders who have approached their tasks from the -stand point of students and who have matured and risen through real cooperative scho larship. The College should be administered by its Board of Trustees, controlling its executives and staff. The Trustees should be chosen by the Cooperative College body. The College as an organization 40 should consist of its collegians, each V> ing one vote in its affairs.<query> what is cooperative college</query> Most of^"" business, on account of the size oc A? country, should be transacted by r*ef endum. The Trustees should be n, ^"" bers ex officio of the College. A mppt^"" of the College .should be held at the pi 9 and time of Congresses of The Cooper!6 tive League. As in any restricted order, collegians who fail to comply with the current r quirements of the College should V, graduated; i. e. dropped. That means they would no longer be Cooperative Collegians although they might continue to be efficient and worthy workers in the cooperative movement In order to coordinate this educational work in the United States, other coop erative training schools, whose standards of admission and education are of a satis factory grade, may become affiliated to the Cooperative College, and their stu dents may be accepted as Cooperative Collegians.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative college</query> » nFFlClAL NATIONAL JOU RNAL OF THE CONSUMERS' COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT Sweden, Political Unity of Farmers and Workers in ........................... ,"" \Jt > ' Swedish Voluntary Producers and Consumers Organizations .................... ^ Switzerland ....................................••.... •••••••••••••.......... 24 T Tanner, Vaino ................................................... 24, 25 PEACE-PLENTY-DEMOCRACY Teachers College, Columbia University ........................................ ^ ..«,„•••• rat Teaching of Cooperation in the Public Schools ..............................

C. C.) if they are willing to en ter and undertake compliance with its requirements. There should be no honor ary memberships nor fellowships in the College. Only those who have complied with the requirements, who perform co operative service, and who can submit themselves to the discipline of the Col lege should be admitted to or continued in membership. All of these details must be subject to the tests of experience- The College will change and evolve itself in the labora tory of cooperative experimentation. The important basis for its evolution is that the cooperative movement is growing, people trained specifically for the pur pose can serve the movement best, the possibilities of cooperative expansion are limited only by the limitation of ex ecutives and educators to carry on co operative affairs, and the efficiency of such executives and educators can best be maintained by their continuous at tachment to .an educational institution or which they are an integral part and which constantly contributes to -their culture.<query> what is the cooperative college</query> Consumers' Cooperation THE COOPERATIVE YARDSTICK E. R. Bowen T'HE great economic evils of today J. could be summed up in the three rds: Poverty, Unemployment, and Tenancy- Qr they could be stated as: T ss of Income, Loss of Jobs, Loss of Ownership. An income, a job and owner- hip of property are the three basic ele ments of economic justice. They spell economic security. They are implied in the ""inalienable rights"" of the Declara tion of Independence. An income, a job and ownership of property should be every man's inalienable economic rights. Disease Diagnosed No cure for a disease was ever ef fectively applied without a correct diag nosis. ""The best way to cure anything is to diagnose it correctly."" Correct solu tions to economic as well as physical di seases are based on two things: first, sound theorizing and second, proven analysis.<query> what are the three basic economic rights</query> Probably the simplest and best stated theoretical analysis of our great economic disease which has been evolved is by Dr. Henry Pratt Fairchild in ""The Fallacy of Profits."" The sum of his theory is stated in these words, ""In a fully capital ized society true profits must always he limited by the owners' capacity to con sume-"" Likewise the best statistical diagnosis of our economic disease is contained in a summary of the Brookings Institution re search studies entitled ""Income and Eco nomic Progress""—""The source of our eco nomic difficulties, then, is evident. There is no physical obstacle to the full utiliza tion of our oroductive capacity. The diffi culty is to be found rather in the unequal distribution of income and a resulting excess of savings as compared with con sumptive expenditures."" _ The Brookings Institution study America's Capacity to Consume"" re vealed that there were 15 billion dollars of individual savings in 1929.<query> who developed the economic disease</query> Further more that two-thirds, or 10 billions, of 'hese savings were concentrated in the nands of 2% of the population having in comes of over $10,000 a year. These sav- lngs were accumulated after the 2% had March, 1938 spent all they could in both ordinary and in ""riotous"" living. No wonder that they concluded, ""Our diagnosis of the eco nomic system has revealed that the way in which the income resulting from the nation's productive activities is divided among the various groups which com prise society, lies at the root of our diffi culties."" The further conclusion is reached that 5 billions of savings, or the amount saved by the 98%, were sufficient to take care of normal productive invest ment needs. Remedies Prescribed The problem of a remedy narrows down to the simple question: how shall we equitably redistribute the unnecessa ry 10 billions of excess savings which are now being concentrated in the hands of the 2% who neither need them, nor can consume them, nor can invest them profitably?<query> how much money did the 2% save</query> To do so is not injustice to the 2% — in fact it would be relieving them of an unnecessary burden which society now imposes upon them. On the other hand, a redistribution of the 10 billions to the 98% dispossessed would result in their receiving their inalianable economic rights since they are the producers of the 10 billions. It would mean the real ac ceptance by the United States of the principle of equality as applied to eco nomics. The only question is, how best to redistribute such excess savings and like wise to prevent their accumulating in the hands of the few in the future- The summary of the Brookings study prescribes three remedies: governmental taxation; increased pay to producers; lower prices to consumers. The difficulties facing the taxation remedy are easily. understood. To take away from the few what society has given them is difficult.<query> what is the remedy for redistribution</query> The assumption is that, since they have received that amount, they are entitled to it by the rules of the economic game. Most naturally the ques tion is also raised as to why an economic system should give huge incomes to the few and permit them to make such excess savings, which must afterwards be taken from them by the .political government? Why should not an economic system be 41 self-contained and within itself justly dis tribute the amount it produces without the necessity of government intervention? The second remedy of increasing pay to producers also has limitations. Every one knows that, no matter how effective ly either farmers or workers organize, the pay for the products or services they sell will be largely fixed by business and fi nance- Furthermore, even if by organiza tion an increase in pay is received, busi ness and finance will almost immediately extract the increase out of the pockets of farmers and workers in the higher prices they charge them as consumers of the finished products.<query> why should an economic system be self-contained and within itself justly dis tribute the amount It is also difficult to distribute the excess profits uniformly through the medium of increased pay to producers. Business and finance have found it possible to pit farmers and work ers against one another as producers and largely nullify the efforts of each pro ducer group to achieve justice in the pay it receives. After discussing these two proposed remedies, the summary of the Brookings Institution study concludes by strongly urging the adoption of the .third remedy of lowering prices to consumers: ""Taxa tion is a possible means of redistributing income, although tax-supported public works tend to stimulate the production of non-essentials as contrasted with such primary wants as food, clothing and shelter. The general raising of wages as a device for redistributing income also lias infinite possibilities. Its weakness lies in the fact that over half of the popula tion, including many of the poorest groups, are not wage-earners.<query> what is the remedy of lowering prices to consumers</query> Most promising of all is the proposal that in dustry revise its price policy and pass on to the ultimate consumer all of the bene fits wihich are obtained from technologi cal progress."" These remedies are prescribed after the root of our economic disease is deter mined.—""Our diagnosis is now complete. We have found the root of our difficulty in a concentration of income brought about by the price-fixing policies of mo nopolies and trusts.'' Applying the Remedies The Brookings statistical study led to a diagnosis of our economic disease in line with the best theorizing on the sub ject by Dr. Fairchild and others- It has 42 also determined the cause and the dies. Now it is a question of them. And here is where the study stops. How to apply the is not told. Business is only asked t ply them voluntarily. But business b ^"" self can not and will not do so- Busin '*"" is organized primarily to produce rao^ profits.<query> what is the root of economic disease</query> Yet excess profits have been d* agnosed as our economic disease. ' "" is required is an organization powerful than private-profit business to force the lowering of consumers' prices and the raising of producers' pay The organization to which the people of the United States have turned is the political government. And with what re sult? For fifty years we have fooled our selves by believing that it is possible to regulate industrial and finance monopolies through the political ^government. Donald Richberg calls them ""years of self-decep tion."" We passed anti-trust laws and then set out with a ""big stick"" to ""bust the trusts."" We have dissolved them, on ly to find that they were hydra-headed monsters which re-appeared in additional numbers. Finally, under the NRA, we legalized them for the time being.<query> what is required to regulate industrial and finance monopolies through the political government?</query> We gave into the hands of code authorites, made up largely of representatives of the industries themselves, the legal right to fix prices and production, in the false no tion that such action would bring back the elusive ""prosperity"" we had lost and lead us to the ""Promised Land of a Balanced Abundance."" We should look across the water to Sweden where they have never fooled themselves by putting an anti-trust 'law on the statute books- They recognized from the beginning that they could not effectively control .private-profit 'business by any laws passed by the political gov ernment. Instead, what did they do? There ought to be a lesson in their ex perience for the United States since they have actually busted the trusts and are on (he way to the elimination of unem ployment, poverty and tenancy.<query> why did we give into the hands of code authorites</query> Tompkins, Dr. J.

By fixing lower prices for food, goods and services, private-profit business is also forced to follow the co operative yardstick and lower prices to consumers. By organizing consumers', Producers' and public cooperatives in Sweden, the people have thus set up co operative price and pay yardsticks which Private-profit business must follow.<query> why is sweden a good place to work</query> What has been the result? Everyone Ho can should go to Sweden and see lrst hand. It will inspire you to find there March, 1938 mends to solve the economic diseases which they diagnosed. In Sweden they have busted the price, pay and profit-fix ing monopolies in margarine, flour, ga loshes, electric lamps, electric power transportation and communication. They have proven that the people have in their own hands the power to organize demo cratically to solve the economic evils which beset them. The same Jesuits can be found in Fin land. There they have eliminated unem ployment. They claim to have reduced the spread in .the standard of living be tween the well-to-do and the poor to such an extent that the well-to-do live on no 43 higher standard than the Soviet officials o =, al business of $1,530,000,000.<query> what has been the result of the jesuits</query> They h°n"" developed principally in the fruit, livestock, dairy and cotton fields.' have become an effective factor in nating waste in the handling of their ucts up to .the principal processing stao and by group marketing have increased the pay to farm producers. Labor • again in a great organizational drive and numbers in its ranks over seven millio members in all. By group bargaining la bor has, like organized farmers, pushed up the pay level. On the side of organi zation as producers, we are on the way in America to push up the pay line for both farmers and labor and distribute amonq producers generally the excess savinqs which now go into the pockets of the few as the result of too low pay to producers Consumers' Cooperation As a whole, we are only getting start ed organizing as consumers.<query> why did organized labor push up the pay level</query> Since or ganizing as consumers means going into business, rather than becoming members of a bargaining organization, it is not pos sible to successfully develop Consumers' Cooperatives by great drives- The people must begin by studying how to run busi nesses on Rochdale cooperative princi ples, then they must learn by practice how to perform for themselves the func tions of distribution and production of finished products which we have turned over to private middlemen, who now act between us as producers and consumers. However, even though we are only now purchasing a little more than 1% of our food and goods cooperatively, we have began to prove to ourselves that we, in America, can build up powerful coopera tives as they have done in Scandinavian and other countries. After many false starts over the past half century, the farmers finally started on the right road in dead earnest after the war.<query> what is the definition of cooperative</query> They now purchase one-eighth or \2]/2% of their farm supplies cooperatively. They have developed, largely in the past ten years. 29 large wholesale groups, each of which does a minimum volume o'f over a million dollars. They have entered principally in to the handling of feed, seed and fertilizer in the East and petroleum products in the Central West. They have developed strong cooperative associations in f Consumers' Cooperation tojnobile, fire and life insurance fields- Jrijey are now increasingly entering into .L. field of cooperative purchasing of , usehold needs such as groceries and electrical appliances. City residents have only begun to be roused to the need of organizing as con- 3ufflers into cooperatives within the past few years. The reason probably is due to the fact that the cities did not feel the full force of depression until after 1929, while farmers have had to undergo it since 1920.<query> what is the cooperative industry</query> By the false foundation of credits to foreign countries and the stimu lation of installment selling, we kept our factory production going and our pay rolls up from 1920 to 1929, when farm prices were constantly depressed. How ever, after the first shock of 1929 had worn off and city residents began to real ize that we were in for a permanent de pression under the present economic or der, they began to hunt for real remedies and are learning that they can lower the prices they pay for food, goods and ser vices 'by consumer cooperative organiza tion. A wave of interest developed and consumers' cooperative grocery stores and oil stations have been organized in many cities. Enough time has passed to indicate that city people can operate their own businesses as organized consumers, as rural residents have previously proven. While the number of cooperative stores and oil -stations in cities is small, they are germs of the new cooperative economic society that is developing.<query> when did the first shock of 1929 wear off</query> It has only been fifteen years since farmers started their first cooperative oil station and now there are over 2,000 of them. There is no reason to assume that city consumers cannot and will not develop cooperatives in increasing numbers from now on- Another principal need in organizing as consumers is to develop cooperative financial institutions such as Credit Unions and Cooperative Banks. Public Cooperation We have made a start in organizing Publicly Owned Utilities. We accept without question public ownership of the post office, schools, libraries, roads and parks. We have largely converted our water-works into Public Utilities. We are increasingly doing the same with electric plants in the cities and are or ganizing rural electric cooperatives among the farmers. The TVA is an electric public utility on a regional basis, which is unquestionably the forerunner of other regional developments. There is a growing tendency towards converting our transportation and communication systems into Public Utilities as has been largely done in Europe.<query> what is the role of public utilities in the economy</query> A second major type of public coopera tion, in addition to Public Utilities, which we need to develop much further is the organization of Social Services in fields of accident, unemployment and old age. Willingness, Knowledge and Action Three things only are needed to en able us all to live in a world of plenty here on this earth. The first necessity is for us to be willing to accept economic justice. A French cooperative film has this challenging title, ""When Mankind is Willing."" The second necessity is for us to increase our knowledge. The solu tions are comparatively simple, once they are desired and understood. With wil lingness and knowledge, action in the way of organization of Consumers* Co operatives, Public Utilities, Farm Coop eratives and Labor Unions to achieve plenty for all and peace on earth will most naturally result.<query> what is the necessity of a cooperative</query> COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH Columbus, Ohio — The Cooperative Life Insurance Company of America wrote more than $6,000,000 worth of life insurance in 1937 bringing the total amount of cooperative life insurance in force to well over $20,000,000. New York — Four cooperative health associations are in the process of forma- ""°n in and around New York City, the 1938 Bureau of Cooperative Medicine an nounced this week. These associations are located in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Nassau Coun ty. Plans of these organizations are unique in that preventive medicine and health education are to be stressed. It is expected that the associations will grow rapidly. 45 Governors Lehman of New York, Benson of Minnesota and Aiken of Vermont FOUR GOVERNORS ENDORSE CONSUMER COOPERATIVES New York—George D. Aiken, Gover nor of Vermont, became the fourth gov ernor to recognize publicly the impor tance of cooperatives for the develop ment of economic security and social progress when he endorsed the organiza tion of marketing and consumer coopera tives in an article in the February issue of the Ohio Farm Bureau News.<query> where are cooperative health associations located</query> The future of our country depends on two groups—the Farmer and the Laborer. They have strength as never before. This was shown in the last national election and was reflected in the laws passed by the ""New Deal"" Congress. Dr. Dawber says, ""Farmers as producers and consumers must join hands with the industrial workers who are also producers and consumers, to bridge the gulf between production and consumption."" But, ""agri culture is still the primary industry. Upon its economic strength the nation's economic life will finally depend."" This economic strength is not very high just now, however. Within the past twenty years one million two hundred thousand farmers have either lost their farms or have been reduced to tenancy. ""Many and varied are the schemes being tried to meet the baffling problems of our economic life. During recent years the government has sent to this task an army of specialists, but in the end the farmer must solve his own economic problems.""

Of particular interest was the non- partisan complexion of the group which included Republican, Democratic, Pro gressive and Farm-Labor governors. Governor Aiken emphasized the im portance of the close relation of market ing and consumer co-ops when he de clared: ""I believe the only safety for the dairymen of New England lies in looking forward to and planning for the time when they, by themselves or in cooperation with the con sumers, will distribute a far greater percentage of their products in the city market than they are doing today. ""The Governor of New York is not radical. He is considered as hard-headed and practical a businessman as there is in the State, yet in his message to the New York Legislature last week he advocated the establishment of con sumer cooperatives for the distribution of milk in the cities."" Governor Lehman's endorsement of co-ops followed the failure of both state and producer control to give a fair price to -the farmer without an exhorbitant price to the consumer.<query> who is governor of new york</query> In his message to the legislature he said: 46 ""There can be no satisfactory solution of the milk problem, either under state or ' dustry control, if the milk of the producer is not made available to the consumer at a price he can afford to pay. ""Establishment of consumer cooperatives for direct distribution of milk from producer to consumer should be definitely encouraged These undertakings could be made yardsticks for the measurement of fair and just distribu tion costs. Their results, supplementing pre vious inquiries and the present audit of the company books, should provide the practical information on price spread that has hitherto not been available. Properly operated con sumer cooperatives can supply milk at better retail prices and yet not impair a fair return to the producer."" Governor LaFollette set aside the week of February 14-18 as Wisconsin Coop erative Week, declaring in his official proclamation: ""Today, more than ever, it is recognized that many of our problems must be solved by the people themselves, working together in general educational, commodity marketing and purchasing groups.<query> when is cooperative milk week</query> ""To take inventory of the important part that cooperation is playing in the economic and social welfare of our .people and to emphasize the possibilities of service through cooperative action, Wisconsin Cooperative Week will be observed from February H to 18 of this year."" Governor Benson, speaking at the Tenth Anniversary of Midland Coopera tive Wholesale last year, continued his long-standing endorsement of the coop erative movement by asserting that: ""Through the development of. cooperatives farmers and laborers can build economic machinery which, together with progressive political parties and labor unions, will protect them against the rise of fascism and coffl- I CO-OPS SHOW 23.6% GAIN Seven of the consumers' cooperative •holesale associations affiliated with The Operative League, which have re- Orted to date, show an increase of 5J4 million dollars in 1937, bringing the ""ear's total to $27,551,759-23.6% above their volume for the previous year.<query> when is cooperative week in wisconsin</query> The seven cooperative wholesales serve more than a thousand retail coop ératives from Massachusetts to Colorado and .handle petroleum products, groceries and general farm supplies.

Number of fixed prices later unfixed—about 500,000."" New York City is also talking about fixing bread prices. We Americans have the demo cratic right to repeat the economic mis takes which England did a hundred years ago in attempting to fix prices by legal enactment if we wish to do so, but far more rapid progress could be made if we would study history and take advantage of the experience of others.<query> who said war is hell</query> * * * ""Vast numbers of our farming popula tion live in a poverty more abject than that of many of the farmers of Europe whom we are wont to call peasants."" So said President Roosevelt. Such farmers are not the owners of farms but the tenants. The primary job for farmers is to recover ownership. The government could give farms away at one time but the government cannot in sure permanent ownership. Only farmers themselves can do that. Scandinavian farmers have shown how to recover ownership—it's quite simple after all— by organizing cooperative finance, coop erative marketing and cooperative pur chasing associations. By these methods Danish farmers have recovered owner ship of their farms when they once had 50 the same percentage of tenancy a now have—42%; Finnish farmers h ' already reduced tenancy from 60 to Qe?e Tenancy is on the way out in Scand°' navia.<query> how do scandinavian farmers recover ownership</query> It can also be eliminated in Am ica by the same methods. er~ * * * It is admitted that there is one new paper in England which has proven to h"" more nearly right in its interpretations than perhaps any other, namely, ""TU Manchester Guardian.""

The politicians are a broken reed; a great part of the business world has forgotten the lessons of 1929-33- the economists, to judge by their answers to a recent questionnaire, are in their accus tomed disharmony.""

The rapid devel opment of Labor Unions did not prevent an increase in prices even higher than the increases in pay nor another orgy of profit-piling with its inevitable result in putting the brakes on the wheels of in dustry which caused the layoff of mil lions. The increase in Farm Marketing Cooperatives did not prevent monopoly processors of farm produce charging higher prices to consumers than was .justified by the higher pay to producers. Middleman Monopoly increasingly re duced the purchasing power of the people.

Once in a ""blue moon"" we come upon a newspaper editorial that helps us. The New York Times editor wrote one re cently under the heading ""Years are as we make them."" Briefly summarized he said: ""Man's fate is no longer dependent upon the niggardliness or generosity of the earth ... man's fate depends ,upon himself ... We have arrived at one of those decisive moments in history which come every thousand years or so and we are perhaps on the eve of a new synthesis—a new putting together of creative ideas . . .<query> who said years are as we make them</query> Out of chaos one certainly emerges —that to build things up rather than tear them down can be accomplished only by consent arising out of the liberation of the human spirit. We need to evoke all the thinking powers, all the imaginative qualities, all the adventurousness of which 'humanity is ca pable, and that cannot be done by any sys tem of repression, under whatever name. It is not a forced and make-believe 'Unanimity that will save us—but the free pouring forth of the genius of the race. We come closest to that ideal in our democracies, however imper fect they may te. Democracy is life. Autoc racy, at this stage of history, is death. And this distinction outlines the great struggle which now shakes the earth. To doubt its outcome is to doubt the basic fact of human nature—the will to live.<query> what is the difference between autocracy and democracy</query> ""Therefore we can move forward with hope, if only the free peoples of free nations, and the peoples of nations struggling to be free, will unite their moral forces.

Blind Leaders of the Blind Our most prominent businessmen ad mit that they are unable to understand the working of the private-profit system under which they operate. General Robert E. Wood, president of Sears, Roebuck. & Co., was asked to forecast the future of industry when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Unem ployment and Relief. He admitted his failure as a forecaster by saying that last summer he felt that business would re main good and went off on a six-weeks hunting trip, ""and when I came back I found I was 100% wrong."" President William S. Knudsen of Gen eral Motors, in testifying before the same committee, also admitted his failure as a forecaster.<query> who was the president of sears roebuck</query> ""I don't think anybody in God's world could have told me that the outlook was going to drop 50 per cent in two or three weeks."" The American people have the spectacle before them of the presidents of two of our largest busi nesses in America publicly admitting that even they do not understand the work ings of the system of which they control large sections. Yet the reason for the present depression is a simple one. Purchasing power was increased by credits rather than by distribution of cash in pay to farmers and workers for products and services. More was di verted from the stream of purchasing- power flowing to the many, in the form of profits to the few, than the few could consume or invest profitably in new pro ductive enterprises. The increase in pro duction was built up on a false founda tion of credit and had to collapse.<query> why did the economic depression happen</query> The signs of impending collapse were plain last summer in the increase in prices to consumers more than pay to producers, which increased profits and stocik prices. We cannot forever continue an economic system where we have ""blind leaders of the blind."" The people must first open their eyes and learn the facts. Then we will change our unscientific economic system and select understanding leaders. 51 COOPERATIVES AND PEACE How the Cooperative Movement Helps End War TN a world where civilization is in con- -*• stant peril of extinction by war, no question is more often asked than, Which AVay to Peace? War has become so de structive in its methods and so ruinous in its consequences that it is generally rec ognized as the ruling evil of our time. Conversely, the advancement of an order of society where peace is the rule of life becomes a consuming passion for mil lions.<query> how cooperative movement helps end war</query> Imperialism Resurgent In the years between 1932 and 1938, five wars disgraced the name of civiliza tion. Manchuria, the Chaco, Ethiopia, Spain and China—the dismal roll call brings a succession of visions of peace ful societies disrupted, homes destroyed, social reform blocked and wholesale suf fering and death in many lands. And even this is but the beginning of war's misery. The curse of brother's blood on victor's hands paralyses them from en joying the fruits of conquest. As a result great wars follow small wars and big cannons must be forged to defend the gains of little guns. These five wars have one revealing thing in common. They were all wars for economic gain for somebody. They were caused by competitive struggle for war materials, markets, and places for invest ment of idle capital. Manchuria is the rich granary of Asia, and is wealthy in coal, timber and minerals.<query> what were the five wars between 1932 and 1938</query> The swamps of the Chaco conceal oil. Ethiopia pro vides crowded Italy with room for ex pansion. Spain supplies minerals and strategic control of trade routes to the fascist nations which have become in volved in her civil war. China possesses coal and iron and the last great unfenced market on earth. Any social invention therefore that mitigates this blind eco nomic struggle, that .provides great num bers of people with security at home so that their governments are not driven by their desperation into adventures of for eign imperialism, is an aid to peace. For the story of war in the modern world is the monotonous repetition of the same 52 Harold E. pey tale of hunger and struggle and blood th three centuries of history have m j* wearily familiar. e The reasons why governments act tV way are not to be found in themselves8 but in other forces which act on them A ' C. C. Morrison, editor of the influential Christian Century, recently said, ""0 political governments are not our real governments.<query> why do we need social inventions</query> Our governments are them selves governed. There is an invisible government behind our governments-it is our economic system. Our political qov- ernment is but an instrument, a tool of economic forces. And these economic forces inherently make for war . . . The spirit of war dwells in the body of our capitalistic economy, which holds war as the clouds hold lightning."" Cooperatives Build Peace The question. Which Way to Peace? therefore causes increasing numbers of people to look with new eaqerness to the cooperative movement. They discover that cooperatives eliminate competition, redistribute wealth, increase people's security and stabilize economic relation ships. If the cooperative way is not the only way. they ask, may it not be a way, a very important way, toward peace? Aldous Huxley, famous English nov elist, believes it is.<query> what is the cooperative way</query> He says, in his ""Encyclopedia of Pacifism"": ""The cooperative movement has shown that, without violence and even without the backing of state or municipality, private in dividuals can create, in the midst of capitalist surroundings, a flourishing island of non- competitive, non-exploiting, non-profit-malt ing economic activity. Cooperation is applied pacifism. The more widely the application can be made, the better . . . To increase the membership and enlarge the activities of the cooperative movement is work of an es sentially pacifist!« nature."" Before we begin to examine the ways cooperation makes for peace, let us open ly admit that we are not doing so in the hope that we shall thereby quickly end the armament ""race which is consuming wealth four times as rapidly as that which twenty-five years aero was setting the stage for the first World War.<query> what is cooperative movement</query> These two elements cover the entire fields of production and distribu tion. In her pamphlet ""The Discovery of the •Consumer,"" written after forty years of research, Beatrice Webb sums up the significance of a correct analysis of the functions and relationships of producer and consumer groups in these striking words, ""I believe this distinction between the kinds of organization—between As sociations of Producers on the one hand and Associations of Consumers on the other—to be no idle fancy, but perhaps the most pregnant and important piece of classification in the whole range of so ciology."" \Vho Arc Producers? How Arc They Organized? Producers include only a limited num ber of the entire population. Necessarily they must largely omit small children, the sick, the physically and mentally handi capped, and the aged. The constant tend ency of society is to raise the minimum and lower the maximum ages of those whom it expects to be active full-time producers.<query> what is the difference between producers and consumers</query> It Consumers' Cooperation v already be too late to avert a second vj/orld War, but unless we give atten- n to the causes which will go on pro- ! i ein g war so long as they are un- uched, we shall not even be able to vert a third. It is high time we begin at the right end. l Cooperatives Increase Individual Security To millions of men who are haunted hy fear of unemployment, forever de feated in the effort to ""make ends meet"" on inadequate incomes, often out of work for months at a time, war comes as an opportunity to find certainty if not se curity, to enjoy social approval and to have new and probably not fatal ex periences whic'h music, art and history cover with a glamor of romantic half- truths. Unemployed men who have been weighted down with a sense that they are of no use to the world suddenly discover a piece of work that people want them to do.<query> why do cooperatives increase individual security</query> Is it any wonder that millions sud denly glow with pride and hungrily sieze the chance to warm themselves in the novel glow of public favor? The bearing of mass poverty on na tional policy is widely recognized. Pover ty produces social unrest. Governments can escape the political consequences of social unrest by drastic reorganization of the domestic economy which will put mil- I lions to work and redistribute wealth through heavy taxation. But the people who would have to pay the bills have large influence in government, so gov ernments sometimes adopt as an alterna tive a belligerent foreign policy which will make people forget their misery by I threats against another nation, war preparations and even war. In all countries where it has secured an appreciable foothold, the cooperative movement has lifted the level of eco nomic life and so made war less attrac tive or likely, Denmark two generations ago was a nation of debt-ridden folk, Denmark has now one of the highest standards of living on the continent of Europe, She has not engaged in a recent war even though the great conflict of 1914-1918 raged all around her.<query> what is the bearing of poverty on policy</query> In a world involved in a fiercely competitive arms race she has reduced her armed forces to police status. APril , 1938 Sweden is undercutting war by increas ing individual security. Unemployment has been eliminated and poverty of the demoralizing, disintegrative severity we know has been abolished. Sweden also has been at peace for generations. The choice before civilization appears to be ""jobs or war."" II. Cooperatives Work Against Concentration of Wealth A second way in which cooperation; builds peace is through the wide distribu tion of profits. The cooperative move ment does not attack the profit motive as such. The patronage dividend which the consumer receives consists of money he saves. The appeal to thrift is vastly less dangerous to society than the temptation to profit, which may easily produce anti social results. The clearest example of how the un checked profit motive leads to war is pro vided by the munition-makers.<query> how cooperatives work</query> After the Senate Munitions Inquiry where their bloody activities came to light, these profiteers were unforgettably named, ""merchants of death."" In Great Britain, the Cooperative Party which has had nine members in Parliament recently, has pledged itself ""to work for abolition of all profit in the manufacturing and supply of war materials and munitions."" They were moved by revelations of the Senate Munitions Inquiry whic'h revealed war profits up to 1700 per cent by munition makers here, and by their own parlia mentary commission's study which showed the same rapacious disregard for human welfare. As a by-product the cooperative move ment contributes to peace by preventing, the formation of great, soulless corpora tions whose search for profits may lead to war. Most people have failed to realize the sinister significance of the fact that a great American oil company has been in volved in three of the five recent impe rialist wars.<query> what is the cooperative party</query> In the Chaco, it helped fi nance one side of a struggle over oil lands; in Ethiopia it made a daring at tempt to snatch the fruits of conquest away from Mussolini; in China it sent its tankers through the war zone and got them sumk with the Panay. This is why Professor C. Bougie recently asked, ""Is it not indeed obvious that the dangerous 53 .armaments race is a distant but logical consequence of the race for profits as carried on in the midst of the economic .anarchy of today, so often denounced and detested by the prophets of coopera tion? Is there any need to point out that the wars which desolate the world arise automatically from the pursuit of profit and are egged on by large scale industry from the aggravated competition between great powers themselves for raw ma- ' ' i ' I terials and markets?"" III.<query> why is the dangerous race for armaments a distant but logical consequence of the race Cooperatives Develop Cooperative Attitudes The death grip which the outworn so cial habit of war has upon people can be explained in part by the accustomed atti tudes which a competitive economic sys tem develops. Under our system most men are constantly engaged in a life- and-death struggle for a living. Their hands must necessarily be against their fellow men, for they can only succeed by triumphing over competitors. One or the other is constantly facing ruin, as the staggering percentage of bankruptcies in most lines of business reveals. ""Success"" comes to the shrewdest, the most ruth less, often the most unscrupulous. It is much less likely to smile on the man who renders the most outstanding public serv ice than it is on the exploiter who is most adroit in discovering ways of making the public pay him the biggest profit. This develops in men's minds those attitudes ""which are necessary to successful compe tition: secrecy, skill in analyzing the weakness of an opponent, ability in maneuvering him into a position of dis advantage, adroitness in discovering ""soft spots"" in the consumer's defences, capacity for ""breaking down sales re sistance,"" for giving an appearance of value without its substance, for making the largest possible profit over the long est period of time.<query> what is the definition of cooperative</query> It is this fighting frame of mind which provides the spiritual climate of war. This is the reason why most men, when war comes, so easily slip into a war psychol ogy. They are so inured to competition, to struggle for advantage, that without a shift of gears, so naturally they do not pause to wonder at themselves, they drop the cloak of civilization and after a little """"hardening"" in military camps are ready for the frightful carnage of war. 54 Cooperation trains men in another of life—a way in which the good Of s ciety and not the selfish advantage of tT"" individual is supreme. It brings to rt surface an entirely different set of • tudes. The cooperator succeeds onl& *'"" the whole group finds its highest welT being. He is judged by his ability to dis cover and supply real needs, by his abT~ ty to work with others and to get oth '"" to work together and by his genius T* bring cooperation to ever widening circles of people.<query> what is cooperation</query> So while competition provides the spiritual climate for war co operation naturally develops the way of life that makes for peace. IV. Cooperatives Strengthen and Extend Democracy A fourth way in which the cooperative movement makes for peace is its effect in strengthening democracy and extending democratic processes from the political to the economic fields. The ""one man - one vote"" principle of democratic control runs through the cooperative movement from top to bottom. Its members know they cannot force decisions by buying up control or amassing proxies, but must in stead rely on the democratic methods of education and persuasion. Learning the habit of democracy, they apply self-rule to a local business, the consumers' coop erative store. Beginning here it extends by natural steps into the wholesale, then links up with related fields, and eventually joins hands across the seas with other similar enterprises in interna tional trade.<query> how cooperatives strengthen democracy</query> There can be no doubt in these days of dictatorships of left and right that de mocracy is needed as a bulwark of peace. But democratic government itself is hard beset, less by outward threats from dic tators than by the action of corrosive acids acting from within. Unless the co operative and similar movements can ex tend the health-giving principle of de mocracy from the political life deep into the economic habits of the country, a corroding industrial autocracy will de stroy even political democracy, and witij it our hopes for peace. A combination of ""democracies,"" which strangely always includes Russia when it is proposed, to crush fascism by military force is the surest way to guarantee that fascism wul take control of us all. For America there not be the slightest doubt of this be- C3 se the blueprint of how it is done is Cf Industrial Mobilization Plan.<query> why is de mocracy necessary</query> This f tne armed services of the United States was unearthed by the Munitions Inquiry. It provides point-by- int for a complete military dictator- 'hiP. not on'y in mi'itary affairs, but in jhe whole life of the country. It is so worded that it may be perpetuated in finitely after the war is over, so that r ascjsm, once intrenched in an emer- nency, may extend the emergency so long L it desires. Protection and extension of democracy within America is therefore of primary importance and any agency such as the cooperative movement which advances this process is integral to peace. V. Cooperatives Organize International Peace Cooperation also builds peace because it is organized on international lines, is lead by peace-minded men and has a great educational program that promotes understanding. It is often said that ""co operation knows no frontiers, no limita tion of color, race or creed."" It is deeply significant that the International Coop erative Alliance, formed by groups in thirty countries, was the onlv organiza tion that maintained contact between all its members during the World War.<query> why is cooperative organization important</query> The years of production are being shortened at both ends. As society has developed through the ages, three general groups of producers have evolved. They are commonly termed: farmer, labor and professional. Farm producers' organizations have adopted the name ""Farm Cooperatives."" Labor producers' organizations use the name ""Labor Unions."" Professional pro ducers' organizations call themselves ""Professional Associations."" It has been suggested that it would be better if all producers' organizations would adopt the same surname and call themselves ""Un ions""—that is ""Farm Unions,"" ""Labor Unions"" and ""Professional Unions""— and leave to consumers' organizations the use of the word ""Cooperative"" and to social organizations the use of the word ""Association."" By so doing, a dis cussion of the relationship of consumers, producers and social groups would K greatly clarified.<query> what is the difference between a labor organization and a farm cooperative</query> Nearly one hundred million people are associated in the cooperative movement throughout the world, and the number is rapidly increasing. In Great Britain alone 28.000,000 neople are actively affiliated with it. In Finland over 30% of the retail business is done through cooperatives. Over one-third of the people of Sweden 1 are members. In Denmark cooperation has reduced farm tenancy from 42% to 3% of the farms. Conclusion In these desperate days, friends of peace are deeply distressed. The day by day threat of the collapse of civilization in the incalculable disaster of war keeps 1 us concentrated on moves which will re lieve the immediate crisis. But may it not be the wisest statesmanship in the long run to give equal and unflagging atten tion to those basic adjustments which will stop this cycle of one crisis after another which in the end can only result in war?<query> how many people are involved in cooperatives</query> ""• is to those whose concern is with the Consumers' Cooperation April, 1938 long view that the cooperative movement is most attractive as a road to peace. Slowly mankind is learning that the means we use determines the end we realize. In that insight we see the futility and self-defeating nature of all military methods. War, coercion, brutality can only reproduce themselves. No matter how holy the purpose behind it, war can only end in more war. So we say ""Goodby to all that"" and turn to the better way of cooperative en deavor. The League of Nations, having at long last apparently 'been forced to drop from its covenant those provisions which made it too an instrument of mili tary coercion, may now emerge as the qreat channel of cooperative endeavor for peace which it was intended in the first place to become.<query> what was the cooperative movement</query> In the meantime we can support such constructive moves as the Van Zeeland proposal, in which governments are shown by the ex-premier of Belgium a practical and constructive way to lower tariffs, stabilize currencies, eliminate quota restrictions and move toward a world economic conference instead of a world war. We can all in our own communities begin to develop islands of sanity and co operation. A cooperative buying club, store or credit union may not at first glance appear to be a very effective chan nel to world peace. But experience shows that its possibilities are very great and are in-creasing rapidly as the cooperative movement itself develops a growing sense of awareness and responsibility for activity in behalf of world peace to add to its passion for social and economic iustice. By increasing individual security, by widening the distribution of wealth instead of helping its concentration, by developing cooperative attitudes, by strengthening and extending democracy and by its growing international out reach, the cooperative movement offers a practical way to peace.<query> what is the cooperative movement</query> Its wide exten sion makes it available to any person who wants to add his bit in a struggle in which not only democracy and freedom but the lives of ourselves and our chil dren are at stake. Its unimpeachable ethical basis entitles it to the support of men of good will and its sound economic procedures give it the right to claim the respect of practical people everywhere. 55 ! l LABOR AND COOPERATION Mark Starr Educational E"" IpAULTS on both sides have in the past •*• prevented harmonious relations and joint action between the cooperative movement and organized labor in the United States. The trade unions during the .so-called prosperity period before 1929 were only anxious to secure high wages and were inclined to shut their eyes to larger social aims. In some instances, local unions be came job trusts which entered into co operation with the employers in order to •share in monopoly prices.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> Trade union ists ignored the fact that high wages were not a permanent benefit to the workers if they were accompanied by high prices and inferior quality of goods. Labor's only recognition of the consumer was to ask him to buy trade union label goods and services. Trade unionists shortsightedly believed that they could, by their economic organization alone, suc cessfully get for themselves a share in the increased productivity of labor. They forgot that the machine might replace them completely. Not By Cooperation Alone On the other side many cooperators in the United .States have been exceedingly naive. They have been ""pure and simple"" cooperators who thought that trade un ions and workers' political action were unimportant. They have indulged in the vision of being able to buy out the com petitive system solely by accumulating their retail trade savings. They .have been trying to raise themselves by pulling at their own shoe-strings, and in the United States very weak shoe-strings at that.<query> why did trade unionists believe that the economy could be improved by cooperation alone?</query> Cooperators who think that only by co operation can the workers emancipate themselves are unrealistic. All the capital and assets of the cooperative movement in the United States are only a very tiny fraction of the capital and assets owned by such great corporations as General Motors and the U. S. Steel. Only in a Utopian dream can we see the coopera tive movement acquiring ownership of 56 Int'l Ladies Garment Workers TT • the railroads. The public ownershin the basic resources is a matter for t^ whole community using its c powers and not for a voluntary associa tion of individual consumers. Touching Points Having said all that, the question arises as to what are the touching points between organizations of consumers and organizations of workers. We cannot ignore in this the experience of other countries. In my own experience, I have seen strikes in Britain carried through to a successful finish because the coopera tives gave the unions credit and sold bread and other necessities at cost during the strike period.<query> what is the touching point between cooperatives and labor organizations</query> When the five big banks in the general strike of 1926 re fused to liquefy the assets of trade unions, it was the Cooperative Wholesale So ciety Bank which came through and is sued checks cashable in food at the co operative nation-wide stores. It was the cooperative movement in England which first gave the biscuit workers the 8-hour day. It is chiefly the sales clerks in the cooperative movement who are at the moment organized in the distributive trade in Great Britain. When the ""divi dends"" of the cooperative movement were under attack by jealous Big Business, the cooperators set up a political party and this political party has worked in close cooperation in the House of Commons with the Labour Party. These are only a few instances of co operation between the unions and the co operative movement drawn from the facts of life.<query> what was the cooperative movement</query> The CIO All that has happened recently in the great upsurge of labor organization strengthens the need for a closer working arrangement between the labor unions and the cooperative movement. The workers newly organized in the mass production industries are less likely than Consumers' Cooperation . Old-line unions to attempt to set up ob trust. They will be more interested 3 action as citizens and as voters to se- '""re through political pressure adequate cU]ief for the unemployed, maximum 1 rking hours and minimum wages. They a'so ^e interested to build up \ redit unions to help their members through hard times; to build up coopera tives to help their members cope with monopoly prices and increases in the cost Of living. It is noteworthy that in two of the industries organized by the CIO there have been dramatic speed-ups. In steel, 15000 workers in the continuous strip 01Î1 can do the work of 100,000 em ployed in 'the hand mill.<query> what is the role of the cio in labor organization</query> In the making of class, there has been a trebling of pro duction while man power has been re duced by one- fifth. In 1925 the ribbon of class six feet wide travelled 42 inches a minute on the Pittsburgh Plate belt. To day it travels 120 inches a minute and the number of workers on the production end is 20% lower than it was in 1925. Even the well organized printing in dustry is menaced by the teletype-setter. The A. F. of L. Influenced by the extensive publicity and growth of the cooperative movement, the American Federation of Labor and some of its unions have lately displayed a greater interest in cooperation. Its con ventions in 1936 and 1937 endorsed Con sumers Cooperation. The American Fed- erationist articles in the March, April, May, 1937, issues, have been reprinted as ""An Idea Worth Hundreds of Dol lars."" The journals of the railroad brotherhoods have devoted considerable attention to cooperative advances.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> Trade union locals are setting up credit unions, cooperative gas stations and grocery stores as a beginning in cooperative methods. The Farmers In the United States hitherto, the farm ers have been more interested in setting up cooperatives than have trade union- •s's. Now there is renewed interest in farmer-labor parties. Certainly if labor is going to become a political force in the United States, it will have to secure the cooperation of the farmers. The cooper- il, 1938 ative movement provides the means whereby the organized farmers and the organized wage-workers can be brought together. At present there are consider able misunderstandings. I quote from a recent letter written by a farmer woman living in Montana: ""Why don't the labor unions fight about that (refunding processing taxes) instead of starting a boycott when the price of meat goes high?<query> when did the farmer's movement start</query> e Fundamentally there is no reason wli every producer should not be a memh ^ of the organized vocational groun *( which he is a part. In no other way his interests as a producer be fully rer) a° sented in any negotiations with consume"" groups. There should be, as Beatrice Webb phrases it, a ""ubiquitous (Omni present) organization ^ of the producers by hand or by brain."" ""Who Are Consumers? How Are They Organized? While producers include only a limited and ever decreasing percentage of the population, as we have seen, on the con trary consumers include everybody. A child consumes even before it is born and the aged until their last breath. Neither sickness nor any physical or mental •handicap eliminates anyone from the ranks of consumers. When individual consumers began or ganizing to supply their needs and repre sent their joint interests as consumers in negotiating with organizations of pro ducers, they first of all developed volun tary types of organizations.<query> who are consumers</query> We need the cooperation of la boring men. Instead of boycotting meat be cause it is high priced, why don't they co operate and buy direct? There are little meat packing plants in Montana, right in the middle of the live stock area. I don't doubt they would be tickled pink at an order for a car load of meat from a labor union. "".... a labor union could put in a lot of time profitably by studying how to buy eco nomically instead of always crying for higher wages. I haven't any doubt but the em ployers of large groups need some lessons but many times when the laborers are trying to punish them, they give more punishment to .the people who consume the goods they are producing and who should be their well-wish ers. If the laboring men could get It in their heads that the farmers have to have an ade quate price for their products before they can buy manufactured goods, the laborers would have a better market for their products and more employment."" Here then is an unsolicited suggestion of .how<query> why do laborers boycott meat</query> the workers in the towns, through their distributive cooperatives, could set up mutual beneficial relations with the organized farmers. And economic joint action would lead to political cooperation as citizens. Labor is Both Producer and Consumer There are members of the trade union movement who are too radical to con sider cooperatives. They are, perhaps, more than balanced by cooperators who have failed to see the necessity of limking themselves with the labor movement and of building up political organizations in conjunction with workers of hand and brain to protect themselves in a Fascist- menaced world. However, mutual accu- 'sations of shortsightedness in the past should not prevent us from being more farsighted for the future and certainly there is ample opportunity for joint action between workers as consumers and as trade unionists. 57 NEW NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR THE COOPERATIVES TOURING the last few months the Con- -""-^ sumers Cooperative Movement has received national recognition from im portant bodies in the fields of religion, politics, education and peace action— recognition to which it has long been en titled as a nationwide movement of con sumers seeking to build by democratic means the economic security and eco nomic freedom of the people.<query> what is the role of labor in the cooperative movement</query> Religion Just before the close of 1937 prominent religious leaders set up the Committee on the Church and Cooperatives as a divi sion of the Industrial Section of the Fed eral Council of the Churches of Christ in America. This action was paralleled by the formation of a special Cooperative Committee of the National Catholic Ru ral Life Conference. Education In the educational field, the National Education Association implemented its interest in cooperatives by appointing a national Cooperative Committee made up of prominent members of the association. Political In the fields of political action, the ap pointment by President Roosevelt of the Inquiry on Cooperative Enterprise in Europe which reported early in 1937 was followed by a visit to the offices of The Cooperative League of the U. S. A. by Mrs. Roosevelt in December. The Senate Committee on Unemployment and Relief invited E. R. Bowen, general secretary of The Cooperative League to testify at its hearings March 16 as to the effect of cooperatives in stabilizing employment, investment and business volumes.<query> what was the effect of cooperatives on the economy</query> Mr. Bowen presented statistical evidence ' showing an increase of 20% in the busi ness of the major cooperative wholesales in the U.

P fatlve Peace The National Peace Conference coo dinating body of the Peace movement i~ the United States, arranged for Jame Myers, secretary of the Committee on the ^Church and Cooperatives, to speak on ""Cooperatives and Peace"" as one of a series of nationwide radio broadcasts February 26.

A half century ago Kristian l\ Ostergaard, a young Danish educator and writer, sat alone in his study and hummed the tune of an old folksong. He was almost ill from overwork, and he faced the prospect of failure in his chosen vocation; but courage and faith were strong in him. The rhythm of the tune began to emerge with his thoughts. Tentatively, seizing pen and paper, he wrote a line—and then a second—a new song had been born. Many years later the song was translated. It became known as ""That Cause Can Neither Be Lost Nor Stayed"" and is often sung by educational and coopera tive groups. The son of a Danish farmer, Kristian Ostergaard was edu cated chiefly in the folk schools of Denmark.<query> who wrote that cause can neither be lost nor stayed</query> In 1878 he came to the United States to serve as a teacher in Danish-American folk schools. He remained seven years —long enough to help found two such schools; but increasingly homesick, he returned to Den mark in the spring of 1885.

In time men learned the advantage of carrying on such functions as voluntary groups of consumers. It was later found that it was inadvisable to depend alto gether upon voluntary organizations in some fields—that a ;policeman could not well ask a citizen who was being slugged whether he belonged to a voluntary pro tective organization, which hired the policeman, before helping him; that the fireman could not wait to ascertain if the house on fire was insured in the volun tary fire association which employed him: that there was no good reason for laying a water main past the house of a citizen and permitting him to refuse to pay his share of the cost.<query> what was voluntary organization</query> St. Louis—In spite of constant attacks by the officials of organized medicine m St. Louis, the Wage Earners Health Association showed important progress during the past year.

Consumers' Cooperation BOOK REVIEWS /--operation — An American Way, by John Daniels, Covici Friede and Co., New York, 1938, 400 pages $3.00. (Special Cooperative League Edition, $1.50). Tohn Daniels, writer, sociologist and former cretary of the English Speaking Union, has ^ded in ""Cooperation — An American Way"" an ?<query> average number of phone calls per month for healthcare</query> teresting. and enthusiastic, and yet a careful ap- '""aisal of the American consumers cooperative '""ovement to the rather impressive bookshelf of """"operative literature which has appeared in the last few years- Ifa Daniels is one of the generation of hard- headed realists to whom the fact that European cooperatives had made great progress was no (oof that cooperatives would succeed here unless L could put his hands and eyes and ears on an American movement. So last summer and fall he set out to see if, where, what and why there were co-ops in America. Without benefit of Rochdale, of C. W. S., of Konsum or the Finnish cooperatives, he has dis covered a remarkable story. From their premature birth in Boston in 1845 (Mr. Daniels researches have moved the date for ward to 1844, matching the opening of the store in Rochdale) the story of the American co-ops moves rapidly 'through their promotion by the Grange and the Knights of Labor in the late 1800s and the ""new Americans"" after the turn of the century.<query> when did the cooperatives start</query> General farm organization activities, mutual fire insurance societies, marketing coopera tives and political democracy built the psycholog ical and organizational basis for the American consumers cooperative movement. And from con sumers cooperative purchase of farm supplies Mr. Daniels shows tbe natural and, for him, inevitable evolution to the purchasing of home supplies. Mr. Daniels has made a particularly valuable contribution in what started out to be incidental research. He found out that the average farmer spends more for food, clothing and other con sumers goods than he does for gas and oil and general farm supplies with which to raise his crops. This reversal of a commonly accepted be lief shows an enormous field for expansion of the purchase of consumers goods, to match the annual cooperative purchase of nearly $400,000,000 worth of farm supplies. Statistically the American movement has achieved respectable proportions.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative purchase movement</query> Taken together, the membership of all types of consumer cooper atives adds up to more than 5,000,000 consumers. Duplication of membership to allow for enthusias tic cooperators who belong to several coopera tives reduces this total considerably — exactly how much nobody knows. But Mr. Daniels found the co-ops financially and psychologically sound and «ang business in almost every type of activity and at almost every crossroad from Maine to Minneapolis. ™r- Daniels points out the exploitation of the Consumer under the profit system and declares that j Progression from profit to profiteering and /?? Profiteering to racketeering is almost inevi- ™fe He does not ""huff and puff and blow the OUSe down,"" but rather traces the growth of the 1938 cooperatives as they replace sections of the profit system. For him ""consumers cooperation is a form of socio-economic organization which is now in •the process of evolution as a mutation of capital ism.<query> who discovered the concept of cooperatives</query> It is not an instrument for the overthrow of capitalism, but an implement to make capitalism •work."" John Daniels was a classmate of President Roosevelt's in Harvard, directed neighborhood re search in Boston, Rochester and other cities for the Carnegie Corporation for several years and was secretary of the English Speaking Union, an organization to encourage friendly relations between English speaking countries, from 1921 to 1934. His other books were ""America Via the Neighborhood"" and in ""Freedom's Birthplace."" Consumers' Cooperation in Great Britain, by A. M. Carr-SaundeTS, P. Sargent Florence, Robert Peers and others. George Alien and Unwin Ltd., Publishers, London, 1938. 556 pages, $4.50. (Order thru The Cooperative League). Ever since the days of Charles Gide, economists have paid little or no attention to the Cooperative Movement.<query> who was john daniels</query> Few indeed have been their attempts to evaluate its economic and social significance. The frantic search for solutions to the problems of world wide depressions and the steady expan sion of Cooperative activity in spite of .these same depressions is forcing upon economists this long neglected analysis. Cooperators themselves are partially to blame for this neglect and for the re sulting failure to get even an inadequate presenta tion of cooperation in our schools. Most coopera tive literature has originated within the Coopera tive Movement and as a consequence it has been looked upon as a more or less biased presentation of the cooperative viewpoint. It is no wonder, therefore, that economists and governmental of ficials have not given it serious consideration in the past. This study of ""Consumers' Cooperation in Great Britain"" fills the need that has long existed for an impartial analysis by a group of outstanding econ omists and sociologists.<query> what is the cooperative movement</query> The authors disclose many of the •weaknesses of cooperation in practice which have been glossed over in so many of the existing books on the subject and at the same time they substantiate many cooperative accomplish ments which economists hesitated to accept when they read of .them in the literature of the move ment. In fact, some of the conclusions in respect to the efficiency of cooperative retail distribution are so startlingly favorable that cooperators hesi tate to accept them. For example, economists and business men will find much food for thought in .the discussion of the statement that cooperative business is more efficient than non-cooperative business because of lower cost of merchandise, lower operation costs and lower costs of finance. The book is divided into five parts which indi cate the scope of the work. 1. The Historical Background. 2. The structure of the Cooperative Movement.<query> why is cooperative retail more efficient than non cooperative retail</query> 3. Cooperative Democracy. 4. Prob lems of Cooperative Enterprise. 5. The Social significance of Cooperative enterprise. The last section on the social aspects of coop- 63 ""i I .1 eration is a ringing challenge to democracy-loving Americans. As the authors point out, ""It is a commonplace remark that democracy is on trial. Current discussion centers upon political democ racy and it is generally said, even by advocates of democracy, that it does not work, or has not yet been made to work, in the economic sphere. It is strange that in the course of all this discus sion, little or no attention 'has been paid to tlie consumers' cooperative movement. Here is a suc cessful economic enterprise, of long standing and in the course of steady expansion, which is com pletely democratic, not only in form but also in fact."" American economists and business men and any one truly interested in the preservation of the American way should accept the challenge.<query> what is cooperative democracy</query> This book should go a lon var censorship to face as does Kagawa. The Two Crutches— Spending and Lending Our old creaky system of monopolistic economics is once more in dire need of outside assistance. It cannot carry on by itself. So it indirectly calls upon the gov ernment again for help (while all the time shouting, ""keep the government out of business""). And the government is again responding with another pair of new crutches of spending and lending. No other way can be found to carry on with out getting too near the danger line of revolution. Since business cannot distribute enough purchasing power to the many, but instead piles up profits in the hands of the few, the government is called upon to spend money for doles and public em ployment. This would not be as bad if the administration had nerve enough to tax away from the few the amount it dis tributes to the many, instead of continu ing to borrow.<query> what is the crutches of spending and lending</query> Since.the banks cannot lend enough money to business to in crease production, even though their Consumers' Cooperation *n organ to spread the knowledge of the Consumers' Cooperative Movement, whereby the people, in voluntary association, purchase and produce for their own use the things they need.

It should be added, to complete tlie statements of the Webbs, that they ad vocate the reorganization of government functions to separate economic from political matters. In other words, they urge that such ""obligatory"" economic services as water, electricity, communi cation, transportation, etc. should be or ganized separately from the political functions of protection, justice, taxation, etc., and that we should vote as con sumers for those whom we desire to di rect our public economic services sepa rately from voting as citizens for those whom we desire to direct our political affairs. A similar general proposal is also advocated by Toyohiko Kagawa with a descriptive chart of such a suggested governmental reorganization in his book ""Brotherhood Economics."" The Primacy of the Consumer in an Age of Plenty It is becoming clearer that our eco nomic system is organized on the wrong base to meet our present problems.<query> what is the primary function of the consumer</query> Yet 23% of the RFC's present industrial loans are now in de fault. It is a case of keeping the dying system alive while we build a new cooperative economic society. Ownership For All! Harry Hopkins, WPA Administrator, calls for ""Jobs for All"" through public or ganization to supplement private industry and agriculture. Others are calling for ""Incomes for All"" through social insur ances in the -form of old-age, health and unemployment insurances. What is really needed is ""Ownership for All."" Everything else is only tem porizing and putting plasters on the can cer that is eating at our vitals. We, the people, of America have largely lost the ownership of the land we live in. The best statistical estimates say that 80% of the wealth is now owned by only 2% of the people.<query> who is harry hopkins</query> A Senate investigation showed that 59% was owned by 1 % a few years ago. When only 2% own 80% and 98% own only 20% of the wealth there is no possibility of economic liberty and equality through the patching up by the government of a broken down pri vate-profit system that will not itself dis tribute incomes, jobs and ownership to all. What is needed is a major operation —that's what a program of Consumers', Producers' and Public Cooperation is— the combination of these will eventually redistribute ownership to all, which is the basic necessity if incomes are to be distributed to all and jobs are to be distributed to every employable.

But apparently we are not yet ""intelli gent."" However, cooperators are be coming so.<query> who said the stock exchange is a perfect institution</query> The 20th Year of OTK of Finland While we use abbreviations in Amer ica for convenience in describing our many governmental agencies, it is pretty nearly necessary to speak of the national wholesale and educational groups in Fin land in alphabetical terms because of the difficulties of pronunciation. OTK is the abbreviation for the name Osuustukku- kauppa, one of the two largest whole sales in Finland, which has just ended its twentieth year of activity.

THREE DEPRESSIONS AND THEIR LESSONS \\7E are in the early stages of the W third great depression since the war. That this is no recession but a gen uine depression can be seen by comparing statistics with 1929. Here are compari sons of the first six months declines fol lowing the 1929 and 1937 depressions: 1929 Decline 1937 Decline National income 6% 11% Manufacturing activity 15% 35% Factory employment 10% 20% Factory payrolls 12% 30% The first depression, starting in 1920, followed eight years of Democratic New Freedom. The second depression, start ling in 1929, came at the end of twelve years of Republican New Day.<query> when did the third great depression start</query> The present depression, starting in 1937, comes during the closing period of eight years of Democratic New Deal. Plainly, changing political administrations and slogans has not solved our economic downs and ups. The 1920 depression followed an in flation of commodity prices. The 1929 de pression followed an inflation of stock prices. The 1937 depression followed an inflation of both commodity and stock prices. All three depressions were pre ceded by increasing profit-piling in the hands of the few and were followed by increasing poverty, unemployment and. tenancy among the many. The primary lesson to learn is that the government cannot stop depressions.. This statement is .predicated on the pre sumption that America continues a demo cratic government. Conceivably a dicta torship might do so by the fixing of prices and allocating of production, but a demo cratic government cannot do these things, and remain a democracy.<query> what was the main lesson of the depression</query> The government can do some things. It can cushion the shocks by social insur ances. It can establish national minimums of wages, leisure, housing, education, health. It can expand publicly-owned utility yardsticks and thus lower rates, instead of continuing futile attempts at political regulation of private-profit monopolies. But again we say that a dem- INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY 1920 DEPRESSION 1929 DEPRESSION 1937 DEPRESSION 1920 1921 1929 1930 1931 1932 1937 1938 1939 Consumers' Cooperation May, 1938 ocratic government cannot stop depres sions. Only the people, acting voluntarily as consumers and producers, can end de pressions for all time. They can do so as consumers by building Consumers' Coop eratives and Credit Unions. They can do so as producers by building Labor Unions and Farm Marketing Cooperatives. Only by building these types of non-profit, democratically controlled, peoples' own ed economic organizations of consumers and producers can we prevent a recur rence of other depressions which, unless .stopped, will eventually result in either a dictatorship of the right or left.<query> what kind of government can stop the depression</query> Voluntary Cooperatives are the democratic answer to depressions. pa ers learned to organize Consumers' r°~ operatives after 1920.

It is not a system alien to the spirit of America, but the natural economic expression of liberty and equality. It is the economic realiza tion of the ""American Dream."" It extends the same principles which our forefathers applied to the organization of religion, education and government into the eco nomic field as well.<query> what is voluntary cooperatives</query> Economics must 'be come democratic if democracy is to be fully realized, indeed if our present forms of democratic organization are to be pre served. From Evangelization to Organization This fact is now being rapidly ac cepted by the leaders and members of America's great democratic organiza tions. They are now including Con sumers' Cooperation as an integral part of their own programs. We have passed the evangelization stage and are entering into the education and organization stage. It is a highly significant thing that within the past few months the other great democratic organizations have them selves organized committees of their leaders to carry on programs of educa tion and organization of Consumers' Co operatives among their own members. What is happening justifies repeating and resummarizing. 1. In the religious world, out of which inspiration toward the building of a new 68 world of brotherhood is presumed to gen erate, both the Federal Council of Churches and the National Catholic Ru ral Life Conference have appointed ac tive committees on the Church and Con sumers' Cooperation. 2.<query> what is the importance of evangelization to organization</query> In the educational world, which has for its responsibility the teaching of facts about every form of democratic develop ment, the National Education Associa tion has also appointed a Committee to study the question of the teaching of Co operation in the public schools of Amer ica. This follows action taken in a legis lative way in three states. It might well be added that France has had an ag gressive program of teaching cooperation in their public schools, both by book study and by practice, for the past ten years, which has resulted in the organiza tion of over ten thousand children's co operatives which receive a special pub lication, ""Copain-Coop"". A film showing the cooperative activities of the children in the schools of France won the Grand Prize at the Paris Exposition. Likewise among adult education groups, the subject of Consumers' Coop eration is being increasingly chosen as an integral part of their programs of forums and class study.<query> what is the cooperative program in france</query> Ori ginally, Dr. Horace M. Kallen argues in his ""Decline and Rise of the Consumer,"" mankind organized its economic services primarily on a consumer basis. Later the producers became dominant over the consumers. He argues for a reorganiza tion of our economic life on a consumer foundation. ""We are born consumers and become producers,"" says Dr. Kallen; ""We are consumers by nature and pro ducers by necessity."" Professor Leroy E.

The Ohio Valley Adult Educa tion Conference, which is a branch of the American Association of Adult Educa- Consumers' Cooperation . lia^ a special section on Consumer Education in its recent conference at pïts'burgh. The Forums conducted by the II S. Department of Education in many •ties have included Cooperation as one Cf the subjects. When labor develops a thorough Workers' Education program, s has been done in European countries, the study of Consumers' Cooperation will L£ expanded on a wide scale. The Fo- uiiis conducted by the AAA also have a section devoted to Cooperative Pur chasing. 3 In the political field, Consumers' Co operation is being increasingly recognized as a part of an all-around democratic eco nomic program.<query> what is the subject of consumer cooperation</query> President Roosevelt's appointment of a Commitee to study the subject in Europe was unusual recogni tion on the part of the administration. Four governors have publicly endorsed Consumers' Cooperation, and in the State of Minnesota a special committee has now been appointed to survey Coopera tives. 4. In the peace organization field, there is a growing tendency toward the accept ance of the necessity of a fundamental reorganization of the economic system on a non-profit, democratically controlled basis as the final foundation of world peace. The National Peace Council has recently included the subject of consumer economics as an officially adopted part of its program following the recom mendation of its Committee of Experts. But while church groups may inspire their members to act as consumers, edu cational groups may inform youth and adults about the subject, political groups may promote the movement, peace groups may include cooperation in their programs, this is all only the means of publicizing and educating to the end of organizing Consumers' Cooperatives.<query> what is the importance of consumer cooperatives</query> 5. In the farm field, the organizing of Consumers' Cooperative Purchasing As sociations is going on in dead earnest. As the members of rural purchasing groups increasingly recognize the integral rela tionship which they have with urban residents, in building a great Consumers' Cooperative Purchasing Movement, the progress is accelerated by their entrance into the field of household goods and joining hands with their urban cousins in a united effort. Way, 1938 6. The office workers of America are now following the trail which the farmers of America have blazed. Several hundred stores and oil stations have either already developed into full-fledged cooperatives or are on the way as buying clubs or study circles, whose membership has been largely recruited from the ranks of office workers. 7. In the labor field now rests the final great necessity for action for all the great democratic organizations of America to join hands in developing the economics of democracy.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative purchasing</query> A few Consumers' Coop eratives have been organized which have been initiated by labor. Consumers' Co operation has been endorsed by A. F. of L. conventions and by the conventions of some of the C.I.O. unions. All this is now leading to the setting up of Cooper ative and Labor Conferences such as the one held in April under the joint spon sorship of the Eastern Cooperative League and Wholesale and Cooperative Distributors. An initial attempt two years ego only brought out a corporal's guard, while this recent conference was attended •by representatives of over twenty unions. Similar conferences should now be held elsewhere and cooperative committees of labor groups should be appointed to car ry on a publicizing, education and or ganizing program all over America. Build Economic Democracy in America We are still able in America to choose the ""Middle Way."" But how long there will be time to do so if we do not organize more rapidly along democratic economic lines, is uncertain.<query> what is the purpose of the cooperative labor conference</query> While Cooperation will eventually triumph everywhere in the world, for it is truth itself, the prob lem for us in America is as to whether we will delay too long and permit the forces of Fascism or Communism to regi ment us for years and eventually have to be overthrown, before we can and will, as a nation, aggressively build here in our section of the world, an economic as well as a political democracy. There is real hope in the fact that the democratic organizations which America has already developed are increasingly adopting Consumers' Cooperation as an integral part of their own programs. 69 COOPERATIVE EDUCATION IN SWEDEN ~Y\7HEN we look for models of social * » achievement these days, we are apt to turn to Scandinavia. All of the dis cussion about the achievements there would have greater point if they stressed more the preparation for these achieve ments, the patient work of a generation or more, in popular education.<query> what is the role of cooperation in the democratic organization</query> Mr. Anders Hedberg on his recent ""visit here was asked, in a radio dis cussion, whether the pinch of poverty ""was the prime motive for substantial co operative development. His reply was that he did not think so because in Eu rope there were several countries in ""which poverty was much more acute than in modern Sweden but where coop eration was not extensive. ""Cooperative development,"" he said, ""is a measure of the level of economic education of the masses of the people."" And so it is in Sweden. The half mil lion and more families which, through their cooperative purchasing, control the price level of Sweden, are not motivated primarily by poverty. They protect their consumer interests through cooperatives because they know what their interests are and how better to serve them. This same knowledge leads them into labor unions and farm marketing cooperatives to conserve their producer interests, and >.t directs their political support to liberal governments which employ, in the in terests of all of the people, that power test wielded by governments.<query> why is cooperative development important</query> Correspondence School In achieving this high level of popular education, the organizations which have been promoting constructive social action in these fields have all been active as educative forces. Conspicuous among them is the work of the central coopera tive organization which, in addition to ~being Sweden's principal publisher of economic literature, is also conducting a correspondence school, a resident college and a department for stimulating and guiding what they call study-circles. It is our intention to consider briefly the na ture and extent of these undertakings. It is significant to note that the educa- 70 tional functions of 'Kooperativa p bundet, the Cooperative Union arid Wholesale, are much broader in SCOD than would normally be regarded needed for cooperative enterprises alon^ For instance, the publishing department issues not only cooperative literature, but general economic literature with con tributions from Sweden's leading econ omists.<query> what is the purpose of a correspondence school</query> They publish a weekly maqa- zine, ""Vi"" (We) in which relatively small space goes to cooperative subjects And so with the correspondence courses Established in 1918 as the first na tionally organized cooperative educa tional program, the correspondence! school now devotes only a share of its energy to cooperative training. Courses in public speaking, Swedish language, government and many others occupy an important place in the program of the school. All of the correspondence courses are available to any who apply. Since its inception it has enrolled well over 150,- 000 students at an increasing rate. In the year 1936-1937, over 30,000 persons were enrolled, exclusive of those partic ipating in the study circles to be men tioned later. With the enrollments on the increase and running at 20,000 new stu dents per year at the present time, it can readily be seen that in the period of a generation these courses will reach a very substantial proportion of the Swedish people.<query> when was correspondence school established</query> The courses cover the range of subjects covered in the seconda ry schools and are highly regarded by the educational leaders of the country. In the cooperative field the corres pondence courses have two functions: ( 1 ) the supplying of courses in economic principles, including cooperative prin ciples, as a part of the general economic training from which the cooperatives naturally derive benefit in the form of popular economic enlightenment and ac cessions to their membership and (2) the technical vocational training of employ ees and store managers. In the latter function they relate to the work of the cooperative college in an in teresting way. When a young man or woman gets a job with a cooperative so- . ty usually as a grocery clerk, his CLe0r'etical training begins with a corres- jence course, which gives him coop- P jjve principles along with the elements 6f grocery store operation.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative training</query> When this ""curse is completed, but not until then, [here is a course available at the college, Var Gard, and so with all of the coop- rative training of both employees and «embers of committees and boards of directors. Correspondence courses are followed by short residence courses at the college. The theory seems to be that those things best learned from books can be learned more efficiently and at less cost through a correspondence course. Those things best learned in schools with direct supervision of a teacher are taught at the college. Cooperative College Since the correspondence courses em phasize book learning, the college em phasizes those things which cannot be learned from books. Consequently, few books are found in use at the college—a rather unique condition for a college. In discussing their educational pro- pram, the Swedish cooperatives speak of three kinds of schools: ( 1 ) The Corres pondence Schools—learning from books; (2) The Study Circles—learning from books and discussion and (3) Experience.<query> what is the difference between a correspondence course and a college course</query> They are discovering that it is possible through the Cooperatives to balance the budget, to prevent the cities from continually draining the country."" The chapter on the Cooperative Movement is very strong. Dawber challenges the rural leader ship and especially the church to ""take seriously the question of its responsibility to the masses of under-privileged people and develop some pro- qram of social action through the Cooperatives."" In fact, the whole book is built around this theme. The author does speak of religious education, of church buildings, of the need of an educated ministry, and these chapters may not be so defi nitely cooperative in tone. But yet, it is education for life, for social action, he is wishing. It is the church, the centre and dynamic forces in the com munity, as it is in Nova Scotia, he would have developed.<query> what is the cooperative movement</query> Each individual has two economic in terests—his producer interests and his consumer interests. There are two producer interests—the sale of products or services. In some cases producers sell their services direct ly, in other cases they sell their services through the products which they indi vidually produce. Generally farmers and 'fishermen and some other primary pro ducers sell the products of their labor, rather than their labor. On the other hand, factory and office workers and pro fessional people generally sell their serv ices directly. To sell their products farm ers organize marketing cooperatives; workers organize labor unions and pro fessionals organize associations to sell their services. Consumer interests are the purchase of two forms of goods — household goods and vocational goods. Household goods include food, clothing, furniture, sh It etc. Vocational goods include farm plies, workers' tools, and professiSUPi equipment.<query> what is the difference between producer and consumer interests</query> The Cooperative College falls in group (3), the school of experience, because they regard it as a sort of selected or directed experience rather than a book learning institution. Insofar as possible, the conditions of a cooperative business are reproduced at the school. There is a model cooperative store with one wall removed and the classroom seats facing the store as the ordinary schoolroom faces the blackboard. The fine points of serving customers, weighing, wrapping, etc., are all analyzed in practice under normal conditions. Instruction is given with the aim of developing taste and dis crimination in such matters as design in dishes and fabrics. Many demonstration exhibits are on hand to give knowledge °f the processes involved in manufactur- lng various store items. Visits are ar ranged under close direction to the Luma krnp factory and other cooperative man ufacturing plants and reports and dis- eussions of observations are had after these visits.<query> what is cooperative college</query> Consumers' Cooperation May, 1938 The emphasis of all of this is on prac tical problems and their solution. Lec tures are avoided as are written essays and other standard methods of formal schools. Study is largely by group dis cussion and group projects. During this training the employees draw their regular salaries and their attitudes and relation ship are more like those of people at work rather than students at school. Three standard courses comprise the bulk of Var Card's curriculum: (1) One- week courses for store salesmen; (2) a Branch Manager's course of one month and (3) a course for Society Managers and others in responsible positions, also one month. Each course has its prere quisite correspondence courses which must be completed satisfactorily before admission to Var Gard. Many other courses involving smaller numbers of people are held thru the year, such as courses for specific jobs in the factories and stores and courses for directors of societies, group leaders, leaders of women's guilds and leaders of youth groups.<query> what is the curriculum for var card</query> From the students in the third of the regular courses are selected a few who take a two-year course for staff spe cialists' positions (such as educational directors) in the larger societies. In the course of their two years they not only have thorough training in all of the basic Var Gard courses, but they have the opportunity to teach some of the courses. A principal, a former folk school head, and four assistants who are technical men in various fields, comprise the regu lar staff. The annual cost, about $30,000, is met from the funds of Kooperativa Forbundet, the central society. Cooperative Study^Circles Unique as are the correspondence school and the cooperative college as in struments of cooperative education, per haps the most far-reaching element of the cooperative education program is the study-circle.<query> how much does var garde cost</query> The possibilities of such study as an educational process for the masses of the people, give promise of continuing the present trend in Sweden to a higher level of economic literacy among the people at large. The study-circle, however, is not the invention of the Cooperatives. It has a 71 I long history in Swedish popular educa tion and a well-developed educational theory which the cooperatives have taken over rather recently and adopted to their needs. The study circle had its inception in a cause quite remote from cooperation, the Order of Good Templars. Under the guidance of Dr. Oscar Olsson, the study- circle technique was evolved as a means of educating people to be temperate in their use of liquors. The present Swedish liquor control systems must lay part of their success to the long process of edu cation in this field by the study-circles.<query> what is the study circle</query> Fortunately, the temperament of Oscar Olsson was such that he was not content to have developed a method of temper ance education only. Through the years he has expanded the philosophy at home and abroad so that the Swedish study- circle movement has become a subject of world consideration as an indispensable method of adult .education of all sorts. In Sweden study-circles are now a part of the basic program of education in poli tics, labor, religious, cooperation and other mass movements. Strange as it may seem, the study- circle movement in Sweden is, in its es sentials, a movement for education and not for propaganda. Oscar Olsson has preached for many years that ""the devel opment of society does not suffer by dif ferent opinions about society among citi zens, if society only sees to it that citi zens are educated conservatives and edu cated socialists."" So the study-circle movement has induced a progressive government to give money to any genu ine educational organization, regardless of the complexion of its economic or so cial philosophy.<query> what is the study circle movement</query> As an outgrowth of this policy, there are in Sweden many workers' educational associations in which, social-democrats, syndicalists, communists and cooperators have formed a common educational front. Local government bodies support these programs, insisting only that lecturers be competent authorities and teach prin ciples rather than propaganda. Specifically within the Cooperative Movement, study-circles are encouraged by Kooperativa Forbundet which main tains a staff for this purpose, supplies literature and study outlines, reviews and comments on answers to questions 72 worked out by the study-circles and n k lishes a magazine for the study-cir ] groups. In practice, these small qroui,e generally meet without a teacher | though one among them is usually Se lected by the group as the leader. Th purchase study-guides and literature f^ the course the group undertakes to stn,/ for from 25 to 50 cents.<query> what is cooperative movement</query> The follow^ are some of the courses available: ""Ç operation,"" ""Cooperation and the Eco- nomic Life of the Nation,"" ""Cooperation and Prices,"" ""The Problem of Monono lies,"" ""Cooperation and Agriculture "" ""Housing,"" ""Food,"" ""Health"" and many others. Usually one or more complete books, supplemented by pamphlets, are used as the basis of the course. Each chapter of the study guide which serves as the basis for one meeting of the group is concluded by three so-called ""capital questions"" which are answered by the group. These are sent to Kooperativa Fortmndet, studied and returned with comments. When the Fall program of study started in September, 1937, there were 10,070 study circles with 62,200 in dividual students. In an interview with Dr. Olsson he credited the study-circle department of the Cooperative Movement in Sweden with having perfected his original idea.<query> when was the study circle program of study started</query> He summed up his early thinking by say ing that he conceived that a small group of adults who would voluntarily meet regularly, who would democratically select a discussion leader from among their own group, and who would read and discuss a great book together would eventually get at the heart of the book. He now feels, he said, that he had too much faith in the ability of such groups to do alone all he conceived. The coop erative movement, he stated, had added two valuable additional methods, first, the supplying of a discussion group guide to help open up the thinking of the author of the book and, second, the provision for group replies to major ques tions, which are reviewed and com mented upon by the central staff. This, briefly, recounts the study-circle program of the cooperatives.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> In the field of labor and progressive politics similar programs are under way with like in tensity. All of which stem from the philosophy originally propounded by L>r- Olsson. Consumers' Cooperation These programs are not adult educa- f0n in the sense often assumed in the United States. They do not deal with cul ture in a certain innocuous sense as sug- ested by the title ""The Butterflies of Sumatra,"" one announced under the heading of Adult Education. The study- circle technique is one designed for the large masses of mankind who need a wider and firmer grasp of reality, and understanding of the forces that control their destinies. The study-circle, in a word, is an in strument of orderly social change, as suming the premise that a non-violent process of evolution leads to a better so ciety. All former civilizations, says Dr. Olsson, have been defeated because they were created and supported by a very small part of educated society, dependent for this work upon the fact that the masses of the people were serfs with such small material and spiritual demands that they would never grasp the highest values of human culture, or be conscious of having any part in them.<query> what is the study circle technique</query> Therefore the strongholds, both from within and from without, broke down when the hour of trial came. ""The world catastrophe and education now have their race for life,"" to quote Wells. Progress Not Panaceas There is some tendency to discount the SMALL TOWN CO-OP 'R town is small, conservative and comfortable—for those who find it so. Any troubling of the status quo is looked upon as dangerous, if not sub versive. The ""outsiders,"" consisting of school-teachers, artists, writers and some farmers, formed the nucleus of our coop erative in the beginning. We started or dering by mail from Cooperative Dis tributors in New York and thus came to realize that we need not take it sitting down from the chain stores or the few local merchants who were socially very Pleasant but expensive.

By organizing farm cooperatives, labor unions and professional associations the producers of Sweden increase the pay they get; by organizing consumers' co operatives and public utilities the con sumers of Sweden reduce the prices they are charged. Thus they distribute pur chasing power widely among the people The Relation o£ Organized Farm Producers and Consumers in Sweden After organizing into voluntary groups the producers and consumers of Sweden have formulated the beginnings of a co operative economic constitution. They have entered into an agreement between the producers and consumers of farm products in which the pay to producers and the price to consumers is determined by a coordinating board representing the two groups, with no private monopoly- middleman or any government authority between them.<query> what is the relationship between producers and consumers in sweden</query> We are told that their prosperity is dependent upon armament manufacture and a cor ner on certain natural resouces, that their cooperatives spring from racial homo- genity, that their culture springs from antiquity. All of this would be cogent if other nations equally favored enjoyed as desirable a status. The important thing about the Swedes is not how much they have achieved relatively, but it is the fact that they are making some measurable progress while much of the rest of the world is losing ground. There is no Utopia there, and it may well be that they too will be swallowed up in the catastrophic fall which the prophets of doom and disaster hold be fore us. Be all that as it may, there are enduring evidences of those things which ""rust doth not corrupt nor thieves break through and steal."" Tihere is something about the Swedish methods of adult edu cation which breeds a desire for a greater diffusion of the better things of life, ma terial and spiritual, which has a different ring from that which usually passes for adult education.<query> what is the importance of the swedish people</query> While there is yet time, perhaps we too may reinforce our democ racy and extend the benefits of a ma terially abundant age at the same time by following their example. Henry Chapin from the Eastern Cooperative Whole sale. We came to the pleasant conclusion that our chain-store budgets, placed else where, could bring a quality and stand ard into our living not obtainable on Main Street. Eighteen months ago we formed a club of about twenty members. We read a few excellent pamphlets, held discussions and listened to exciting lecturers. We visited a few successful co operatives, among them the one at May- nard, Massachusetts. Then, like good Americans, we said: Let's go. Let's fix it. Bosoms began to heave, minds to crackle. Forty strong, we decided to go into action. 73 Collective Bargaining with Private Dealers In February, 1937, we made collective bargaining arrangements for discounts on laundry, gasoline, coal and fuel oil.<query> when did the eastern co operative start</query> We also carefully worked out an ar rangement with the only remaining inde pendent grocer in town to carry coop erative goods on his shelves under the club's control. We raised $300 as a re volving fund for this project. Inside of three months we were forced to cancel all but the group purchase of coal and oil; the laundry service because of poor quali ty and the gasoline service because other stations cut prices and thus wiped out the small profit our dealer could make above the club discount. The grocery store ar rangement failed for more complicated reasons. There had formerly been three inde pendent grocery stores in this town of about three thousand people. One had been closed out as a failure several years before we organized: a second one had gone bankrupt a few months before we started, and the third man seemed in terested to work on certain terms with us.<query> why did the grocery store ar rangement fail</query> We hoped to win him over to the coop erative idea and in time make his store a completely cooperative one. On his part, he looked upon us with favor as a group which could increase his business, but he was somewhat sceptical of our ultimate success. He thought of us as inexperi enced idealists but was willing to ex periment. We purchased and put $300 worth of cooperatively labelled goods on his shelves and kept books on the sales and made every effort for our membership to use his store for all their purchases, of which our own goods were only a por tion. On the purchase of the store-keep er's goods the club got 4% discount; on our own goods the store-keeper took a flat 15% margin of profit for selling and shelving-space. It was agreed that, as his sales increased, he should bring his prices down to chain store levels.<query> what was the cooperative idea</query> What happened was this. The cooper ative shelves, for the most part, held goods at chain store price levels which were superior in quality to the general run of nationally advertised products stocked by the store-keeper, and, as he did not reduce his prices our membership 74 tended to buy this last type of tnercha dise from the chain stores, of which th were two dominating the grocery ku^ ness of the town. Two courses were ope'"" to the store-keeper; to expand as a 00° operative store at lower prices, or, bein afraid of that, to push his own goods and give half-hearted service to the coopera tive shelves. He chose the latter cours and at the end of three months our agree ment with him was mutually terminated The town fathers and merchants had meanwhile done what they could on the quiet to warn the store-keeper against the dangerous character of the coopera tive movement.<query> what happened to the cooperative shelves</query> They hinted darkly that it was communistic and un-American Start a Store—Learn a Lot May first, 1937, we rented for one year the site of a previously bankrupt store, at $25 a month, and opened up with about $800 worth of goods, largely from the Eastern Cooperative Wholesale of New York. Our membership was now about seventy-five. Immediately we were out of soundings and our headaches be gan in earnest. We were too few to start a store and were practically without guidance whether from our own mem bership or any available outside agency. Unfortunately, the premature collapse of our previous arrangement left us holding the bag and we did not wish to retreat. A member of our club with previous cooperative experience, but no store training, offered himself as store-keeper at $15 a week.<query> when did the eastern cooperative wholesale start</query> The first month we very nearly broke even on expenses. The sec ond month we took a slight loss due to purchasing equipment and five dollars a week added to salary. July was not so good and August definitely bad. Some became disheartened and broached the question of possibly closing the store be- ifore it was too late. Our store-keeper, in a way, had been made the willing goat of our too much haste in starting the store. He also be came discouraged because, not finding a complete stock of goods, members began to slip off and purchase elsewhere, while the local non-members held off to sej; the enterprise was not merely a fad. The store-keeper, likewise, suffered from his own unavoidable lack of specific business training and from the club's want of ex perience in business affairs.<query> why was the storekeeper discouraged</query> The book- eping alone caused imminent nervous w118 among the valiant who had ]unteered to shoulder the burden. Experienced Manager — Over the Top Last September we took the bull by the horns, increased our stock and hired a trained store-manager at $25 a week. At (he same time we recast our constitution and by-laws and applied for incorpora- Uon. In other words we became more business-like. Our sales increased. In October we made a small profit; in No vember we had almost doubled our sales from those of August and on the first of January, 1938, we showed an actual small net profit above all expenses and deficits incurred during the initial months of establishing our store. We are out of the woods. Our bookkeeping is organ ized, our membership has increased be yond a hundred and at last we are be ginning to function efficiently.<query> how much does a store manager make</query> Without steady and sometimes heart breaking work by ten or fifteen members we should not have pulled through on the store. Looking back I feel this risk and strain are, in part, unnecessary and cer tainly a handicap we could have avoided by a less precipitate entrance into the highly competitive and technical field of store-keeping. And yet, a store such as ours is the best concrete demonstration in a community that the cooperative movement is practical and possible even against stiff chain store competition. Experiences Others Can Profit By Going back over this brief history let me first recapitulate our mistakes and the difficulties, both human and material, that cannot always be avoided in such an un- oertaiking. Cooperative work requires mudh patience, real humbling of personal ambition and the willingness of an indi vidual to compromise with others whose wisdom he feels is less profound than his j>wn.<query> what is cooperative work</query> Contention is often more fun and lfss boring than adjustment. When a group swings from pamphlets into action fte variety of temperament in a small 9roup of like minded people is surprising. furthermore, a club will be lucky in a small community, if it runs into nothing m°re than passive resistance from those Consumers' Cooperation jj^ ^ outside. Tactful and constant education is essential. With us we found that the public school hall and the church as sembly rooms were not available for meetings. We either had to hire a hall which was too large and expensive or crowd into a private house for our lec tures and discussions. At present we are forced to meet in the store. Only con crete obstruction should be directly at tacked. Gossip and inattention can best be overcome by the testimony of accom plishment and an interesting educational program.<query> why is constant education necessary</query> There is no toll of either profits or interest taken from the pro ducers or consumers, . The chart illus trates the working out of the agreement into which they have entered in the case of some of their farm products. RELATION OF FARMERS AND CONSUMERS FARM PRODUCERS MEAT: 1 l COORDINATING BOARD CONSUMERS COLLECT There is no good reason why the fields f farm producers and consumers' organ- tions cannot be definitely determined If3 joint agreement between the repre- ntatives °f ^e two organized groups. F orn time to time it is probable that cer- •n shifts o'f functions will be found ad- ^isable between the work which organ- • ec| farm producers and organized con- 'timers should perform. The joint board can agree upon such changes from time to time as are in the interests of justice and efficiency. What is needed in the United States is that a more rapid ad vance be made towards the formation of such a cooperative economic constitution as has been done in Sweden.<query> what is the relationship between producers and consumers</query> This brings up the apparent conflict between education and works. Discus sion and propaganda alone will not in crease the membership beyond a certain point. On the other hand, no responsible business undertaking should be started without a homogeneous and fairly good sized group behind it. Local conditions alone can dictate the best time for the inevitable jump from preaching to prac tice. Over-enthusiasm among the mem bership can be as dangerous as bore dom and apathy. In a small town, it is safe to generalize, a store should not be opened without a hundred families to support it and an initial capital of about $1500. Careful organization from the first is essential. As early as possible adopt a definite constitution and by-laws ad justed to local conditions which specif ically detail the functions of government and the limits of all working committees.<query> what is the minimum capital needed to open a small business</query> Next outline the needs and limitations of finance. Particularly in relation to future savings returns, define whether separate collective bargaining contracts, such as fuel oil and coal, shall return separate savings or whether all enterprises shall be judged as one and savings voted to members from a common surplus, if and when it exists. For a small club a com mon savings return on all enterprises is preferable. After all, a cooperative is not just a discount seeking group. It is organ ized for group service and all members should be willing to stand and fall to gether. Furthermore, be slow in making savings returns to the membership in cash. It is pleasant and will aid recruiting, but in the beginning the important thing is to build a solid organization and keep clear of debt.

This all sounds very platitudinous, but the flesh is weak and cooperatives are maintained by a membership which on the whole can only give part time to club affairs.

COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH Columbus, Ohio—The Farm Bureau Automobile Insurance Company, Amer ica's largest auto insurance cooperative, jumped from seventh to fifth place among the mutual automobile insurance com panies of the nation at the close of 1937.<query> what is cooperative business</query> The rating is based on premiums written. Premium income if or 1937 was $4,353,- 929, an increase of more than a million dollars over 1936. New York—The Workmen's Mutual Fire Insurance Society, one of the oldest cooperative associations in the United States, reported at its annual meeting here in April that it is now handling furniture fire insurance for 68,295 mem bers in 11 states. Outstanding insurance in force at the end of 1937 totaled $87,071,920, an in crease of $1,132,175 for the year. The co-op was granted a license to operate in Connecticut and Minnesota and 2,612 new members were enrolled during the year. Superior, Wisconsin—Central Coop erative Wholesale voted at its annual meeting here April 11 and 12 to place $18,000 of its $76,000 earnings in re serves and pay out $25,000 of its patron age refunds in the fall of 1938 and the remaining $33,500 in the fall of 1940.<query> what is the average annual income of a co-op</query> With its financial position thus strength ened, the co-op moved to take advantage of the increased interest in consumer co operatives engendered by the depression by increasing the budget for the educa tional department from $7,800 in 1937 to $12,000 for the current year. 76 The delegates instructed the educa tional department to spread information about cooperative medicine with the ulti mate purpose of establishing cooperative health associations in the territory served by the co-op wholesale; authorized the board to establish a branch warehouse to serve member cooperatives in the Up per Michigan Peninsula; and recom mended that the board consider the feasibility of installing a system of gov ernment supervised grade labeling. Minneapolis—In the face of the busi ness ""recession"" tank car shipments of petroleum products by Midland Cooper ative Wholesale during the first three months of 1938 were almost 50 per cent greater than during the same period in 1937.<query> what was the purpose of the midland co-op</query> Shipments in March set a new all time high of 709 cars, but the manage ment explained that part of that increase was due to advance orders to escape freight rate increases which went into effect March 28. Total shipments to affiliated co-ops for the first quarter were 1,435 cars as com pared with 957 for the first quarter last year. Walla Walla, Washington — Pacific Supply Cooperative has just purchased a warehouse building here which will DC remodeled to serve as headquarters tor the co-op wholesale and distributing cen ter for the seventy retail cooperativesi ar filiated with Pacific Supply in the three Northwestern states. iBecause of rapidly growing busines the co-op wholesale has also acquire"" Consumers' Cooperation wholesale facilities in Portland, Oregon, pd Caldwell, Idaho.

Sassaman, secretary of the State Planning Board; and Leo Knute of the State Department of Education. The new planning board will make a survey of Minnesota co-ops and sponsor the formation of county cooperative councils or regional federations, built from the bottom up by representatives of local cooperatives, to strengthen cooper ative education and organization. Washington, D. C.—Forty-two burial cooperatives with an estimated member ship of 27,000 are now in operation in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota, the Bureau of Labor Sta tistics reported this month.<query> who is the director of the cooperative planning board</query> The average cost per funeral in the co-ops is $175 as compared with an average price of $335 for the same type of burial service in private profit under taking establishments. Cooperative burial associations have been so successful that the private profit undertakers association in Minnesota sought to prevent the further organiza tion of co-ops by bringing suit contending that a burial co-op is not legal under the state law because it does not serve the ultimate consumer."" After a long contro versy the case was decided in favor of the cooperatives. Chicago—The evolution of a city co- °P from a grocery store to a service organization covering many fields was Jlustrated last montär wlhen the North Shore Cooperative Society opened the 'jrst consumer-owned flas and oil sta- (l°n in the city limits of Chicago. The May, 1938 co-op started a grocery store three years ago.<query> average cost of a funeral in a co-op</query> It is now also operating two milk routes, a butcher shop, fruit and vege table service, a credit union and a gas oline station. The opening of the first gas and oil co-op in Chicago may mark an important step in the organization of city gas sta tions which may some day match the record of rural co-ops which are handling in the neighborhood of $60,000,000 worth of petroleum products a year. Amarillo, Texas—'Local retail cooper atives in nine midwestern states returned to their members $850,000 in savings re funds during 1937, according to Howard A. Cowden, president of Consumers Co operative Association in an address to the annual meeting of Consumers Coop eratives Associated here last month. ""That money was left in the communi ties where it was earned,"" Mr. Cowden declared. ""If the co-op members were to spend all of those savings for shoes they would buy 212,000 pairs at $4 a pair; that would have kept 700 people at work for a year or enough workers to represent a town of 3,500 people."" Maynard, 'Mass.—The United Coop erative Society of Maynard, now well established as the largest retail business in this town o;f 7,000- inhabitants, recorded the biggest business'in its history when its total sales for 1937 mounted to more than half a million dollars.<query> when was the first gas co-op established</query> Sales totaled $509,190 in 1937 as against $475,931 during the previous year. Net earnings for the year were $20,598 of which approximately $17,000 were paid out in 3J^% savings returns. All customers of the co-op, members and non-members alike, participated in the patronage dividends. New York—Three years ago the of ficers of the Knickerbocker Village co operative buying club took turns getting up at four o'clock in the morning to de liver cooperative milk to members of the struggling little co-op. Nursed on co-op milk, the cooperative took on the distribution of tree-ripened oranges and grapefruit when it had grown to 35 members. In 1936 the co-op arranged for the use of a basement room in New York's largest limited dividend housing project and went into the grocery 77 business. By fall it had taken on laundry distribution.<query> when did the knucklebocker village co op start</query> The Relation of Organized Workers and Consumers in Cooperatives It has also been possible to set up similar joint boards to act between the organized workers and consumers in the cooperative movement in many coun tries. In general the agreements entered into between cooperatives and their em ployees are based upon standard labor union contracts with somewhat of an in crease in wages or reduction in hours from the standard, in addition to vaca tions with pay, insurances and better working conditions. Coordinating 'boards are set up to deal with questions which arise as to relationships between the co operatives and their employees, as illus trated. Competitive vs. Cooperative Economic Organization In general the present economic system is illustrated by the chart of the two counters and the two wedges. On the side of the lower counter stand the producers—farmers, labor and pro fessionals. They come to the counter to sell their .products and services.<query> what is cooperative organization</query> In the beginning of 1937 the Village cooperators launched their credit union and by the end of the year, the co op had expanded to include 350 family members; and business had grown to $30,000 a year. April 19th the Knickerbocker Village Consumers Cooperative moved into a ground floor store—the largest in the Village. Consumer Distribution Corpora tion is assisting in the financing and man agement of the Knickerbocker Co-op. CO-OP CENSUS Washington, D. C.—The major sec tion of the census of the consumers cooperative movement in the United States recently completed by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in the field of the cooperative purchase of consumers goods 3,600 cooperative asso ciations with 677,000 individual members did a business of $182,685,000 in 1936. •Previous sections of the report, cover ing other types of consumers coopera tives, showed 3,728 cooperative tele phone associations with 330,000 indi-, vidual members; 259 electric supply co operatives serving 161,000 farm homes; 42 cooperative burial associations serving 27,000 members; and 35 cooperative housing associations with 2,200 family members.<query> when did the knucklebocker village co-op start</query> To these should be added another im portant group. Of the consumers cooper ative associations serving farm families, the report covers only those which deal in consumers goods (groceries, general merchandise, gas and oil, etc.) These represent 1,173 cooperative associations with 303,890 members doing an annual business of $111,998,641. A previous study by the Farm Credit Administration covering cooperative purchase of all types of goods by farm cooperatives showed an additional 939 cooperatives with 646,000 members that are coopera tive purchasing associations but do not handle consumers goods, thus making a total of farmers' purchasing cooperatives handling consumers goods and farm sup plies of 2,112 associations with an esti mated membership of 950,000 which did a business of $254,000,000 for the year ending June 30, 1936.

While most consumer cooperativ have been formed in rural areas ""orqarf ized labor is taking a new interest in th"" possibilities of cooperation and in th formation of cooperative enterprises Church groups are also manifesting a lively and growing interest in coopera tion."" The current report is based on answers to general questionnaires mailed to co operative associations plus field work in 13 states. Of the 3,600 consumers goods cooperatives 2,400 are cooperative store associations with 330,500 members and a business of $107,250,000; 1,150 are coop erative petroleum associations with 325,- 000 members and a business of $69,985,- 000; the other 50 are distributive associa tions with 22,250 members and business of $5,450,000.<query> how many cooperatives are there in the us</query> The typical American cooperative, ac cording to the report, has a membership of from 100 to 250 members. The associa tions handling petroleum products are found almost wholly in the Mississippi Valley. States with the largest number of cooperatives reported in the survey are Minnesota, with 224 associations with 64,000 individual members; Wisconsin, with 200 cooperatives having 51,000 members; Kansas, with 151 cooperatives reporting 21,000 members; Illinois, with 149 co-ops having 66,000 members; and Nebraska reporting 123 cooperatives with 25,600 members. Whi'le the report of the Bureau of La bor Statistics is not complete, it repre sents the most thorough-going study at tempted to date.

The camp, which is called Circle Pines Center, will be the headquarters, for ten weeks of training schools and institutes planned to deal with almost every phase of cooperative organization. In addition the camp will provide vacational and recreational fa cilities for the entire family—a kind of ""Cooperative Chautauqua."" Of particular interest is the announce ment in the prospectus of the Circle Pines Center that the Center ""affords oppor tunity for almost any type of outdoor recreation and nature study . . .<query> where is circle pines center</query> An in structor in recreation will be provided.

The pro ducers then go around to the other coun ter and buy back as consumers the prod ucts and services they have sold, after being processed, with a toll of profits and interest added. The job of business and bariking is to drive the wedges of profits and interest in farther—which means to force up the prices they charge the people as consumers and force down the pay they give to producers, in order to increase the profits of business and the interest of banking. What, then, is the answer? ; The second chart illustrates what the people are now beginning to organize to do—as consumers and producers to drive back the wedges of profits and interest and push the two counters together so that eventually, as producers, the people will bring to the counter all that they can produce and, as consumers, will divide it up in such a way that everyone will have the plenty which is now possible for alL RELATION OF LABOR AND CONSUMERS LABOR UNIONS COORDINATING BOARD Consumers' Cooperation PROFESSIONAL Jan CONSUMERS' COOPERATIVES MANUFACTURING , 1938 A Cooperative Economic Society ions and Consumers' Cooperativ "" Dr. Horace Kallen describes the ftV Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. free society as one where ""each cir e Wallace, says that ""a cooperative eco- the land would enter twice into er of nomic society will be the living stream of association with his fellows; once mic thought for the twentieth century as a sumer, with all his fellows;' once as ^"" ducer with the members only of his ^?"" industry or profession."" ra""- The ideal towards which we progressing is a self-contained econo^ society of producers and consumers deT ing directly with one another as orqan ized groups, in the same way that ' "" dividual producers and consumers on*1"" dealt directly with one another.<query> what is the job of a producer and consumer</query> How cooperatives educate their members.

For some time the Swedish cooperatives have had an engineer in America looking into practical production problems after con cluding their previous economic study. The real news in 'this activity which they plan to undertake is that ""as a first step the Board will begin negotiations for the purchase of the 'Forshaga factory, the principal one of its kind in Sweden.

Before we could quote any compara tive figures for manufacturing our visitor said, ""enough."" He knew that, in time, he could not possibly go up against such low cooperative percentages and survive in private-profit business.<query> what is the cooperative league</query> The wise thing is for private dealers and wholesalers to convert their businesses into coopera tives. Grocery wholesalers have now done it in large numbers, and now re tailers such as Frank Hawkins of Enid, Okla., wiho recently converted his two stores into consumers' cooperatives, are beginning to take the further step. The purchase of private food factories will naturally follow. Bor good measure, we added as our visitor left, ""And that's besides the hap piness which counts even more but can not be stated in percentages."" We hope another private business man has been converted to the cause of cooperation. Fascism Looms in Bituminous Coal The beginnings of Fascism are simple. They consist in price fixing by producer- finance ownership of production and dis tribution of any commodity, enforced by the political government. That is what the National Bituminous Coal Commis sion Act means.<query> who converted his grocery store into a cooperative</query> Here is another current illustration of the truth behind the false face of tlhe slogan ""less government in business."" Charles A. Beard exposed this fallacy five years ago in a notable article in 'Harpers Magazine in which he showed •that all the regulatory acts passed by Congress had been at tlhe behest of the majority of business in any line w'hich wanted to line-up tlhe minority and thus prevent the action of free-competition. The new coal act is popularly called a ""Coal Producers Law."" The Consumers' Cooperative Move ment presented its case recently before an open hearing of the Bituminous Coal Commission, demanding its right to be given wholesale discounts for rendering wholesale services. The key point is in the confusion between allowances, dis- dounts, rebates, etc. given by some pri vate distributors (which are entirely 82 foreign to cooperative practice and given by private distributors are incu in financial statements before profit figured), and the patronage returns^f savings (called profits by private bus ness) which are required to be paid shareholders of cooperatives on (he b '° of purchases.<query> what is the coal act</query> * Sls For tJhe organized consumer there ar two questions involved: the first is th right of consumers cooperatives to hand! any product and receive discounts com mensurate with the services rendered on an equal footing with private business- the second is whether such a law should' not be carried through the courts to cut off in its beginnings another head of the monster of Fascism which has appeared This, cooperators will eventually have to decide through their chosen Directors and Officers. Education Is Not A ""Loss"" Once we were so bold as to challenge the delegates to the annual meeting of Central Cooperative Wholesale of Super ior, Wisconsin, that the wording on a sign which they had on the back wall, directly in line with the vision of the speakers, should be reversed. It read something like this, ""We .should organ ize and educate."" We stated that we believed the word ""educate"" should be first.<query> what is the role of the cooperative consumer</query> The delegates applauded, so we are going to offer a further suggestion along similar lines as a comment on the 1937 financial statement of this ""super ior"" wholesale located at Superior, Wis consin. A summary of their ""Income and Expense Statement"" is as follows: Sales ...................... $3,340,125.81 Cost of Sales ................. 3,098,992.19 Margin .................... 241,133.62 Expenses ................... 156,740.27 Gain 84,393.35 To this ""Gain"" is added $401.75 as the result of Auditing and from this a- mount is deducted as ""Loss"" the sum of $7,884.95 for Education. Since When, and why, might we ask, is expense for Ed ucation a ""Loss"" in a Cooperative? Why should Education be singled out as a loss any more than the warehousing, purchasing, accounting, management or any other expense of the business? It's not yet certain that an efficient Consumers' Cooperation education Department in a Cooper- t-ve is n°t the most important ""Gain"" J nartment of all.<query> is education expense a loss</query> Fortu* nately, we, in the United States, do not have to depend entirely upon theoretical idealism. In the Scandinavian countries these ideals have been applied and have proven to be thoroughly practical. It js only for us to follow their example and apply them to American conditions. What we need in America is not so much either theorizing or even original think ing—both of these have been largely done for us.

As' comprehensive a summary as has been made of the future cooperative eco nomic society of organized producers and consumers is contained in Beatrice Webb's pamphlet ""The Discovery of the Consumer.""

Then it will be more definitely realized by the delegates that it is a necessary part of the Expenses, just as much or perhaps more so than any other Expense item, to be deducted before fig uring Gain, rather than a Loss to be de ducted after Gain is figured, which leads to the inference that it might possibly be dispensed with more easily than any other Expense item.<query> why is education important in a cooperative</query> All Expense items, whether educa tion, warehousing, purchasing, account ing or management, should either be listed as Loss, or none of them be so list ed when final financial statements are issued. That the delegates to the Cen tral Wholesale annual meeting do not consider Education to be a Loss is, how ever, proven by the fact that they in creased the Educational budget for 1938 by 50% to $12,000. ""Study-Circle"" Idea Taking Hold In U. S. A. It is said that ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."" Apparent ly the Swedish study-circle idea is even more appealing to Americans under varia tions of the name ""Study-Circle"" than under its original name. The Extension Department of St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Sco- 'ia has developed study-circles to a greater degree than any other organiza tion in North America under the name Study-Clubs."" They have organized more than twelve hundred study clubs •n only seven counties.<query> what is the study circle</query> The Oh'io Farm Bureau and its affil- lated Cooperatives of Columbus, Ohio, sent their secretary and one of their ed- 1938 ucational staff to Nova Scotia two years ago and have since organized more than three hundred ""Advisory Councils."" They also use the small ""Discussion- Circle"" method in week-end institutes and at their annual meetings. Consumers Cooperative Association of North Kansas City, Missouri, called them ""Discussion Groups"" when they organized a five months' employee train ing program last winter. An appealing alliterative variation of the name is ""Neighbourhood-Nights,"" now being developed by Midland Co operative Wholesale of Minneapolis. The Milwaukee County Consumers Cooperative Association of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, uses the name ""Cooperative Classes."" At Fargo, North Dakota, a group has just met at the North Dakota Agricultural College to organize ""Neigh borhood Meetings."" The Vermont State Farm Bureau at Burlington, Vermont, has completed a series of forty-one ""Study Clubs"" averaging fourteen per sons, using the Nova Scotia name.<query> what is the name of the cooperatives in milwaukee</query> The important fact .is that, even if American Cooperators are still ""individ ualistic"" enough to want to coin original names, which is a virtue rather than a fault, we have accepted and are on the way to rapidly adopt the Swedish-Nova Scotia idea of small discussion groups as the best means of adult education yet devised. Study clubs have been proven best both as a means of getting informa tion from the leaders to the members and also from the point of view of getting suggestions from the members to the leaders. NATIONAL CONFERENCE Editors of the major cooperative papers in the United States and educa tion, recreation and publicity directors oif regional cooperatives, district leagues and retail associations will hold their annual three-day conference at Hull House Camp, Waukegan, Illi nois, June 23, 24 and 25, under the auspices of The Cooperative League.<query> what is the purpose of a study club</query> The co-op conference wil consider major problems of cooperative policy and discuss programs of education for the coming year.

Tomp- £ s began the work of regeneration hat has gone triumphantly ,on, gather- kins ing ~pOR the past several years the educa- •*- tional work being carried on by St. Francis Xavier University has been at tracting the attention of American co- operators. Those who have visited eastern Nova Scotia have seen in the co operatives growing up in fishing and farming communities and mining towns something unique and progressive in philosophy and action. St. Francis Xa vier University has made a profound impression on these visiting coopera- tors, so profound indeed that many now agree that Nova Scotia is perhaps the most significant field of cooperation on the continent.<query> what is the co-op conference</query> True Democracy Visualized In the book, ""The Lord Helps Those"" the writer has attempted to summarize and evaluate the movement that has come out of Antigonish to give new life and hope to stranded and poverty- stricken communities. Out of the study and summarization have come certain definite implications that are of great import to the whole American move ment. In the columns of Consumers' Coop eration the writer has previously given 'his own brief summary of the Nova Scotian experiment. That summary strove to show that the Nova Scotian leaders had actually gotten a vision of true democracy and were working to unveil that vision to fishermen, farmers and industrial workers. Today certain new appearances in Nova Scotia prove conclusively that cooperation has en tered a new stage, vindicating the earl ier theories and rules laid down by the Antigonish educational leaders. To show clearly the import and meaning of the Antigonish movement it is necessary to trace distinctions and differences be tween the work done in Nova Scotia and that done in many parts of the United States.<query> what was the antigonish movement</query> None of the distinctions or differences are intended in an invidr ious sense but rather as points which the movement in the United States should study and absorb. The consumer cooperative movement in the United States was started in tli majority of cases by farm leaders wh adopted the technique and began t build their units of cooperative ent ° prise upon a purely economic foundT tion. Since economic pressure was for "" ing the farmers and workers to study and action and because of the tremen dous pressure of organized exploitation it was logical that the first units should have been so conceived and built. Too, the religious and educational leaders of the United States did not early recognize the fundamental mean ing of the consumer cooperative move ment. Therefore the ipurely spiritual and ethical content that only these men could pour into the movement was in most cases lacking.<query> why was the consumer cooperative movement started</query> That such a con cept of cooperation is now actually ap pearing in the United States is due in no small part to the influence and guidance given by those educators and religious leaders wftio have been at tracted by the movement and have be gun to interpret it intellectually and ethically. Economics Founded On Ethics In Nova Scotia the whole movement rose directly out of the ranks of the educators and priests. These men were interested primarily in the regeneration and cultural awakening of the people and accepted an economic technique as vitally important but still secondary to the primary necessity of cultural and spiritual rebirth. The whole program of cooperative action in Nova Scotia has been carried forward on that 'basis. In eadh of the tiny farming and fish ing communities the primary evil was that of apathy and ignorance that stemmed directly from the root of pov erty..<query> why was the cooperative economics movement founded on ethics</query> Therefore the pioneer priests who began to preach cooperative action voiced their message in terms of a cul tural and ethical renaissance. Practically every cooperator has read the story of Little Dover, that fishing village on the eastern slhore of Nova Scotia where the people had been re duced to abject and soul-destroying pov- Consumers' Cooperation strength and scope with the pass- . o years. Dr. Tompkins has said repeatedly that A£ one important thing was to get these overty-enslaved people to lift up their Lads and1 begin to think for themselves. ue did not care greatly what definite ourse of action they should take when •hey began to think. For he was con vinced from the start that the action would be right. Therefore the real mes sage he carried to Little Dover was one Of necessity for straight thinking.! The lobster factory at Little Dover, first of the many that now are strung along the coast of the Maritime Prov inces rose, not so much from a care fully conceived and worked out plan of action as it did from the awakened and energized minds of the people.<query> why was the little dover story important</query> Be cause of this the important phase of the building of that first lobster factory lay in the fact that the people gave freely of their labor and scanty resources to build it with their own hands. Thus that factory, and t3he many which fol lowed it, was founded on the bed rock of an awakened intelligence and power that had been dormant for generations. The increased income that is now flowing to the people of Little Dover from this unit of production is some thing more than a mere economic gain. To them it is important because it proves what Dr. Tomipkins had been telling them for years, namely, that they were just as smart, just as resourceful and powerful as the men who had been exploiting them. Thus he replaced the mere resentment upon which so many cooperatives have been built by some thing more powerful and constructive.<query> why was the lobster factory important</query> bers (in what we now Icnow as the cooperative society) and obligatory association of citizens (in the economic enterprises of national as well as lo cal government) — all of them in organic connec tion with an equally ubi quitous organization of the producers by hand or by brain (in farm cooper atives, trade unions and professional associations) which will constitute the greater part of the social order of a hundred years hence."" Toyohiko Kagawa of Japan, considered iby many as the world's most practical idealist says, ""if producers and consumers come together in a spirit of cooDeration, then so ciety has coordination. Then producers are con sumers and consumers are producers . . .

These men accepted the tech nique of the credit union from the United States. They lifted the whole idea bodily from their cousins across 'he line. But they set it on a far dif ferent foundation. While the credit union in the United States was in most instances an entity in and of itself, it became something far different in Nova Scotia. In the fishing, farming and in dustrial communities there it became the first unit in ithe new economic structure which these men and women were at tempting to build. Therefore these peo ple met in their little study clubs and studied the whole problem of credit as it touched them, their communities and society in general.<query> what was the credit union approach</query> The credit union became the first step in their cooperative march out of the desert of a profit-controlled econ omy. The tiny sums so collected were looked upon, not as a mere reservoir for the supiply of personal loans, but as a source upon which they should draw for the rebuilding of the community. Out of these tiny credit unions have come the stores, the lobster factories, the sawmills and other cooperative pro ducing units in the rural areas. In the mining towns even more fundamental community enterprises are now rising. In doing this the Nova Scotians have given a totally new dimension to the credit union technique; one that must be studied in the United States if we are ever to make use of those resources of the people which now are allowed1 to remain in the hands of the exploiters. The Co-op Store — Basis of the New Community As with the credit union so with the cooperative store.<query> what was the credit union</query> In too many com munities all over the world the coop erative store idea is presented to the people on a basis of possible patronage dividends and, therefore, as containing nothing more promising than increased purchasing power. In Consumer Coop eration again the Nova Scotians bor rowed from the United States as well as from Great Britain and the Scandin avian countries. And again they re interpreted and enlarged upon the thes is they accepted. The cooperative store, the study club members learned, was another unit in the new community. It •was tremendously important because only when they proved their ability as consumers to carry on their own busi ness and serve themselves economically and efficiently could they go on to big- I June, 1938 •ger and deeper considerations and en terprises. In village after village the credit tinion was used to (prepare the way for the store.<query> why was the cooperative store important</query> The chronic evil of store credit in Nova Scotia was considered incurable by most observers. Through the credit unions the evil was obliterated in village after village. When this was done the store was opened on a cash basis. Store and credit union thus worked hand in liand at the job of emancipation. The study clubs were organized and became the real foundation of educa tion, economic, ethical and cultural. These study clubs were the real per manent centre of the community since they were not set up to carry through a course of study which was to be laid aside when economic action began. They were set up as permanent organ izations through which the fishermen and workers should begin a never-end ing march upward and forward. Co-op Medicine, Housing and Burial In St. Andrews the farmer members of the community cooperatives began some time ago to face the fact that the purely economic units must be linked with social services.<query> why were study clubs organized</query> Facing this fact the members of the cooperatives entered in to an agreement with a hospital at Antig- onish, whereby the cooperative paid to the hospital a fixed sum per member. The memibers, in return, were insured against sickness ; were given certain fixed services in hospitalization and medical care. In the same manner the miners in Cape Breton have advanced beyond the store and credit union stage to new and Wiide developments in the field of coop eration. These miners have built up their credit unions until today they are sound and substantial banks of the peo ple. With the credit so pooled they have built their stores. Last year one group bepan to study cooperative hous ing. The first ten men organized a hous ing cooperative and spent twenty-six weeks in exhaustive study of the whole field of .housing. Mary Arnold, formerly leader in the development of cooperative services in New York City, having had actual ex perience in the housing field, went to «6 Nova Scotia last year and ,uined extension staff of St. Francis Y University.<query> who were the first cooperatives</query> Under her leadership^ ten men of the first cooperative h ing group planned their homes 7v~ spring they are building the first' arn, of houses. y OUP These men have advanced mere cooperative distribution to a where they are beginning to live eration instead of simply applyina the field of credit and store k< Two additional study groups formed to follow the lead of the fif! organization. In these study clubs thev are now talking of cooperative utilities hospitalization, burial societies and th like. They are, in other words, beqin ning to understand that cooperation in its various phases is as wide as our whole continental scene, touching every phase of life. y Cooperative Design for Living In the .dralb mining areas of Cape Breton there has been started, as a re sult of work and study, the beginning of the first real home-owning develop ment in the history of the area.<query> what was the first cooperative society</query> To pre dict that this new move will change the whole attitude and outlook of these miners is to simply state the obvious fact. According to Miss Arnold, the most important outgrowth of tHe coopera tive housing study has been the gradual and apparent rise in outlook and appré ciation among the miners. Through their studies they have begun to visualize bet ter and more beautiful homes. Their studies are taking them away from the grimy environs of the mines to open country nearby. Thus a real culture is now beginning to appear, revitalizing and reforming the outlook of the miners. The Link Between Social Laws and Their Application Through the cooperative housing study in Nova Scotia something else important is being proven. These miners. in taking advantage of a Provincial Housing Act, are showing the real link between broad social laws enacted by Parliament and ithe actual application of those laws through the economic units set up by the people.<query> why is cooperative housing important</query> Consumers' Cooperation The Housing Act, passed some years qOi set aside certain funds to be loaned to iow- ount of $1,610,000,000; clothing to an amount of $1,150,000,000; and house 'urnishings totaling $860,000.000. These 'JjJures cover only farmers' purchases; tlley do not indude the purchases of Consumers' Cooperation June, 1935 urban residents, which are even more largely in the lines of food, clothing and shelter. There is no good reason why one wholesale cooperative in a trading area and one retail cooperative in a trading area cannot serve practically all of the needs of all consumers most efficiently and economically. Departmentalizing of wholesale and retail cooperatives has proven to be highly successful from an efficiency standpoint. From a mem bers' standpoint, it is far better to .con centrate one's interest and time in one cooperative purchasing organization t'han in several.<query> what is the difference between a wholesale cooperative and a retail cooperative</query> Those who are now leaders of whole sale and retail cooperatives in America as Managers or Directors should lead out as rapidly as practical in adding other lines or products so as to increas ingly serve more and more of the needs of all the consumers of their trading area. Proper Legislation Should Encourage Sound Cooperative Organization It is only on the basis of a correct understanding of Consumers' Coopera tion as including the purchase of all forms of food, goods and services for users, irrespective of their vocation, res idence, religion, race or politics; together with a practical knowledge of the ne cessity of cooperatives serving all con sumers of products in order to meet private competition and be the most suc cessful as economic units, tihat the right kind of legislation can 'be formulated. Any legislation which has to do with the right to organize and incorporate, or with the right to .handle products and receive discounts in accordance with the services rendered, such as, for ex ample, the handling of coal under the National Bituminous Coal Commission Act, should be so drawn that -there is no differentiation between Consumers' Cooperatives, irrespective of the voca tion or residence of their membership.<query> what kind of legislation should be formulated to encourage cooperatives</query> Such acts should, likewise, recognize the rights of all cooperatives to pur chase and receive discounts equally with private dlistributors, and not con fuse the patronage return required to be paid by cooperatives to their share holders with any special discounts, al- 89 i N lowances, rebates, etc., allowed by pri vate dealers. Legislation having to do with taxa tion should also be drawn to treat all cooperative purdhasing associations a- like. Proper legislation will not, as the present revenue acts do, discriminate be tween rural and urban cooperative pur chasing associations in the matter of taxation of the amounts paid as inter est on shares, or in the amounts voted to surplus, and exempt rural coopera tives and not urfoan cooperatives. The savings of a cooperative are only a part of the earned incomes of its members which they have paid in as overcharges on their purchases anidl on which they are personally taxed.<query> are cooperatives taxed</query> * nal program as a foundation for them.

It comes first in the title and it therefore comes first in their pro gram. Growing Cooperatives— A Greater Need for Education Each state has a well-developed pro gram of Junior education, under super vision of a state director. But as the co operative businesses sprang up in greater and greater numbers, a need was felt for a coordinating office which could assist in keeping the educational program apace with the cooperative development.<query> what is the farmers union</query> To re-tax in the form of interest or surplus is plainly multiple taxation. Unban cooperatives do not make profits any more than do rural cooperatives. Since sound coop erative organization requires that co operatives serve all users of products irrespective of their residence or vo cation, the exemption o'f one type of cooperatives and not of another will only result in interference by legisla tion with sound cooperative organiza tion, in addition to being plainly dis criminatory and unfair practice on the part of the government. If the government is to handle credit, as it is increasingly doing, then any legislation having to do with credits to cooperatives should neither be •discrim inatory nor interfere with sound coop erative development. The Farm Credit Administration Act, giving credits only to cooperative purchasinq associations whose membership is made up of farm ers, and only for trie purchase of farm supplies is discriminatory and inter feres with sound cooperative develop ment.<query> what is the government doing with cooperatives</query> As a matter of justice, there is no valid reason why 'Consumers' Coop erative purchasing associations should not receive low interest credits on an equal basis whether their membership is all rural or aü urban, or part rural and part urban, and irrespective of whether t!he products they purchase are house hold supplies or vocational supplies. As a matter of cooperative organization, it is an unwise requirement in the making of such loans to influence cooperatives to limit their membership to one voca tional group when, to be the most sue- 90 oessful and meet private business 0 equal terms, they must ' open up the"" membership to all consumers of tl/ products handled. It is equally unwise to discriminate, in making loans, be tween the kinds of products purchased and refuse to make loans for household supplies as well as vocational suppHes<query> why is it unwise to limit cooperative membership</query> The Cooperative League has in its membership more wholesale and retail cooperative associations which are now made up principally of rural than of ur ban memibers. Yet, such rural member ship cooperatives, as well as urban membership cooperatives, stand for ab solute legislative equality among them selves, and between themselves, as a whole, and private business. W'hat all want is legislation that we will neither be discriminatory tween rural or urban groups, nor which by any discrimination will influence co operatives to develop other than sound cooperative organizations by restrict ing their membership to only part of the consumers of the products they han dle or limiting the products thev sell. This is the goal we seek — A cor rect classification o£ Consumers' Co operatives to include all types of food, goods and services purchased by users; membership open to all users of the pro ducts handled; proper legislation, which is neither discriminatory between coop eratives nor which will influence them to limit membership or the Unes they handle and thus eventuallv develop co operative organizations which are less efficient than they might be.<query> what is the goal of a cooperative</query> TAKE A TRIP TO NOVA SCOTIA Dr. J.

Colwell Consumers' Cooperation STUDENT leaders on the campuses of the Universities of Idaho, California, Oregon, Washington, and Washington State College almost simultaneously rec ognized the cooperative movement as a means of making democratic group life available to students with moderate school budgets. George S. Tanner, Di rector of tihe L. D. S. Institute, began the movement with 22 men on the Uni versity of Idaho campus in 1932. Harry Kingman, General Secretary of t'he University of California YMCA, took the leadership in organizing the first cooperative house in Berkeley in 1933. Walter Honderich, a graduate student interested in practical sociology, (lathered together 27 men and beqan the first cooperative 'house at the Uni versity of Washington in September 1933.

A rather unusual open ing for the smash New York musical hit of tihe season.<query> what is the theme song for pins and needles</query> But not so unusual if you look behind the first line chorus of ""Pins and Needles"" into the broad cul tural and educational program of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union which is responsible for the play. The Garment Workers Capture Broadway ""Pins and Needles,"" much to every one's surprise, particularly the critics, has proved to be a smash hit. It is prac tically impossible to secure tickets for the New York show unless they are secured months in advance and already two road companies have been sent out. The popularity of the musical revue lies chiefly in the satirical treatment of seri ous subject matter. The actors poke fun not only at stuffed shirts, such as ""Mussolini"" in ""Public Enemy No. 1"" and at international politics in an amus ing skit entitled, ""Four Little Angels of Peace"" (Hitler, Mussolini, Chamber lain and a Japanese) but there is a great deal of laughter at the expense of labor itself.<query> who is the garment workers union</query> A keen sense of humor is at the bottom of every skit and a spirit of good fun permeates the cast whether they are singing of ""One Big Union for Two"" or wailing of the sad plight of the 92 young girl who, though she uses all the advertised powders, creams and lotions all the boys pass her by. The freshness, energy and gootj spirits of the members of ""Pins and Needles"" is one of the outstanding con tributions to its enjoyment and success And these same musical stars are, or rather were, cutters, dressmakers, press ers, stitchers, etc., in the garment in dustry in New York City. The success of these young men and women is not as spectacular and dramatic as it would seem to those who know nothing of the purpose of Labor Stage, producer of ""Pins and Needles"" and the Internation al Ladiies Garment Workers Union, sponsor of Labor Stage.<query> who is the cast of pins and needles</query> So the Farmers Union Cooperative Education Service came into being. In North Dako ta, for instance, cooperative oil compa nies affiliated with the Central Exchange, blanket the state in a network of cooper atives. It is the proud boast of the Farm ers Union membership that a man may traverse the entire state and never put a : gallon of any but cooperatively owned i gasoline in his gas tank. The coopera tives rank second only to Standard Oil in North Dakota. The Farmers Union membership owns not only petroleum cooperatives, but creameries, elevators, shipping associa tions, poultry and egg processing plants, stores and credit unions. Only a thorough jjira constant educational program could *eep this varied group of cooperatives 3we and functioning. To meet the need tor added educational facilities, the state January, 1938 organizations of Farmers Union, together with the Farmers Union Central Ex change and other terminal businesses, owned by the states, formed a central education office called the Farmers Union Cooperative Education Service.<query> what is the farmers union</query> For more than a year, Louis Schaffler, director of La bor Stage, nursed and coddled ""Pins and Needles"" until it was ready for Broadway presentation. And behind that is the presentation of ""Steel,"" widely acclaimed as a timely, forceful play. La bor Stage, organized two years ago, aims ""to be instrumental in developing a new kind of theater, alive and res ponsive to the important tremdls in cur rent American life."" It is perhaps the most well known of the activities of the Educational Department of the I. L. G. W. U. but is only a small section of the whole broad cultural and recreation program under the direction of this pro gressive trade union. Labor Educates Itself The Educational Department of the I. L. G. W. U. was organized in 1916 and has three main functions. The first is the education of the vast member ship of the union.<query> what is the purpose of the i.l.g.w.u.</query> This is the most ex tensive division. In it are included edu cational meetings, lectures, excursions Consumers' Cooperation j visits to museums, art galleries and 8ther places of interest. All sorts of reational and cultural opportunities f£ provided, such as games, sports, dancing, dramatics and music. TThe second division comprises the smaller groups thait meet weekly for the systematic study of such subjects as economics, social history and history of the American labor movement, English, journalism and public speaking. The third division provides practical training 'for union members who are likely to assume positions of responsi bility, paid or unpaid, in labor unions. Of primary concern to persons inter ested in creative recreation is the first division, that of providing cultural and recreational opportunities for the mem bership of the I. L. G. W. U. It is wise to point out that these classes are open to all and are not restricted to union membership, although, of course, the most active participants are union mem bers.<query> what is the third division of labor</query> The Educational Department re ported that during the year ending May, 1937, there were more than 553 groups with more than 20,000 students weekly, in all sections of the country. In New York City where the largest percentage of the membership is concentrated, the recreational activities are particularly numerous. These activities include a chorus of 120. voices, a band, a Mando lin Orchestra olf 70 pieces, a dramatics, group, responsible for the two previous ly mentioned plays, ""Steel"" and ""Pins and Needles"" as well as many one-act plays and skits, and a Dance Group. In die list of outstanding events during 1936 and 1937, we find the presentation of several operas, original one-act plays, annual concert by the New York Cho rus, showing of WPA paintings, Man dolin orchestra with the Humphrey- Weidman dancers as guests, pageant, "".Surging Forward"" presented at St. Louis and frequent mention of radio programs and use of films, film strips and victrola records.<query> what was the most popular recreational activity in nyc</query> The concrete results of this educa tional program cannot be summed up in black and white. What is important is that the people themselves are creating their own cultural expression. While there are educational directors and a central educational office which assists in many different ways such as furnishing material, giving advice and direction, the members themselves are creating the impetus for the whole pro gram. Education for Creative Leisure It is also highly important to point out that the organization which has de veloped this well-rounded educational program is responsible to a large ex tent in cutting down the hours of labor for thousands of working people. They have had the vision to provide leisure time activities to enrich the lives of these same people. It is a definite chal lenge to all groups such as trade unions and! cooperatives which are working for a better social order not only to help people decrease the hours of toil but to enable them to use their new leisure time to the fullest — to learn to play and laugh together.<query> why is it important to provide educational programs</query> The I. L. G. W. U. proudly states that ""Besides aiding our members to gain a greater measure oif the material comforts of life, we do all we can to make their lives fuller, gayer and more cultured.

Recently it was revealed that ""great joy"" had been brought to Pope Pius XI because of the work of the Extension Department of St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia.<query> where is nova scotia</query> This book let tells what 91 people from the United States and Canada saw and found in eastern Nova Scotia in the summer of 1937. The pamphlet was written by a score or more of the people who took part in the conference tour. It contains several of the most important descriptions yet made of the significant program in adult education and the cooperatives, for ex ample, those by Dr. M. M. Coady and Dr. J. J. Tomjpkins. Th-e notes and impressions of numerous members of the tour are included. Dr. J. Henry Carpenter of Brooklyn, N. Y., the tour üeader, writes an introduction. This is the story of a university that decided to educate adults for action; of a university that decided its future was bound up with the welfare of the farmers, fishermen and miners; of a uni versity that deliberately pointed its education to ward the organization of credit unions, coopera tive stores, cooperative lobster factories.<query> who wrote the pamphlet on the cooperatives</query> In De cember, 1931, I was in eastern Nova Scotia and I found in the rural areas and the fishing villages not one credit union, not one lobster factory, a few cooperative stores. As a result of the spiritual and educational dynamic of the ""men of An tigonish"" one finds in 1938 120 credit unions, 35 cooperative stores, 25 cooperative fish plants. These have grown out of over 1,000 study clubs with more than 12,000 members. The movement has recently spread to New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is'land, Quebec and Newfoundland.

Juniors learn to speak adequately and briefly upon a current topic through the four-minute speech project which also culminates in a national contest. Out of the four-minute speech project which was originated in North Dakota has grown the minuteman project. Young people desirous of gaining additional experience in public speaking, meet with various groups and deliver speeches upon the co operative movement. A final qualifying speech is then given, upon which the speaker must be prepared to answer questions asked by the audience.

How shall we cleanse ourselves from our guilt? The answer .can no longer be found in the efforts of each family, in the struggling of individual parents and their children. The answer can only be found in the rapid growth of conviction of .social guilt over the tragic results of our private profit economic system in poverty, unemploy ment and tenancy, together with an energetic determination to apply the spirit of brotherhood to the building of a cooperative economic society that will serve ""all the children of all the people,"" — that will distribute plenty to all and bring peace on earth.<query> why do we need to cleanse ourselves from our guilt</query> Consumers' Coopération 411 organ to spread the knowledge of the Consumers' Cooperative Movement, whereby the people In voluntary association, purchase and produce for their own use the things they need.

Beard offers the follow ing advice to grown-up boys and girls in America: ""If we cannot solve even the problem of putting 10,000,000 of our own citizens to work on the lavish resources right at hand, or have collective security at home, how can we have the effrontery to assume that we can solve the problems of Asia and Europe, encrusted in the blood-rust of fifty centuries?<query> when did cooperative league start</query> Really, little boys and girls, how can we?"" Conspicuous Waste We imagine that if Veblen were alive today he would use an advertisement of a bill clip for college students priced at $34 as a glaring illustration of the ex pression he coined of ""conspicuous waste."" ""Capitalism Is Doomed"" That Capitalism is ""finished,"" is ""in solvent,"" and is ""doomed"" is presented most lucidly by Virgil Michel in an ar ticle in the April 29, 1938, issue of The Commonweal. We congratulate the new editors, Philip Burnham and Edward Skillin, Jr., on publishing this article as well as the author on writing it. The ""why"" is stated by Virgil Michel in this most explicit sentence, ""Capitalist activity can in reality flourish and in crease only through an increase of pur chasing power among the rank and file of the people, whereas the dynamism of capitalism depends on and demands the ever greater accumulation of capital in the hands of the few."" There you have it in a nut shell!<query> who said capitalism is doomed</query> Why is capitalism doomed, insolvent, finished? Because continuous and widespread dis tribution of purchasing power is funda mentally necessary for a steady increase in distribution and production which makes an economic system a success. Capitalism cuts its own throat by in creasingly concentrating purchasing power and ownership in the hands of the few. This is t!he malignant cancer within the system that is steadily and rapidly destroying it. The government has had to come in to supply the two crutches of spending and lending because of the failure of business to supply pay to producers and the fail ure of banking to supply credit. This is 98 only a stop-gap to permit 'Capitalism to survive long enough to enable the peonl to build a new cooperative system wh ownership and purchasing power will^ distributed widely to all the people O * ly then will we have economic pros"" perity.<query> why is capitalism doomed</query> It is a case, of cooperation or chaos. Pricing Under Profit vs Cooperative Business The Cooperative Wholesale Society of England prices every shipment made on any one day exactly the same, irres pective of the quantity, and at exactly the same terms. In comparison with this cooperative practice by the biggest busi ness in Great Britain, Secretary of Agri culture Wallace has ordered Swift 6 Co Chicago packers, to cease ""discriminato ry an(d deceptive practices"" by varyinq prices, weights and credit to different customers. The company defends its sales practices, contending that ""in this in dustry it is not, and would not be, pos sible either to maintain uniform prices or •to maintain a uniform differential in prices between ' two or more classes of customers, either at one branch house or between two or more branch houses."" This as well as the fact that it is monop olized is a reason why meat processing and distribution must be cooperatized.<query> what is cooperative pricing</query> It must be made 'honest, as well as eco nomical and efficient as it is not now. Governor Murphy's Pertinent Answer In answer to a criticism which said ""You have spoiled the laboring people. Now they even want electric sweepers and refrigerators in their homes,"" Gov ernor Murphy of Michigan made this pertinent reply, ""Well, why not? They make them."" Governotr Murphy said, ""We have the wealth, the resources and the individual genius to solve this terrible situation. No one can convince me otherwise. I know it can be done."" Michigan cooperators should do as co- operators in other states have already done in the case of Governors Aiken of Vermont, Earle o'f Pennsylvania, La Fol lette of Wisconsin and Benson of Minne sota—they should educate their governor to the solutions of the unemployment situation in that state about which he is so greatly troubled.<query> who said we have the wealth, resources and individual genius to solve this terrible situation. no one pumper Farm Crops • Bumper Factory Unemployment Bumper Government Relief \\fie are dealing in superlatives now in the United States. A single issue of the great New York Times reports that we have ""bumper"" everything—crops, un employment and relief. Just how ditHt 'happen that we began to call ourselves a civilized nation when we took over America from the Indians? Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wal lace, once wrote an editorial when he was with Wallace's Farmer in which he described the Blackhawks in beautiful and memorable words such as these, ""When the ears of corn hung heavy on the banks along the Rocik river and the deer came down in droves to drink, then the Indians in the days of Blackhawk knew that they had prosperity."" Why is it then that we civilized (?) Americans do not have prosperity for all when we raise bumper crops, as the na tive Americans whom we calldd ""uncivil ized"" did?<query> why did the blackhawks begin to call themselves a civilized nation</query> Is it because we are more selfish or more ignorant than they were? Or might it be that we are socially in sane, if we are not ready to admit that we are individually so? ""Thou Shalt Not Steal!"" We recently asked Dr. J. J. Tompkins, the spiritual and intellectual father of the Antigonish Movement for adult educa tion and cooperative organization, what were the underlying philosophies which he has followed in his years of effort. From a religious standpoint, he sum marized his philosophy by saying that a leader should ""live dangerously"" and should ""have faith in the people."" From an educational standpoint, he believes, like Dr. ' Oscar Olssen of Sweden, orig inator of the study circle movement, (hat if a small group of people would gather around a great piece of literature and select their own leader they would eventually arrive at an understanding and solution of their problems through mutual self-help.<query> who is jj tompkins</query> From an economic standpoint, he believed in the building of an economic system where the people Could follow out the commandment Thou shalt not steal,"" which meant a non-profit, democratically controlled co operative system owned by the people. Consumers' Cooperation July> 1938 America's Foreign Policy The foreign policy of America is ide- scribed by Senator Walsh of Massachu setts, Chairman of the Naval Affairs- Committee as follows: ""The foreign policy of this country depends- upon the state of mind of the President and the State Department at any given time un der a given state of facts."" This ought to be an indication to raiore Americans that political democracy does- not give the people control over cur for eign policy, any more than over our do mestic policy, and that such democratic control can never be achieved except through the development of economic as.<query> who developed the foreign policy of the united states</query> Thereafter, when there is need of a speaker in that minuteman's territory, he is assigned the job. Minute- men have done fine work in organizing and selling share capital in new. coopera tives. They have worked for peace legis lation and have done a splendid job of publicizing cooperative enterprise. The minuteman badge is an oxidized silver disk bearing the insignia of a lan tern. The task of the minutemen is to keep the light of knowledge burning, to awaken their sleeping fellows to their need to band together. Girls as well as boys become minutemen. Cooperative Summer Camps Summer camps were started for the Junior members, as was all the rest of the educational program of the Farmers Union. Like the rest of the program, they now take in all age groups. Subjects taught in summer camps are: public speaking since no one may be a truly capable cooperator unless he is able to express himself; parliamentary usage-— since cooperators must operate their own businesses and must know the rules by which they can do so; social problems-— because cooperators must know what forces are at work in the world today, the relationship of one group of society to another, and the effect of the various problems of society upon the individual; cooperative history and principles^~be- cause cooperators must know what has gone before, and what principles to ap ply in solving their problems; and com munity recreation, drama and handicraft —because the cooperative movement is by nature a folk movement and people must learn to play together if they are ever to learn to work together.<query> what is the task of a minuteman</query> well as political democracy. Denmark Celebrates the 150th Anniversary of the Abolition of Villeinage Only 150 years ago the farmers of Denmark were serfs under the feudal system as well as being subject to com pulsory military service 'which gave the landlords power to recruit every man. Without .revolt or bloodshed, but through legislation initiated by one of Denmark's biggest landowners, Christian Ditlev Reventlow, the liberation of the peasants was accomplished. Each peasant became the owner of his own homestead and farm. So did we, in America, a hundred and fifty years ago begin to divide up our agricultural acreage into family size farms. But now 42% of our farmers are tenants, 48% of OUT acreage is tenant operated and in some states as much as 70% of the value of farm property is no longer owned by the operators.<query> when did the denmark farmers become farmers</query> Yet in Denmark, according to a recent official report, ""there is no longer any farm tenancy."" What has made the striking difference? Well the booklet which our Danish Co operative friends have sent us gives two specific reasons. The first reason is that ""the cooperative movement has been one of the main factors in the remarkable de velopment which during the past sixty yea.rs has taken place in Danish agri cultural production and exports."" The second reason given is that of ""Den mark's Folk High Schools."" Surely there is no reason for a moral to be drawn. 99 I"" J A TRIBUTE TO H. V. NURMI Little do we really know of one another in the Cooperative Movement although we axe all united in one great cause. The great distances between regional cooperatives, which in many cases cover areas greater than an entire country in Europe, makes it impossible for us to have more than a comparatively few hours df intimate personal conversations where one's real self is revealed.<query> why is there no farm tenancy in denmark</query> But perhaps it is even more in the heat of discussion in public meetings that one demonstrates his real nature. A few expressions in the public statements and1 private conversations of the late H. V. Nurmi which have been indelibly fixed in our mind are, we feel, a true revelation of his life. Our first contact with him was before we had entered the Coopera tive Movement and the impression of his friendly attitude toward every one has always continued. We admired him for his modesty in once stating that 'his ambition had never been to be General Manager of the institution of which his Me was so much a (part but only to continue .to handle the auditing work. The idealism he expressed for ,the Cooperative Movement, in a few sentences which he airways included in his annual report, impressed us with a purpose far wider than the clear statistics showing .the efficiency and econ omy of operations under his management, for which we admired him greatly.<query> who was hv nurmi</query> When we commented upon the comparatively youthful age of the assistants he had been building up around him his answer was that he wanted only a few years longer to transfer the responsibilities over onto the shoulders olf young men who could carry on for long years the ex panding program. Our last contact with him was to see him in action in a meeting o'f National Cooperatives, Inc., where he took the lead in ac tively helping to solve various problems .successlfully, and in a later two hour personal conversation discussing the subject of national legislation in which he was greatly interested. Until his voluntary retirement from the position in the fall df 1936 he was for 'many years a Director of The Cooperative League and in that capacity was, with Miss Mary E. Arnold, treasurer, the backbone of the early moves taken to raise a budget which eventually made the League a self-supporting organization.<query> who was the director of the cooperative league</query> We cannot but feel that it was his wish to die at his post, but only after many more years of service. A heart attack overtook him while he was preparing for the annual meeting. He was another example, like John T. W. Mitchell of England, of a leader with vision and ability who died at his post of duty and contributed igreatly toward the building of a coop erative economic society. In his honour, we are reproducing extracts from1 his report as General Manager o'f Cooperative Wholesale to the 20th annual meeting, immed iately previous to which he was stricken. His ability as a business man and his idealism as a cooperator are both revealed in his last report which might well be considered as a message to cooperators generally. A MESSAGE TO COOPERATORS 100 Consumers' Cooperation THE Central Cooperative Wholesale, in passing its 20th milestone in 1937, reached a new high record in sales, name ly, $3,356,550.57, with a $510,809.42 in crease (17.95%) over the previous year.<query> who was the general manager of cooperative wholesale</query> This gratifying showing was made despite the renewed business depression which started early during the latter part of the year. According to available statistics, the average increase o'f wholesale trade in the United States for the year 1937 was \\5%. Higher prices contributed 6.8% to that result; therefore, in general whole saling the actual volume of goods han dled increased on the average by less than 5%. Wholesale food prices went up \.\%; and, considering the fact tihat a large portion of our sales consists of food products, flour and feed, we may safely assume that the tonnage of goods handled by the Central Cooperative Wholesale was about 13% more than during the preceding year. Recent statistics tell us that 1937 retail sales in this country amounted to over 40 billion dollars, and that t'he retailers enjoyed a 6^2% average increase in their volume of business over the year 1936.<query> average increase in wholesale trade in us</query> Our auditors' reports reveal that the co operative stores have done considerably better than the private dealers. Statistical information furnished by the United States Department of Commerce indi cates that nearly 1/3 of every dollar spent in retail establishments in 1937 went for food -and beverages; more than 1/5 for automobiles, auto accessories, and gasoline; about 1/5 for general mer chandise and apparel; and the remainder for other goods sold. Expense Ratios—Earnings In comparison with the year 1936, the ratio of the Central Cooperative Whole sale's operating expenses remained about 'he same, namely 5%, but on account of a slightly higher gross margin, the net in come increased from 1.99% to 2.29%. The census reports show that the ratio of our operating expenses is much lower My, 1938 Extracts from report of H. V. Nurmi, General Manager, to the 20th<query> what was the operating expenses ratio of the central cooperative</query> Annual Meeting of Central Cooperative Wholesale than the average in wholesale business generally. The latest available Depart ment of Commerce census is for t'he year 1935, and it discloses an average operat ing expense of 10.1% for the voluntary group wholesalers, which had an annual turnover of more tihan 578 million dollars in that year. In this particular group, the ratio of operating expenses varied, in ac cordance with the volume of sales, from 8.3% to \\Y2%, for the year in question. The low ratio of operating expenses in our case can be attributed to the efficien cy of operations, as well as to the loyalty of our member associations in purchasing their requirements through their own Wholesale. The net income for the year, $76,- 910.15, represents a 38.4% return on the invested capital. Financial Standing of the Wholesale The net worth of the Wholesale in creased during the year from $262,787.86 to $313,894,89.<query> average operating expenses wholesalers</query> Our Notes and Accounts Receivable as of December 31 were only $641.65 higher than a year ago, although the 1937 sales averaged $42,500 more per month than in 1936. Inventories show but a $2,906.65 increase in comparison witlh the previous year, indicating that a special effort has been made to lower merchandise stocks in the face o'f de clining market prices. The Notes Payable have been reduced by more than $20,000 within the last year, and there were no open Accounts Payable on December 31. (It might be mentioned in this con nection that the greatest portion of our Notes Payable fall in the class of a fixed indebtedness; that is, they are loans from cooperative associations and tiheir indi vidual members.) The ratio of current assets to current liabilities is now 2.7, the current liabilities being $21,241.05 less than a year ago.<query> what is the current balance of accounts payable</query> In the 1937 Annual Meeting a resolu tion was passed, recommending a 5-ipoint financing program for our Wholesale and its member associations. In accord ance with the spirit of that resolution, 101 the board members are now recommend ing that a substantial amount of the 1937 net earnings be placed in the Surplus- Reserve to provide more working capital. The delegates should unanimously en dorse this recommendation pertaining to the financing of our future activities. Al- thouo'h at the end of the year we had a considerable amount of cash on hand, that condition was more or less of a tem porary mature, because almost everyone of our member associations had made an effort to pav their balances in full. The Accounts Receivable are usuallv much liiaher, absorbing .part of the funds need ed for normal operations. In the Manager's report for 1936, it was emphasized that our central organi zations should go more and more into production, a tendency which seems to exist in Europe where the cooperatives have constantly been able to reduce the commodity price level previously set by their competitors.<query> what is the purpose of the surplus reserve</query> Some 5000 young people have at tended Farmers Union Camps since they were made a part of the program in 1934. The camp idea has spread from North Dakota and Montana, which states ini tiated it in 1934, to Wisconsin; Minne sota, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota. The summer camp season now ends with a ten-day session at an All State Camp centrally located. This yea students from six states and visitors fr *' eleven states attended the All-State Ça m which was in the Black Hills of S™ J! Dakota. Uth Training Leaders The Junior program of education can not be carried on without trained leader ship so county training schools for lead ers are conducted. Thus, the educational work is carried into the adult field. The same topics as are taught at the Junior camps are taught in these schools, with the addition of a course upon the annual study topic.<query> where is farmers union camp located</query> If our coooerators cciuld understand the mieaninq of cooper ative production and its importance to all consumers, undoubtedly they would concentrate their efforts on buildinq larger and more adequately financed central organizations. Merchandising and Service Trends At present we carry in our stocks over 3,000 varieties, grades and packs of mer chandise, out of which about 1,200 are handled under the CO-OP label. A total of 79 new items of CO-OP label mer chandise were added during tlhe year, 316 different commodities now being handled under the CO-OP label, and a number of new items will again be listed before the current year is over. In pur chasing goods, strict maintenance of quality has been our aim; several labora tories and chemists have been consulted and engaged to make tests. Comparisons as to quality, taste, appearance, etc., have been conducted periodically by our buy ers in order to sustain high standards of quality for all types of merchandise.<query> what is the co-op label</query> Auditing and Educational Departments Both of these service departments will render detailed reports dealing with their activities. The Auditing Department income in creased from $11,724.55 in 1936 to $16,- 102 424.76, tlhe Department showing a income of $401.75. The Wholesale $1.296.83 in auditing fees, as comparprl with $904.37 in the year 1936. The Education Department has taken care of attending membership and other meetinos in the district, and supervised the fieldwork. Besides, the director of the Educational Department follows the edu cational policies of our cooperative publi cations, and directs the general educa tional activities of the Wholesale. In ad dition, the Educational Department has been in charge of all radio programs and the cooperative training schools which are conducted annually. The Management of the Wholesale :has repeatedly appealed to the member associations to make greater efforts to ex,pand Youth League and Guild activi ties.<query> what is the salary of the auditing department</query> More signs of organized activity have been recently displaved on the nart of the Youth Leagues and Guilds than during the past several years—which, of course, is a hopeful sign, indicating that our cooperators are becoming cognizant of the ta 193§ ture, consumer problems, and so on. Per haps both procedures might be followed. The Minnesota law relating to coop eration in the schools provides only for the expenditure of a limited amount of money to be used to provide ""training and instruction"" on cooperation dn the elementary and secondary schools of the state, and for the preparation and pro vision of ""suitable and necessary out lines and courses of study."" Under this law the Minnesota State Department of Education has issued the first of a series of publications it has planned on the sub ject o'f cooperation. The following para graphs taken from the foreword of that publication express one opinion as to the way in which the subject of cooperation should be incorporated in the school cur riculum: ""Ideally, .the study of consumers' coopera tion should be integrated with the entire school curriculum, and its various (phases should be outlined wherever they logically fit into courses of study in the fields of the social!<query> what is the minnesota law on cooperation</query> sciences and business, home economics and agriculture In this 'way the subject could receive the attention it should have in con nection with subject matter to which it is related. While such integration is educational ly sound, it is unfortunately non-existent. Our present courses of study almost completely ignore the whole topic. Such an omission is probably due primarily to the fact that the syllabi in use in Minnesota schools were prepared over six years ago, and courses of study, lake text books, tend to ilag with regard to new material unfless 'they are in a constant process of revision. ""New courses of study now being con structed will, it is to be hoped, remedy the present deficiency regarding the subject of consumers' cooperation. Meanwhile there is a demand and a need for material which can be .used in the schools until such an integrated presentation is available, and which may then be adapted to the better educational technique."" The Minnesota law thus gives the schools an opportunity to secure material for use in ""training and instruction"" on cooperation, but it does not compel them to use it.<query> what is the purpose of the minnesota law</query> To what extent they will in corporate material on the subject of co operation in the school program remains to be seen. Already teachers and pros pective teachers have occasion to gain some of the background (hat is necessa ry if they are to handle the subject ef fectively. Most of the teachers' colleges 'in the state are planning to give material on cooperation in their courses, and the University of Minnesota offers courses 105 H \ 1 dealing with the subject in its School of Business Administration, its Extension Division, and in its College of Agricul ture. Attempts are being made to offer opportunities for teachers now in service to learn more about the subiject should they feel a need for such assistance. Why Cooperation Should be •Included in School Courses Cooperation as a form of economic or ganization iand a method of doing busi ness should have its place in any course of study which attempts to present a description and explanation of modern social and economic life and its historical •development.<query> why is cooperation important in school</query> It must be included in any Well rounded social studies program simply because it is a part of the social wéb which constitutes modern civiliza tion. In certain areas of this country the cooperative movement is offering to young people increasing opportunities for 'employment, and is therefore of interest from the standpoint of vocational guid ance. The cooperative movement is also of importance because it constitutes one of the methods which is being advanced ras a democratic means of achieving greater economic justice and security. As such, it should be examined carefully and fair ly; 'and its purposes, methods, and ac complishments should be known and un derstood. The purpose, therefore, of the intro duction of the subiject of coqperation into the curriculum is twofold: the provision of an opportunity for the study of a method of business wlhich should receive its share of attention along -with all other methods; and the presentation of facts about a movement concerning which citizens and consumers may be called upon to form an opinion, to the end that students may have sufficient information to draw their own conclusions based on knowledge and understanding rather than on emotion and partisan propa ganda.<query> why is cooperative movement important</query> How Cooperation Should be Taught in the Schools Readers of Consumers' Cooperation are well acquainted with the educational activities carried on by cooperative or ganizations. Cooperative leagues and wholesales in the United States have 106 developed effective programs for tv, education of members, employees and tr^ general public. Their educational &„ gnams lead directly into action. Th try to give the general public information and 'understanding which will result a recognition of the need for, and value of, cooperative enterprise. They attempt to give all their members the knowledge and understanding of cooperative aims and methods which will make them -good cooperators. In addition to these 'pur poses, the education of cooperative em ployees aims at technical efficiency. The function of the school in teaching cooperation is not identical with that of educational activities carried on by coop erative organizations themselves, al though .much of the material presented 'will be similar.<query> what is cooperative education</query> Coopenative institutions definitely aim at convincing people of the 'merits of cooperative enterprise. That is 'what they should do. On the other hand, the public schools should aim only at presenting an honest, fearless, and im partial understanding, accompanied by training in clear thinking, sound reason ing, and the ability to make wise choices and judgments. If the schools can accom plish that aim, they will have performed the greatest possible service to the co operative movement as well as to all other democratic movements. Urgent Needs in the Development of a Sound School Program If cooperation is to be included in the school program on a sound educational basis, there are two very important •factors that must be considered, the ques tion of materials and the problems •of teacher preparation and selection. •Courses of study and text books that •handle the subject intelligently and fairly will need to be developed.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative schools</query> Good supple mentary materials, which are becoming increasingly important in all good teach ing programs must be made available. But even more important than these is •the training ability and understanding of the material which they are to teach, the ability to thinlk for themselves, and an attitude which recognizes the importance of free and fair discussion of social and economic problems, if they are to be et- fective in teaching cooperation or any other phase of modern life. Consumers' Cooperation {•^operation, the Schools aJ1(j Democracy In a 'democratic society the relation ship between cooperation and the schools is one of mutual obligation. I have at tempted to present the obligation of the schools toward cooperation. What is the obligation of the cooperative movement to the schools? Cooperation has always recognized tjie value of education. Its purpose is the achievement of economic democracy.<query> what is the obligation of the cooperative movement to the schools</query> It can survive only in a society in which political democracy is maintained and extended. Our American system of pub lic education is likewise founded on de mocracy. Our educational institutions can carry out their function only if they can be free to assemble and disseminate knowledge and understanding. They can achieve and maintain this freedom only in an atmosphere of political and eco nomic democracy. Furthermore, neither political nor economic democracy can survive without an educational program which gives to all citizens the ability to take part intelligently in democratic ac tion. Both the cooperative movement and education depend on democracy, and de mocracy in turn depends on them. Co- 'operatO'rs who recoornize these factors Will be concerned with the public schools to a far broader extent than merely the •inclusion of cooperation in the school curricula. They will iknow that the wel fare of their movement as well as the success of all forms of democracy are fundamentally dependent on the public schools.<query> what is the role of democracy in education</query> These are examples of the topics chosen: world peace, the coopera tive movement, the machine age, money and credit, and peace and patriotism. Workers Education under W.P.A. has turned to the Farmers Union for help in making up courses and in several states has carried on a rural workers' education program, under supervision of the Farm ers Union. Leadership camps are now sponsored by North Dakota, Montana, and Wis consin organizations where the adult members may meet to study and discuss their work in the cooperative movement and community leadership. The classes in leadership camps are largely discussion classes. Winter institutes from three to four weeks duration are conducted for a group whose ages range between eight een and thirty-five years. Older students are accepted if they are leaders in their community or if they are employed by cooperative business institutions.<query> what is the leadership camp</query> They will consequently work increasingly for the welfare of public education, its extension and its improve ment, and for the maintenance of aca demic freedom. THE BRITISH PAGEANT OF COOPERATION A COLORFUL pageant dramatizing the origin and progress of the con sumers cooperative movement in Great Britain will be the outstanding feature of International Cooperators Day, Julv 2, at Wembley Stadium, England. More than 2,000 persons will ta'ke part in this historical pageant, which is under the direction of the London Cooperative So ciety in association with the South Sub urban and Watford Societies. In addi tion to the eight episodes which portray the spirit and growth of the cooperative movement there will be many added fea tures such as folk dancing by 1,000 trained members of the children's circles, mass displays by the Woodcraft Folk, and community singing. This is the most ambitious dramatic presentation ever organized by British cooperators and judging from the scena rio promises to be a thrilling enactment °f cooperative development.<query> what is the british pageant of cooperatives</query> It is impos sible for us to present the entire scenario °f the pageant in this limited space but we shall outline the main action of the Paoeant and quote from various episodes. The pageant qpens with a fanfare Wowcn by four mounted trumpeters fol- Ellen Edwards lowed by the voice of the Commentator: ""We present to you here the Pageant of man and his will to cure the disease of his society and the darkness of his mind. It is the pageant of his will to put an end to the so-called Competition that throws a shadow of war and the profit-making that ends in slavery. We shall begin with that Merrie England which is partly the invention of storytellers and partly the memory of a little country \tfhere eight million men and women and children lived on a rich wheat growing soil. That was before they were driven from field and cabbage patch to the place that had been prepared for them, the Institution, the Workhouse, the Bastille, driven by flaming swords from Merrie England."" The first episode deals with this Mer rie England.<query> what is the main theme of the pageant</query> The stage is flooded with a crowd of agricultural workers, streams of children running in around the may poles, led O'n by the Morris Dancers. This gay pastoral scene is disrupted in the next episode by the coming of the Machines—a rhythmical procession of unsigthly figures, iron clad and stiffly jointed, accompanied by harsh, blatant music. The people are at first bewildered but as they are surrounded more and more by the machines, they are urged to revolt, and they turn on the machines to 107 destroy them. Two large dummies repre senting Capitalism have -been silently watching the conquest of the people by the machines and the revolt of the people against the machines. As the destruction reaches its height, the Capitalists speak: ""In the name o!f the King, Shoot! In the name of the King! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!"" The people disperse.<query> what is the machine in the movie</query> The stage is left bare and during the interlude can be heard the chorus, representing the voice of the people, chanting: ""Men of England, heirs of glory, heroes of un written story Nurslings of one mighty mother, Hopes of her and one another. Rise like lions after slumber in unconquerable number, Shake your chains to earth like dew which in sleep has failed on you. Ye are many—they are few."" The Commentator then speaks: ""These were troubled times. The men of Eng land asked for bread and were given new restrictive laws. The men of England asked for bread and were given bullets. And men asked, Why? Why? Why? Stormy voices answered. But not clearly."" Three of the voices which try to an swer the people are Tom Paine, William Good'win and William Corbett.<query> who is the voice of the people in kings of england</query> Episode three begins with the introduc tion of Robert Owen by the Commenta tor. Owen speaks to the people. ""There are many causes of your evils. They are—the governments of the world, under every form and naime. The practice of buying and selling for a moneyed profit. The prac tices which produce contests, civil and mili tary, individual and national. The present practice of forming the character of man. The strong opposing the weak."" This is followed by the dramatization of Owen's mill and school at New Lan ark, ending with the destruction of all Robert Owen's good work. The fourth episode describes the very beginning of the Cooperative Move ment. This is very effectively done by the twenty-eight Roclbdale weavers them selves telling the audience of their early difficulties, their trials and their hopes. Howarth speaks: ""We opened on Saturday and Monday nights at first.<query> what episode of the show is robert owen in</query> That was all. And that shop in Toad Lane, Rochdale, grew till there were 14,000 members doing a trade of $15,000,000, owning 108 shops and workshops, a library and read' rooms. And it became a movement th^ spread into every corner of the kingdom Episode five is the dramatization of the spread of the ""News olf the 'tin-ticket' —news of Rochdale."" The groups in the procession which marches round the arena are costumed according to their period from 1894 to 1914, their size cor responding to the number of the mem bers of the movement at that time. The procession is interrupted by WAR and the sltage literally becomes a battle ground. The dance of the soldiers and people form the sixth episode. As the \var dancers leave the stage a group of mourning women, sad and resigned dressed in grey dresses and black cloaks mount the steps and dance to a monot onous drum and wailing song to form the seventh episode.<query> what episode is news of rochdale</query> * * * The Commentator opens the final epi sode with: ""The war is over—but for how long? The war is over—but terror menaces. The war is over—but civilization has started down the steep slope. Can it be saved half way? We have reaped the harvest of the dragon's teeth ... In Britain 7,500,000 men and women are customers in the world's biggest business. They stand for democracy. They stand for freedom. They stand for justice. They stand for peace. Who stands with them? Who stands with them?"" The International Cooperative Pro cession enters, a procession of contin gents representing the various coun tries where there are Cooperative So cieties. At its head stride forty strong men in white overalls and scarlet shirts. They leap on the stage, take the black cloaks from the mourning women and give each one a brilliant shawl.<query> who stands with them</query> Men and women dance triumpihantly while the Procession marches round the outside of the arena. When all the countries have entered they assemble round the stage in a vast tableaux of national costumes and 'flags. As the band strikes up all sing ""'Men Awake."" The two figures ot Democracy and Peace drawn in cars by 'hundreds of children, take the center ot the stage. ""The children open their bas kets, and a dense white cloud of pigeons with wings fluttering rises up and dis perses to all parts of Great Britain carry ing messages of greeting to other coop- erators.""

What is more, he has put it into a delightful story form which is easy to read and yet is bristling with deep truths and supported by actual facts and figures. The leaders of Nova Scotia are carrying out an experiment surpassed nowhere in the world today. It is so unique that the Pope in far away Rome has recognized it and has sent a personal letter of commendation. Leaders from all over the continent of every race and creed are going there to see and learn at the feet of these present day prophets — simple men, yet of greatest vision and power of action. What are these men doing? First. They are educating and remaking peo ple, ""They proved, most important of all, that the people hunger and thirst for real education that is linked posi tively with the life they live and the problems they face in its daily round.<query> what is the significance of the nova scotia movement</query> But, remember, this is education, real and alive, and not the ineffectual coun terpart that the institutions of higher education have tried to palm off as adult education in the shape of insipid and perfunctory little courses in busi ness English and appreciation of the arts,"" They believe in people.

Fifth. They are working toward a wider, total program, not just Consumer Coopera tion. ""In every problem they take up for discussion they are thinking in terms of new communities.""

America Goes to War, by Charles Callan Tansill, Little Brown 6 Co., 1938; 730 pages $5.00. This volume is a study of the causes which led America into the world war. It is based upon ex tensive research into the documents of the war. Many private papers have been consulted which have not been used in other studies. The author has apparently been impartial in his research. People who approved of Mr. Wilson's war will find sad disillusionment in his book. The value of this work is that it shows what may happen to us again in the near future, and how. The reader who understands cooperation can peruse this book and see on every page how the cooperative method of social and economic or ganization would have obviated the terrible mis takes which are inherent in the prevalent war making methods of supply and distribution of economic needs.<query> who is the author of america goes to war</query> J.

Warbasse Nationalism and Culture, by Rudolf Rocker, Co- vici Friede, 1937; 575 pages $3.50 This book is an excellent introduction to the study of anarchistic philosophy which is essen tial to the understanding of consumers' cooper ation. It discusses the will to power, the nature of coercive forces which dominate the state, the qualities of freedom, and the essentials of cul ture. The author says: ""All politics has its roots in the religious concepts of men, while things of cultural nature are economic and consequently in the most intimate relationship with the value- creating forces of social life; so that we are plain ly compelled to speak of an inherent opposition between religion and culture."" Understanding of anarchist philosophy is a prerequisite to understanding of the nature of the state. And no one fathoms the meaning of con sumers' cooperation who is not equipped with a comprehension of the .principles of anarchistic libertarianism because consumers' cooperation is essentially anarchistic.<query> what is the anarchist theory</query> This book shows how our modern economic system has dulled the social feeling of the individual and hindered his free development. And it is just this hindrance that militates against the advancement of coopera tion. J. P. Warbasse The Best of Art Young, The Vanguard Press, New York, $3.00.

Some like best his cartoon showing a wizened tenement house boy and girl, lookinq up at the stars and saying, ""Look at de stars -I tnick as bedbugs."" Others feel themselves a part oi his cartoon, ""This World of Creepers,"" show ing humanity crawling along with a wave of fear above them. Art Young is admitted to be the best of American cartoonists and these are a se lection of his best. Then from cartoons, you can turn in ""Land of The Free"" to actual [pictures of the kind of hell some of the American people live in and the effect on these people who live in economic hell.<query> who is art young</query> Here you can take your choice between looking at the worn out share-cropper, the tenant, the migrant, the unemployed, the worker being slugged and shot, the tents and tenements they live in, and the danger and dust bowls they work in. MacLeish's sound-track poem sometimes with only a few words on each page as ""We don't know"" and ""We're wondering,"" increases your tension as you turn the pages. ""They Starve That We Might Eat"" may make the food choke in your throat too, as it did the missionary worker, whose life among the migrants is described. The sad thing is that such powerfully des tructive literature does not also present the con structive cooperative way out to ""Economic Heaven on Earth.""

When we raised the question in each of the seven countries we visited in Europe last Fall relative to their classification of the Consumers Cooperative Movement, all of the leaders included vocational goods along with household goods as a part of the general Consumers' Cooperative Movement. However, we did not find"" any place where they had printed a pamphlet on the subject except in Sweden. This pamphlet is the result of principles laid down by the Congress of Kooperativa Forbundet in 1924. These principles were elaborated by Mr. G. R. Holmberg, who until a year ago was head of the Grocery Department and a Director ot KoQperativa Forbundet, in which capacity he had occasion to consider carefully the question ot consumer and producer relationships. He 'has now become the head of the Swedish Slaughtery As sociation. Consumers' Cooperation -j^e original pamphlet was naturally in Swe- j.jj, When we asked the Research Secretary of jL Organization Department, to translate the Pfst two sub-titles, he did so in these words, ""The Farmer Farmer as Household Consumer"" and ""The as Vocational Consumer."" In the discus- ion of tne subject, he also drew on a sheet of aper an organizational chart showing the eco nomic interests of farmers, workers and profes sionals as they interpreted them in Sweden, which chart is reproduced on the inside of the back cover of the pamphlet.<query> who was the leader of the consumer cooperative movement</query> The Swedes interpret farmers as having a dual consumer or buyer in terest — namely, as a consumer of household qoods and as a consumer of vocational goods, which are supplied by the general and special Consumers' Cooperatives. After translating the original pamphlet, the of ficials of Kooperativa Forbundet kindly offered to add to it up-to-date information covering the manner in which they have proceeded to develop [heir consumer and producer organizations in that country on the basis of the principles laid down, and the latter part of the pamphlet accordingly covers the agreements which have been made be tween consumer and producer groups.

This is the first document of its kind we have ever had the great pleasure of reading. After a general introduction describing our present ""mixed"" economic system and the crisis we are in, Dr. Landis, who has become well known as one of America's best writers on the Consumers' Coop erative Movement, discusses in condensed and clear form the concrete and related programs of what we believe to be the six major forms of economic organizations which are developing the new ""cooperative economic society."" These six programs are Credit Unions, Consumers' Coop eratives, Marketing Cooperatives, i^abor Unions, Social Insurances and Public Ownership. Dr. Landis might well have added that they have three common characteristics: they are all non-profit organizations, they are all democrat ically controlled, and they are all owned by the people generally, insofar as ownership is in volved.<query> who is dr. landis</query> Other njts will be developed for use later.

COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH Virginia, Minn. — Cooperative lead ers from four states and hundreds of friends and business associates gathered here last month to honor H. V. Nurmi, general manager of Central Coopera tive Wholesale who died in Superior, May 26. Mr. Nurmi ihad beeen associat ed with C. C.

The number of co-op store members Mpled during the year; business was up °6% for 1937 over that of 1936 and the first three months of the current year July, 1938 showed an added increase of 46% over- the same period in 1937. Since the end of 1936 the fully paid membership of E.C.W. has increased from 14 societies to 68. An additional 29 have part paid memberships in the wholesale and one •hundred more cooperative stores and buying clubs are buying through E.C.W.

The fact is that, unconsciously to most Americans, we have largely passed from a state of free competition to monopoly control of prices to con sumers and pay to producers. For fifty years we have ideceived ourselves by biindly attempting to control the growing monopoly menace by political regulation.

COOPERATIVES NEED KNOWLEDGE I I AND CAPITAL (An address delivered over the Columbia broad casting system, Monday evening, July 11.)<query> what is the purpose of cooperative movement</query> IN the Swedish consumers cooperative movement we ihave learned 'that there are two absolutely essential factors for the successful operation of the consumers' own economic enterprises, namely, knowledge and capital. In consumer co operative enterprises it is necessary that the members have some economic knowledge and that everybody contrib utes toward the common capital. In Sweden every citizen can become a member irrespective of occupation, re ligion, or political affiliations. Politically the Swedish cooperative movement is ab solutely neutral. The common purpose for all members of the consumer cooperative movement is to lower the cost of living, or, in other words, to raise the standard of living. This means to get more of the good things of life. But to do this the members must have economic knowledge and the necessary capital to operate their cooperative business. It is necessary for the members to study to get the knowl edge, and it is also necessary that they learn to save systematically.<query> what is the purpose of the consumer cooperative movement</query> A Living Ideal Class meetings for these young people in rural areas often offer their major so cial contact. They assist with the pro grams put on by their locals, and take part in county and state conventions. They feel themselves and they are, an active part of their organization. Their cooperatives represent a living ideal to them. A circulating library composed of books which are too costly for most in dividuals to buy is maintained by the Education Service for use of the mem bership in the states surrounding it. A monthly program service is also pre pared by the various State Directors and sent in printed form to locals in many states. This monthly program is an aid to local leaders who have had no train ing in preparing entertainment. It is also a source of material to people who have, very often, no other place from which to obtain material.<query> what is the living ideal</query> In Sweden we realized quite early that in order to operate successfully it was not enough 'for members to buy shares to start the cooperative but that ability to manage the business was just as neces sary. Education of Members is the Foundation. The real strength of a cooperative so ciety cannot be measured by the size of the capital; it lies in the ability of the members to manage their own private finances and the business of the coopera tive. The capital increases when man aged by able members. After some bitter experiences we learned this fact in 'Swe den. That is why education in economic subjects is one of the most important activities of the Swedish cooperative movement. We organize our members in study circles, we supply correspondence 114 Albm Johansson, Presid of Kooperativa F Stockholm, courses, we have a college for trainina employees and directors.<query> what is the importance of education in the cooperative movement</query> The coopp tive movement publishes a weekly man3"" zine which has the largest circulation in Sweden. We also are the largest pub. lishers of economic literature. Members Must Buy for Cash It was first necessary to interest the members in putting their own financial affairs in order; for without the founda tion of a sound family budgeting, coop erative enterprise cannot gain the nec essary strength. In other words, the members should not go in ,debt and should not spend their income before it is earned The members should buy for cash. To ac complish this the Cooperative Movement for many years conducted an intense ed ucational campaign to do away with cred it business, so that today practically all cooperative business is on a cash basis. This halbit has also become the rule among a great many other consumers. As a result of cash trading we have now a very solid ground for consumer coop erative activities.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> But it has not been easy for consumers to break away from cen tury-old habits of buying on credit and it has required strength of character to stick to the habit of buying for cash. But Swedish families have 'demonstrated that they possess this strength of character. Retail Cooperatives Must Also Buy For Cash The Cooperatives in Sweden follow the same program as their members; they also buy for cash. Cooperatives as well as members pay spot cash. The rule is this: Cooperatives in Sweden do not bor row money from the banks or the gov ernment and do not buy goods on credit. They operate entirely on the capital that the members have supplied. Consequent ly many societies at the start concentrated on only one commodity. The members paid the regular retail price and the pro.- its were credited to the members in pro portion to their purchases.<query> what is the swedish rule for buying for cash</query> In this way Consumers' Cooperatio« he capital was built up and the cooper ative was enabled to expand its activities other commodities under the efficient control of the management. Through this gradual development a full-fledged co operative society has thus been created. jt has also happened in certain cases that organized consumers purchased a private retail business and transformed it into a cooperative society. Cooperative Wholesaling and Manufacturing The retail cooperatives are in .Sweden federated into a central organization, Kooperativa Forbundet. We call it K. p. K. F. functions as a wholesale, and in addition carries on extensive educational activities among the members and the management. Furthermore K. F. owns a number of big factories in different lines such as margarine, flour, macaroni, bread, shoes, overshoes, automobile tires, veg etable oils, electric lamp bulbs, and so forth.<query> what is the role of cooperative societies</query> Cooperatives Bust the Trusts As a general rule our cooperative facj lories have been established in order to protect our members from the price- pegging policies practiced by monopolies. For in Sweden as in many other coun tries, private monopolies have been wide spread, organized wholly for private gain and without consideration of the inter ests of the consuming public. Thanks to the manufacturing activities of K. F. an efficient check against monopoly prices has been put in the hands of the con sumers. The consumers cooperatives tell monopolies what is a just price. They act as a yardstick for private business. We have no anti-trust law in Sweden; we only have a law for the government to study monopolies. The power of K. F. is based on the accumulated capital of the local societies and ultimately on the sound finances of the members. The effect of this control is felt not only in those fields where K. F. operates its factories but also in other lines of consumers' goods, for private manufacturers know that if they try to peg prices at unreasonable levels K. F. both can and will start a fflanufacturing this line.<query> why are cooperatives necessary</query> An example will illustrate this: When I left Sweden a few weeks ago, I was informed that the lin oleum monopoly, which comprises practi- , 1938 cal'ly all factories in this field, had decided to reduce its prices in Sweden by 15 per cent. This was done because K. F. had made it 'known that if the monoply did not reduce prices, K. F. was ready to build its own linoleum factory. The Swedish consumers will save nearly one million dollars yearly on their purchases- of linoleum alone. With this saving the consumers can now buy other necessities, thereby putting more people to work and speeding up economic activities all a- round, including those also of the private- retailers! Linoleum is not a big article in Sweden. Nevertheless we have seert what effect reduction in price has upon increased consumption. When K. F. started production of electric lamp bulbs in order to force the European lamp monopoly to reduce its prices, the result was that the Swedish people made an annual saving on this ar ticle of about two million dollars.<query> why did linoleum monopoly reduce prices</query> It meant that the standard of living was raised,- and that more workers were employed. The examples could be multiplied; they serve to illustrate the general effect of K. F.'s activities in lowering the prices of food and goods in Sweden and also increasing employment. But lowering prices does not lower wages. Practically all employees in Sweden are organized in labor unions. Wages are regulated by friendly agreement between employers and employees. If the parties cannot a- gree, an arbitrator appointed by the gov ernment must intervene. Monopoly prices cause unemployment and poverty. That is why the Swedish cooperative movement organizes to break the power of monopolies. ""Everyone wonders why Sweden is now so very prosperous. I think it is largely due to stabilization by the Co operative stores and factories and their education of the people. ""I do not merely think the Coopera tive system will come to America—it must come."" Albin Johansson, President of Kooperativa Forbundet of Sweden Washington Sunday Star July 3, 1938 115 OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY— NOT FOR COOPERATORS E R. WHEN we join together as members of cooperatives, we commit our selves before the world to the acceptance of the basic principle o'f a non-profit eco nomic system — of not being willing to take ""Other People's Money"" from them, in any manner whatsoever, for our own benefit and their injury, as well as to the reverse of the same principle of not being willing that ""Other People"" take from us ""Money"" that rightly belongs to our selves.<query> why did the swedish cooperative movement organize to break the power of monopolies ""Other People's Money"" is not for Cooperators. Cooperators' money is not for ""Other People."" This basic prin ciple has three major applications. Cooperators do not want to take ""Other People's Money"" as profits. Co- operators not only reject illegal methods •of acquiring ""Other People's Money"" but they likewise reject legal methods as well. Cooperators would not reach into other people's pockets as individuals and take their money from them by illegal stealth or force. However, cooperators are also committed to the 'far higher principle ot not reaching into other people's pockets as members of society and taking their money from them by any legal method of making private-profits. Cooperators should not take ""Other People's Money"" as credits. Cooperators reject credit from cooperative associa tions. Members of cooperatives refuse to use other members' money for their bene fit in the form of credit for commodity purchases.<query> why is cooperator a good idea</query> Cooperators will not eventually take ""Other People's Money"" as loans. Coop erators will eventually pool their money and build up a financially impregnable organization — without relying on ""Oth er People's Money"" for loans. As the Swedes say, ""a cooperative should neith er give nor accept credit."" The primary purpose of a cooperative should be to build up a ifinancially im pregnable pool of its own funds and its members' money, and then to use this financial power to control the .general price and pay levels of the -country ap a •whole so as to narrow the spread beween 116 consumers' prices and producers' pay fo only such an amount as will cover the cost of distribution arid provide the nec essary reserve funds for reasonable ex- pansion. We will discuss the working out of such a financial program for coopera tives under twelve subdivisions.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative</query> L Open Books Secrecy is eliminated in a cooperative. The detailed financial statements are open to all members. This produces two very definite results: first, it results in the members having ""confidence"" in their as sociation since they know where their own money is and goes; second, it results in the ""honesty"" of employees, since they know that they are handling their own and their fellow-members' money. Defal cations among cooperative employees are far less than in private-iprofit business, which is proven by the lower net bonding rate. Since speculation in either stocks or commodities is eliminated as a rule in a cooperative, the inducement to employees to appropriate funds for individual use or speculation is absent. Coonerative em ployees are taught not to speculate, while private-profit employees are taught, to speculate by the operations of the busi ness.<query> why is secrecy eliminated in a cooperative</query> A well-planned and executed program goes far toward getting new persons interested in the work being done by cooperatives in a given territory. The Farmers Union Central Exchange has found that its operating costs are cut because its educational work is carried on by the membership of the Farmers Union locals—a labor of love, performed gratis, and all the more effective because of it. WHY CHURCH PEOPLE TAKE TO CO-OPS Sylvanus M. Duvall, Associate Professor of Economics, George Williams College I HE almost pathetic eagerness with which many church people, and es pecially leaders, have welcomed cooper ation to their collective bosoms, merits an understanding which it has usually not received. The rash of articles on coopéra tion with which religious journals have suddenly broken out has described the movement and discussed its supposed """"»its and limitations. Of greater signifi-<query> why do church people take to cooperatives</query> The use of ""Other People's Money"" for personal profit was described by a former president of the New York Stock Exchange as ""a rule in the street"" by brokers to whom funds are entrusted. Cooperative employees are encouraged not to emulate such men as the Insulls in utilities, Van Sweringens in railroads, Mitchells in banking and Whitneys in stocks, who are the natural fruit of the private^profit system. II. Accurate Auditing The financial statements of a cooper ative must be accurate. Auditors are sometimes presumed to be infallible, but while generally accurate, they are not al ways so. Their work should be constant ly scrutinized by the manager, directors and members. The writer has personal ly known of two major mistakes made by Consumers' Coopération s nationally recognized auditing firm, the first of which resulted in an error of $100,000 and the second of $250,000, with serious after-effects upon the com pany which 'was inaccurately audited.<query> why are financial statements of cooperatives inaccurate</query> Some auditors' statements of coopera tives are not as complete as they could be with detailed percentages and com parisons. Cooperative statements should be largely self-explanatory. It has been truly said that percentages are to busi ness what kilowatts are to electricity and inches to measurement. It is only by per centages that there can be a clear under standing of financial statements and that wise conclusions can be drawn for future action. I have recently seen an auditor's statement of a retail cooperative which, to me, was pitiful. The manager was a likely looking young man. Yet the auditor had not helped him iby figuring out per centages and comparisons so that he could tell his gross margin or ihis per centages of expense in order to determine just why he had lost money for the year although he had made money the year before, or what to do about it for the future.<query> what is the difference between a percentage and a percentage</query> III. Balance Sheet and Operating Statement Cooperative auditors must be far su perior to private-profit auditors. Coop erative auditors must be interpreters of figures as well. They must teach the man ager, directors and members to under stand their balance sheet and operating statements. Both the manager and the directors should study simple statistics until they can read and understand the figures in financial statements as readily as words in a book. Cooperative audi tors, managers and «° directors must then Uly and clearly present ithe statistics 3°° to the members in detail, both in spo ken words and in ^ * Print, so that every one will learn 'how 'o handle his own money as a member °f a cooperative as sociation. IV. Correct Budgets It is as necessary that correct financial* budgets for the future be made as it is that the reports of the past operations be accurate.<query> what is the role of a cooperative auditor</query> Every manager and director should have before him at the end of each month a statement showing the re sults of the month and year to date com pared with two other sets of figures, by amounts and percentages. These two. comparative figures are the actual results of the same periods of the year previous and the anticipated results as set up in the budget for the current year. New cooperatives need to set up correct budg ets to prevent their development being; hampered by starting with too high rents and wages and too low volumes and margins, with the discouragements which follow initial losses. To prepare correct budcjets tor the fu ture it is vitally necessary fhat the audi tor, manager and directors have ah un derstanding of the general facts about the economic system as a whole. In June 1937 the national magazine, Consumers' Cooperation, published a chart showing commodity and common stock prices for twentyJive years and predicted the pres ent depression.<query> why do cooperatives need to set up correct budgets</query> The article advised co operatives to reduce inventories, collect receivables and build up surpluses. This was based upon the study of commodity and common stock price lines before and after the two previous depressions of 1920 and 1929. The compilation and fol lowing of such general statistics relative to the economic system as a whole is the necessary foundation underneath the successful steering of cooperative ships, whether small or large. Only recently we saw a budget com- COMMODITIES AND COMMON STOCKS 10° A'* ___ COMMODITIES— W«ren »d Peirson Commodity Price Index A —— .

It called lor an increase of 25% in volume. When we asked the price of livestock and grain as compared with the previous year the answer was that they were about 25% less. Yet a ""budget was set up calling for a 25% increase, in the face of a 25% re duced buying power among the members. No such budget would have been prepared by the manager or adopted by the directors had they been studying the statistics showing the whole economic situation. Not to study general statistics and set up correct budgets and constantly com pare actual results with the budget is to •gamble with ""Members' Money"" entrust ed to the directors and manager.<query> when did sweden go cash</query> V. Cash Terms There is no equivalent for cash, even though an old statement refers to ""cash or its equivalent."" Cash is cash. Cash over the counter on delivery, or better -still, cash deposits in advance of delivery. ' Cooperation means C.O.D. or C.I.A. A cooperative manager says that giv ing credit is simply opening the cash drawer and saying to a member, ""Take what you like of 'Other People's Mon ey.' We have already quoted the 118 Swedes' famous slogan, ""A c operative should neither g,ve nor accept credit."" Wihat hap pened when the Swedes de cided at their congress in 1920 to ""pay on the nail for all their purchases"" and to ""limit the scope of the movement to the dimension which its own capi tal permitted"" is shown by the chart.<query> what is the difference between cash and cooperative</query> Until then debts had been increasing faster than capital: from then on debts de clined and capital increased while volume continued to rise. Few realize the enormous cost of credit. A bulletin pub lished by Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., is authority for the chart showing the cost of credit in various lines of prod ucts. If credit is needed by a member it should be gotten through a cooperative credit institution and not through a commodity coopera tive. No .manager should be expected to be capable of running both a business and a bank. If a cooperative is to become financial ly impregnable and capable of control ling the general price level it cannot be dependent upon bank loans. Otherwise it is not free from outside control. How could the Swedes have busted trusts if they had tried to use money gotten from bank loans to do it?<query> cost of credit</query> Their hands would have been tied at once. The 1929 and 1937 depressions were plainly the result of building business on the false foundation of credit. The chart illustrates this fact. After 1920 a false foundation for production was laid in foreign loans. When bondholders began to lose confidence and production de clined in 1924 it was again stimulated by a second false foundation of installment credit. Finally a peak was reached, as always occurs when ""Confidence"" in be ing able to unload on the other fellow broke down in Wall Street (which is the only kind of ""Confidence"" there really is in private-profit business), and the crash came. The same false foundation of credit built up the increased production from 1932 to 1937, except that domestic Consumers' Cooperation government credit replaced foreign credit allcl installment credit was even greater, finally the sand foundation of credit nave way again as it always will.<query> when did the depression happen</query> We j,ad learned nothing from 1929. True confidence is built on customers and permanent customers are built on cash. Credit trading is only the private profit substitute for the equitable distri bution of purchasing-power. It has no place in the cooperative movement. The Rochdale Pioneers were right that ""cred it is the invention of the devil of profit."" When the cooperative .movement grows strong enough to bring about the equit able distribution of cash purchasing pow er to all, then credit will be entirely elim inated from business. VI. Patronage Returns No patronage returns should be paid to members out of profits on non-member business or on the business of members who fail to turn in their sales slips. Oth erwise a cooperative becomes in part a profit making business. Patronage returns should not be paid out of ""Other People's Money"" that is borrowed.<query> what is the purpose of credit trading</query> ^ce. to the Church, is an appreciation °' the nature of the pent-up pressure of social idealism which has for so long awaited a suitable channel for expression, Consumers' Cooperation January; and the possibilities of cooperation of adequately furnishing such an outlet, Christianity and Economics The discovery of the social implications of Christianity opened up for many a whole new area of religious living and belief which was entrancing. Economic motives and practices seemed to explain much of the lack of progress in the world, and the apparent inability of the Church to function more effectively in the solu tion of human problems. The Kingdom of God, conceived in social terms, gave to 9 religious activities a meaning and a goal which did much to inspire both confi dence and consecrated effort. The first joyous response consisted mainly in preaching the ""social gospel"" and passing resolutions.<query> what was the social implications of christianity</query> They should be paid only if cash on hand exceeds current liabilities. The reverse of this statement is that capital and any secured loans should be sufficient to cover all fixed assets, in ventories and any receivables. VII. Profits be used for the advancement of the Co operative Movement and can never be distributed to members. VIII. Ample Reserves The question of reserves is largely a question of members' understanding the superiority of a long-itime vs a short- time policy. When members are more in terested in building a new non-profit world for themselves and their children than they are for their own immediate benefit, they will vote larger amounts to reserves and lesser amounts to patronage returns. I venture to suggest that if we were all committed to cooperation to the greatest degree we would vote all of the savings to reserves rather than any fo patronage returns.<query> why are reserves important</query> If everyone saw in their imaginations the rapid growth of monopolies as clearly as some do we would sacrifice the small returns of the present for the far greater returns of the future, so that monopolies can be check mated and Cooperation become domi nant. It should be added that reserves must be actively used and not allowed to lie dormant. They are built up for the sole purpose of more rapidly advancing the growth of the Cooperative Movement. If not actively used for expansion, the result may be that employees will eventu ally feel that they have been robbed and will demand excessive pay. Few cooperatives can help but make some profit. Some trade is transient and some members do not turn in all their pur chase slips. At the close of a period the total sales slips turned in will be less than the total sales.<query> why are cooperative reserves built up</query> Then comes the moral question as to what to do with the profits on the balance of the business. One of our large cooperatives has shown the way to tändle them and be a true cooperative. They nave inserted in their by-laws a provision 'hat all profits must August, 1938 THE COST OF STORE CREDIT O 5 1O 15 20 Grocery—general Repair garages Hardware Gas and oil Farm supply Average, all stores Feed Implement Automobile sales Cattle dealers Usual bank rate 119 IX. Social Capital When one of the members of the Pres ident's Inquiry on Cooperative Enter-« prise in Europe reported as to his obser vations, he stated that the thing which impressed him most was the building up of interestjfree social capital. There is a growing tendency in the same direction in America. One large cooperative has built up its entire capital of nearly two million dollars on the socially-owned, in terest-free basis.<query> what is the average bank rate for a store</query> Another of our largest cooperatives follows the policy of writ ing down to $1 its investments in land, buildings and equipment. X. Increased Investments We must strengthen our present retail and wholesale cooperatives by the pur chase of additional shares of stock. We are not now even building on a shoe string in some cases, we are hanging on a thread. We have, in too many cases, thought we could finance a retail cooperative on 25c to $1 deposits and accumulate the necessary balance out of savings. But someone must put up the money for the stock you draw on for your purchases and for the operating funds. If you do not do so, you are depending upon ""Oth er People's Money,"" which you have no moral right to do. Each member should pay in cash for enough shares in starting a new cooperative to supply his pro portion of the necessary capital.<query> how much money do retail cooperatives need</query> Then each member should invest in additional shares as the business grows and more complete inventories are carried and nev/ lines added. Cooperative members must also think beyond the financing of their retail coop eratives with their own money, and in vest additional funds in order that their retail cooperatives may adequately fi nance their wholesale and, in turn, their wholesale likewise have ample funds to finance factories for production. The new independent study of the Cooperative, Movement entitled ""Consumers' Coop eration in Great Britain"" indicates, for example, in groceries, a possible average savings of about 4% in retailing and eventually about the same percentage in wholesaling. Much greater savings are possible in production. In a conversa tion with Mr. Lancaster, Secretary of the 120 C. W. S. of Great Britain, relative to cooperative savings, he stated after read ing off the figures, ""Production is th"" life blood of the Cooperative Move ment."" Neither retail, wholesale nor manufac turing cooperatives should have to de pend on ""Other People's Money"" in tne form of either bank or personal loans.<query> what is the average savings of a retail cooperative</query> Cooperators should finance their coop eratives adequately with their own mon ey by investing in the necessary shares to do so. We must build the Cooperative Movement faster to escape poverty, un employment and tenancy and to prevent the further development of Monopolism into Fascism in America. XL Pooling Funds Open books, accurate auditing, a thorough understanding of balance sheets and operating statements, correct budgets, cash terms, no profiteering on non-member business, ample reserves, social capital and increased investments will build confidence in the membership of a cooperative until they are willing to take the final anid most important step of pooling their funds. They will not only reach the place where they will refuse to take ""Other People's Money"" but they will have developed sufficient confidence in their ability to handle their own money cooperatively. They will then do two important things: First, retail cooperatives will have de veloped such a confidence in their own wholesale that they will deposit their re ceipts each day in a joint account with the wholesale.<query> why is it important to build a cooperative</query> In Sweden on the first day of the fiscal year, the books of each retail show an asset amount of cash de posited with the wholesale rather than a debit amount of accounts payable to the wholesale. Then each day throughout the year, on the wholesale books, the a- mounts purchased from the wholesale are entered as charges and the amounts de posited to the joint account are entered as credits, and at the close of the day. there appears another credit balance which includes the transactions of the day. In this way all the retail and the wholesale cash balances are pooled into one gigantic fund. . The second important thing which will take place when cooperators gain con fidence in their ability to handle their money cooperatively is that mem- will have developed such a confi dence in their retail and their wholesale that they will deposit their individual savings with their retail to be passed on to and handled by their finance division of their wholesale.<query> what is the difference between retail and wholesale</query> While there cannot help but be some element of risk in the early stages of a cooperative, the follow ing out of the foregoing rules should make every cooperative permanently sound and members' investments and de posits secure. (It might be well here to refer to Denmark, where confidence in cooperatives is demonstrated by each member accepting individual responsibil ity for the debts of the society.) When the money of cooperators, whether individual or retail or whole sale, is all pooled in one mighty fund, it will be powerful enough to bend down any price level that is too high and raise any pay level that is too low and bring monopolies to their knees. The final re sult will be the distribution of purchasing power equitably CREDIT among all the people until pover ty and riches, depressions and 12° booms, unemployed poor and idle rich will be no more on earth.<query> what is the result of a cooperative</query> -|ls XII. Price Policy While it is necessary to first follow the original Rochdale principle of selling at the prevail ing price level, the building of such a financially powerful co operative as we have described will eventually result in being able to adopt an active instead of a passive price policy. This means that a cooperative will set its own prices and private busi ness will have to follow. Sweden is now generally following an active price policy. The head of the bank of Finland says that the cooperatives control the price le vel in that country. In America the most notable success of the cooperatives in controlling the price level is in fertilizer, which is below pre-war level, while other products generally are above pre-war level. The report of the Federal Trade Commis sion gave the cooperative move ment credit for this reduction in fertilizer prices.<query> what is the price policy of a cooperative</query> At Cloquet, Minnesota, where the first cooperative store in the United States to do a million dollar a year business is located, the president has stated that the cooperative sets the price level in the county. Such a policy of lowering the general price level benefits all the people as well as the cooperative members. It may seem altruistic to do this but it is not. As the Swedes say, the people find out what is responsible for the elimination of pov erty, unemployment and tenancy and as they learn they join the cooperative. The time when such an active price policy can be adopted will be determined by the rapidity with whiclh we follow out the policies enumerated in the foregoing and thus build for ourselves a financially powerful cooperative by using our own money cooperatively and refusing to de pend upon ""Other People's Money."" -FOUNDATION OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN U.S.A. 110 95 1920 1Ç25 1930 193Î Consumers' Cooperation J August, 1938 121 SWEDEN PAYS US A VISIT New York — Two of the world's greatest cooperators, Albin Johansson and Axel Gjores, president and secretary of Kooperativa Forbundet, the coopera tive wholesale and union of Sweden, spent a scant three weeks in the United States, June 26 to July 14, as delegates to the Tercentenary Celebration of the Founding of The New Sweden.<query> when was the first cooperative established</query> We students used to sweep down upon conventions with carefully prepared resolutions de manding changed economic practices, the abolition of the profit motive and what not, in the name of the Christian ideal. We had fun in those days: just as the small boys in and around Boston in 1775 had fun snowballing the British soldiers. And like them, we were terribly in earnest about a really serious problem. As preachers we lashed our congrega tions with devastating indictments and demands for speedy economic reconstruc tion. I am frankly amazed at the tolerance of our business men members who loy ally continued to pay the salaries of those who flogged them. It was a thrilling ex perience; all this resolving and declaim ing. And as long as it remained fun, we did not stop long to evaluate it. But after a while the newness wore off.<query> what was the purpose of the christian ideal</query> The ap pointment of two cooperators along with members of Parliament, the Cabinet, and other leaders of civic and industrial life, was an acknowledgment of the impor tant part the cooperatives play in Swed ish life. In the few days at their disposal free from the functions of the celebration, the Swedish co-op leaders made an impor tant contribution to the thinking of the American cooperative movement. Albin Johansson spake over a nation-wide net work of the Columbia Broadcasting Sys tem, July 11 (Mr. Johansson's address ap pears in another part of this issue of Con sumers' Cooperation.) The same evening I at a dinner given by the Cooperative Co ordinating Committee of Greater New York in honor of the cooperative lead ers, Mr. Gjores outlined the educational work of the Swedish cooperatives and Mr. Johansson hammered home the need of the cooperatives to build up powerful reserves of their own capital through cash trading if they are going to break the strangle hold of monopoly.<query> who were the leaders of the cooperative movement</query> Axel Gjores spoke over radio station WEVD, outlining the growth of the co operatives in his country and showing the reasons why they are now looked upon as the outstanding business and adult education organizations in Sweden. At a press conference attended by repre sentatives of all of the important metro politan papers and many trade and gen eral magazines, the co-op leaders report ed that K. F. had added the linoleum monopoly to the string o'f trusts it had broken. On the mere threat that the co ops would build their own linoleum fac tory, the trusts dropped prices 15 per cent.

In ac cepting the gift, E. R.

""All we want is the good fellowship you have extended to us,"" Mr. Johansson replied. So just before they sailed Mr. Johans son and Mr. Gjores were each presented with a leather pocket case inscribed ""Good Fellowship from Cooperators of the U. S. A."" BRITISH GUILD LEADER TOURS U. S.

This was the ques tion which the fifty young people faced at the National Cooperative Recreation School held at Waukegan, 111. , June 10 to 22. Designed to provide training in recreational leadership, the school was eminently successful from every point of view. Students were given every op portunity for active participation in such recreational activities as folk dancing, puppetry, dramatics, music, leather crafts anld games. In addition lectures were given on .the theory of recreation and dis cussions held on the problems of organ ization and operation of recreation on a community basis. In the past, it was pointed out, most of our recreation has been based on self- interest.<query> what was the purpose of the national cooperative recreation school</query> Although recreation leaders thought they were developing loyalty and self-sacrifice through the use of teams, contests and points, what has come out is individualism and fierce com petition. It is essential that we develop a new type of recreation in harmony with our cooperative philosophy. Students dis covered that through group play individ uals share a common experience and thus learn to think, feel and act in terms of others. Problem Solvers — Not Individualists Headlining the staff of instructors of the school was Miss Neva L. Boyd, De partment of Sociology, North-western University. Miss Boyd's philosophy of play which has grown out of her pion eering in recreation problems, and her wide knowledge of the folk dances and games of all countries were a real stimu lus to the students. Lectures and discus sions on the function of leadership were also led by Miss Boyd.<query> what is the philosophy of play</query> ""The great prob- 124 lern of leadership is to so select and pre sent the problems which vitally concern the group with which you are dealinq that they will voluntarily try to solve them. What we need to do is to develop better solvers of social problems not bet ter 'individualists' "". ' Miss Ruth Chorpenning, New York City, directed the worik in dramatics. The creation of an original play, a class in play writing, class work on charades, pantomimes, and a mass chant, in addition to the theory of directing were part of the training received. Emphasis was placed on the use of dramatics as a group project in which attention is shifted from the individual to the group thus releas ing creative ability and making for social adjustment. The participation of a majority of the students in leather crafts was proof that they recognized constructive values in crafts as well as in games, dances, drama and music.<query> who directed dramatics</query> Class work bore out the con clusion that it is not only necessary to have good materials for real craft work but the articles should be useful, of good design and of lasting value. Miss Lois Landfear, Ashtabula, Ohio, directed the craft work. Other activities included puppetry un der the direction of Miss Margaret Gard ner, Chicago, in which ingenious use was made of materials at hand. Work was also given in the operation of puppets. Instruction in instrumental music and de velopment of group playing and singing was given by Miss Phyllis Randall, Downers Grove, Illinois. In all of these activities learning by active participation was emphasized. To Carry On the Work All of those present at the conference became members of the Cooperative S» Consumers' Cooperation cjety for Recreational Education which was formed by the sta'ff and members of the first National Cooperative Recrea tion School in 1935 for the purpose of promoting recreational education and of continuing the School.<query> who was the teacher of puppetry</query> Membership is limited to those attending the School. Those elected to serve on the board of directors for the coming year were: prank Shilston, Minnesota; Gertrude Emerson, Pennsylvania; Sylvia Viternia, Nebraska; Verner Hegg, Minnesota; Neva Boyd, Illinois; Carl Hutchinson, Ohio and Father Gillis, Nova Scotia. As in previous years the School was spon sored by The Cooperative League of the U. S. A. A cooperative store handling literature, supplies, .refreshments and leather goods was operated by the students. The store reported total sales of $166.75, and a saving of 26%—16% was turned over to the conference fund and 10% returned as patronage savings on purchases. Recreation Builds Cooperation The students at the school represented a wide range of interests although the largest number were from rural groups. Many came as delegates from .coopera tive wholesales and local cooperative groups which are recognizing that the philosophy of cooperation demands a dif ferent type of recreation than that which has been developed in the competitive system.<query> what is the cooperative league</query> 75c.

This is one of the most important books on co operation.

Snowballs Won't Stop Depressions Not only tame, but obviously futile. The tornado of depression blew us out of our comfortable security and close enough to the precipice of economic col lapse so that we could look over the brink —and shudder. Something more than preaching was needed here. The volcano of Mars had not been shattered by its previous eruption. Suddenly it burst forth, covering Ethiopia, Spain, and China, and filling us all with dread with its ominous rumblings. No snowball res olutions were going to stop that. In America, the fires of labor disputes spread with a rapidity and lack of con trol which gave real concern. Every where strikers and worlkers were on the march; blood was being shed. No pro gram of quietly walking to church and listening to our ""powerful"" sermons was going to solve this situation.<query> what was the effect of the mars volcano eruption on the depression</query> There is a very close relationship between group play and cooperative eco nomic action. As Carl Hutchinson, Edu cation Department, Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperative Association, pointed out, ""Mutual participation in spontaneous ex pression prepares the members of the group for a more complete sharing in co operative discussion, cooperative plan ning and cooperative action."" COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH New York — Eastern Cooperative Wholesale, serving co-ops from Maine to Washington, D. C., has signed a lease for a new warehouse and headquarters at 135 Kent Ave., Brooklyn, which will have 27,000 sq. ft. of floor space as com pared with 9,000 sq. ft. in the present quarters. The co-op wholesale increased its business 86% last year. North Kansas City, Mo. — Consum ers Cooperative Association passed the half-million dollar mark for a single month of operation for the second time in its history in June when its sales total reached $520,631.<query> where is eastern co-op wholesale headquarters</query> This was in spite of the general business recession with other types of business running from 10 'to 50 per cent behind last year's volume. Harrisburg, Pa. — The Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Cooperative Association showed an increase in sales during the first three months of 1938 of 83% over the same period in 1937. Business of the quarter totaled $257,000. Three new county-wide co-ops were organized during that period; co-op auto insurance sales increased 51% while co-op life in surance sales gained 98%. August, 1938 Minneapolis — Eight hundred coop- erators including 172 delegates from lo cal co-ops in Minnesota and Wisconsin, meeting here for the 12th annual meet ing of Midland Cooperative Wholesale, voted to increase the capitalization of the organization to $1,000,000; increased the limit of indebtedness to equal capitaliza tion; heard manager E.

While cooperative purchasing was in creasing rapidly, cooperative marketing made much slower progress — increasing 125 from 11.3% in 1930 to 15.1% in 1938. The report points out that ""compared with the phenomenal increase in the pro portion of farmers making use of coop eratives in purchasing, the increase in the proportion selling cooperatively is, relatively small."" While the proportion of owners making cooperative purchases more than doubled in eight years, rising from 9% to 19.5%, the increase for ten ants 'from 3.9% to 13.5% is more than three times as great.<query> when did cooperative purchasing begin</query> The survey, which covered 3,000 farms in selected counties in 40 states was made by the field force of the Divi sion o'f Crop and Livestock Estimates of the U.

""by Bertram B. Fow ler, Vanguard Press, New York, 180 pages, special edition available through The Coopera tive League, $1.00. The next best thing to actually joining a coop erative tour to Nova Scotia is to read Mr. Fow ler's ""The Lord Helps Those . . ."" For Mr. Fow ler gives us the best description from first hand study and observation of the resurgence of the people of Nova Scotia yet written. The author brought to the study of the Cooperative Move ment of Nova Scotia a background of years of exhaustive study of the Cooperative Movement on the American Continent, and this present book reveals him as eminently qualified to tell the story of this modern, economic miracle.<query> who wrote the lord helps those</query> The pres ent reviewer feels that no one could have told it oetter. Though Nova Scotia is but a small province in comparison with the United States it offers, nev ertheless, a valid object lesson that Americans must learn if we are to save ourselves as the Nova Scotians saved themselves. Though our problems may be infinitely more complicated they are! fundamentally the same as those which confront ed the people of Little Dover, and the way out for us is fundamentally the same as for them. That way is self help, cooperation on the part of the people themselves, not the ""easy way to the never, never land"" by government regimenta tion, doles or dictatorships. Nova Scotia is fortunate in the quality of lead ership which came forth from St. Francis Xavier university in the persons of Dr. Tompkins. Dr. Coady, Mr. A. B. MacDonald and Mr. A. S. Maclntyre for they believed in the power of the People to do things for themselves if but shown we \vay.<query> what is the way out for nova scotia</query> These leaders worked with the people for August, 1938 whom and with whom it seemed utterly impos sible even to begin. Though originally of fine, courageous stock they had been beaten into eco nomic slavery by ruthless exploitation; their fish ermen, the sorry serfs of unprincipled dealers; their farmers, the dispossessed tenants of unpro ductive farms; their miners and steel workers, wage slaves of the most hopeless kind. That with ignor ance, illiteracy, under-nourishment and all the other accompaniments of extreme poverty would seemingly make them poor material with which to build a new civilization but Dr. Tompkins and the men of Antigonish had that supreme faith in the people that is just now proving so justified. What these people under such leadership ac complished is vividly told by Mr. Fowler. A hap pier day ,had indeed dawned for Nova Scotia and as Mr. Fowler points out much more significant than the return of mere economic prosperity has been the awakening of the people to the con sciousness of their own power.<query> who were the leaders of antigonish</query> We could no longer remain content merely to let our intellectual and spiritual motors run ""free engine""; no matter how smoothly they purred, or how frighteningly they roared. We just had to have some way of gearing them into an actual program in 10 which we could see that we were act accomplishing results. a""V The Idealist Faces Reality But what to do? Communism, fasc- and other forms of dictatorship Were Sm pugnant. Socialism? The Socialist Pa'f was steadily losing ground. Furtherr^/ would the turning over of our comnl ' industrial structure to a group of u * doubtedly sincere idealists result in an^ thing but a mess? Some joined the picket lines and .tihrew in .their lot with the labo movement; in a few cases, even resiqnino their pulpits or chairs to do so. But there most church leaders are not at home.<query> what was the idealist face</query> There is a hope fulness and a self-reliance and courage that in sures that the education for action which they have received and are continuing has forever left behind depressions, poverty, insecurity and en slavement. Mr. Fowler's book ought to be re quired reading in every seminary, Catholic and non-Catholic, in the land. It would be well, too, if every member of every faculty0 of every col lege and university could be persuaded to read it. For it might jolt our religious and educational leaders out of their complacency, their indiffer ence or their confusion, and stir them to bring the facilities of education to the American people a- Jong the same Jines as St. Francis Xavier Uni versity is working for its people. The greatest need in the country today is men like the men of Antigonish. They are showing us a way out that can certainly be used in the United States even more successfully than it is being used in Nova Scotia.<query> why was mr. fowler's book important</query> — Rev.

A COOPERATIVE COMMUNITY (Editorial note: Among the beautiful gems which flashed through the prose writings of the Jate George Russell (A.E.), the following descrip tion of a Cooperative Community is one of the most scintillating.<query> what is cooperative</query> Per haps they are frightened by the revela tions of racketeering and dictatorship in the movement. More likely they are just not built, temperamentally, for the rigors unpleasantnesses and fighting involved So there they were; sincere idealists, with an earnest determination to contribute to a solution of our social problems, but with no place in which they seemed to fit. And then along came the cooperative movement, like a veritable Sir Galahad, to rescue the fair maiden of ideals from the castle of futility and frustration. In the first place, it actually embodied the Christian ideal of service as the primary purpose of business. O yes, private en terprise talks much of 'service', and ac tually does render important services. But it serves in order to get. Services are rendered primarily as a means to a great er end, and that end is private profit, which means that someone makes money out of someone else.<query> what is the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> It is taken from an out-of-print book which was published in 1913 under the title ""Cooperation and Nationality."" Those who can find the book in their libraries will have a happy and inspiring evening reading it.) ' ' A 'RURAL commune or cooperative •**• community ought to have, to a large extent, the character o;f a nation. If should 'manufacture for its members all things which it profitably can manu facture for them, employing its own workmen, carpenters, bootmakers, mak ers and menders of farming equipment, saddlery, harness, etc. It should aim at feeding its members and their families cheaply and well, as far as possible ouf of the meat and grain produced in the district. It should have a mill to grind their grain, a creamery to manufacture their butter; or where certain enterprises like a bacon factory are too great for it, it should unite with other cooperative communities to furnish out such an enter prise.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative</query> It should seil for the members their prolduce, and buy for them their require ments, and hold fo-r them labor-saving machinery. It should put aside a certain portion of its profits every year for the creation of halls, libraries, places for rec reation and games, and it should pursue this plan steadily with the purpose of giving its members every social and edu cational advantage which the civilization of tlheir time affords. It should have its councils or village parliaments, where improvements and new ventures could be discussed. Such a community would soon generate a passionate devotion to its own ideals and interests among the members, who would feel how their for tunes rose with the fortunes of the asso ciations of which they were all members. It would kindle and quicken the intellect of every person in the community. It would create the atmosphere in which national genius would emerge and find opportunities for its activity.<query> what is the purpose of a community</query> The clan 130 As described by George Russell (A.E > -'- ""Cooperation and Nationality/' in ought to be the antechamber of the na tion and the training ground for its statesmen. What opportunity leadership in the councils of such a rural communi ty would give to the best minds! The man of social genius at present finds an unor ganized community and lie does not know how to affect his fellow citizens. A man might easily despair of affecting the destinies of a nation of forty million peo ple, but yet start with eagerness to build up a kingdom of the size of Sligo, and s'hape it nearer to the heart's desire. The organization of the rural population of Ireland in cooperative associations will provide the instrument ready to the hand of the social reformer. Some associations will be more dowered with ability than others, but one will learn from another, and a vast network of living progressive organizations will cover rural Ireland, democratic in constitution and governed by the aristocracy of intellect and char acter.<query> what is the role of the rural population in ireland</query> ""Such associations would have greaf economic advantages in that they would be self-reliant and self-contained, and would be less subject to fluctuation in their prosperity brought on by national disasters and commercial crises than the present unorganized rural communities are. They would have all their business under local control; and, aiming at feed ing, clothing, and manufacturing locally from local resources as far as possible, the slumps in foreign trade, the shortage in supplies, the dislocations of commerce would affect them but little. They would make the community wealthier. Every step towards this organization already taken in Ireland has brought with it in creased prosiperity, and the towns benefit by increased purchasing power on the part of these rural associations. New arts and industries would spring up under the aegis of the local associations. Here we should find the weaving of rugs, there the manufacture of toys, elsewhere the women would be engaged in embroidery or lace-making, and perhaps, every we might get a revival of the old local industry of weaving homespuns.<query> what is the economic advantage of rural associations</query> \\re are dreaming of nothing impossible, nothing which has not been done some where already, nothing which we could not do here in Ireland. True, it can not be done all at once, but if we pet the idea clearly in our minds of the building up of a rural civiliza tion in Ireland we can labor at it with the grand persistence of medieval burghers in their little towns, where one- generation laid down the foundations of a great cathedral, and saw only in hope and faith the gorgeous glooms over altar and sanctuary, and the blaze and flame of stained glass, where apostles, prophets, and angelic ipresences were pictured in fire; and the next generation raised high the walls, and only the third generation saw the realization of what their grand- sires had dreamed."" WHAT IS A COOPERATOR? 1. A Cooperator is one who voluntarily practices self-help as a member of a democratic, non-profit group, rather than accepting dictatorial compul sion by profit business or the political state.<query> what is a cooperator</query> 2. A Cooperator is one who accepts the principles of Cooperation and becomes a member of a Cooperative Association. These principles are basical ly two in number: First, Democratic control resulting from Open Member ship and One Person-One Vote, and second, Non-profit Business resulting, from Limited Interest on Capital and Patronage Dividends on Purchases. 3. A Cooperator is one who takes a democratic part in the membership- meetings of his Cooperative Association by expressing publicly his un prejudiced judgment on matters with which he is familiar and by casting his vote according to his conclusions arrived at after fully weighing his own and others' judgments. 4. A Cooperator is one who willingly accepts, without solicitation, his obligation to carry out the assignments for which he may be democratically selected, whether as a member of a committee, a director, an officer, or an employee, and earnestly endeavors to fulfill them to the best of his ability.<query> what is cooperator</query> 5. A Cooperator is one who is ever active in persuading others to accept the principles of Cooperation and to become active members of Consumers', Producers' and Public Cooperatives. 6. A Cooperator is one who maintains a cooperative attitude in all his individual dealings with his fellows and who sincerely endeavors to practice the principles of Cooperation in all his social affairs. 7. A Cooperator is one who has abiding faith in the inevitable growth of Cooperation and the eventual overcoming of individual greed by mutual co operation. 8. A Cooperator is one whose entire life is committed to bringing into existence a complete Cooperative Society—Ethically, Educationally, Politi cally and Economically. 9. A Cooperator is one who believes that ""the least of us can stand for the greatest things."" The great thing for which a Cooperator stands is the belief that Cooperation is the principle of brotherhood, democracy and free dom applied to finance, industry and agriculture and that it will abolish poverty by eliminating unemployment, destitution and tenancy and will help to abolish war by eliminating economic conflicts.<query> what is cooperator</query> 10. A Cooperator is one who believes that Economic Cooperation is synonymous with and the necessary accompaniment of Political Democracy, Educational Freedom and Spiritual Brotherhood. Consumers' Cooperation September, 1938 13F SWEDISH COOPERATIVES PROMOTE ADULT EDUCATION AMONG the leaders' of Sweden visit ing the' United States in connection with the"" Tercentenary celebration of the settlement on the Delaware was Axel Gjores, who is in charge of organization and education of the Kooperativa For- bundet, the Swedish Cooperative Union and Wholesale. As one interested in adult education I interviewed Mr. Gjores and put to him many questions in regard to the experience of the Swedish co operatives in carrying on adult ed ucation. It will surprise many Americans to learn that the Swedish consumers' co operatives are one of the most important agencies of adult education in that country. They have developed the small study circle as a device of education to as high a point as can be found any where in the world.<query> who is a cooperator</query> They are teaching systematic courses by correspondence in a way that many a university in the United States would look upon with envy. They are the largest publishers of economic books in Sweden. They publish a weekly journal which is the most widely circulated paper in the nation. They have established1 their own college to train employees, committeemen and specially selected members. Business Plus Education Equals Cooperation ""Why did you go into this 'wholesale' adult education?"" I asked Mr. Gjores. His answer was: ""Because it was abso lutely necessary. We are compelled to carry on this extensive program if we ""want to build a soundly functioning and successful economic democracy. A co operative, you know, is both a business and a school."" The weekly paper of the Swedish co operatives, I found, is a lively publica tion.<query> why did sweden go into whole sale education</query> It has a wide scope. It d'eals not only with economics, cooperative prin ciples and methods, and the rather fa miliar material of cooperative journals, but also with literature and all sorts of cultural interests. 132 Benson Y. Landis, Associate Secretary Department of Research and Education Federal Council of Churches The noted Swedish economist, Gustav Cassel, who prefers to have his books published by the Swedish cooperatives says that as compared with commercial publishers the cooperative leaders have a keen interest in his books and have a way of interesting people in them. Four or five important books are brought out every year and a much larger number of pamphlets and booklets. For training employees and commit teemen there are numerous short courses at the cooperative college. These people come for a week or for a month. Two large buildings house the activities of the college and the ""K. F."" puts 125,000 kroner into it.<query> who is the founder of the cooperatives</query> It is taken for granted that services which do not pay. at least in 'good will with a potential cash value, will not be given. The whole busi ness relationship is fundamentally that of people who are trying to get as much as possible out of each other. Thus the pur chaser tries to get as much value as pos sible, regardless of the interests of the merchant, and the merchant tries to get as much profit as possible out of the cus tomer. While personal considerations are by no means absent, the whole atmos phere tends to be, every man on guard against his neighbor. ""in the cooperative movement, this whole situation is reversed. The enter prise exists as one that serveth in order actually to serve; not to make P™tltso The whole idea of the movement is to k Consumers' Cooperation to every individual, all excess expenses which would otherwise u taken from him in the form of profits.<query> what is the whole idea of the cooperative movement</query> Local societies provide scholarships and pay expenses of those who come to study. A Broad Program of Leadership Training The subjects taught by correspond ence surprised me. Of course, account ing is taught and other commercial sub jects, but that is not all: Swedish and English, economics, public finance, cit izenship, literature and in recent years even a number of courses in engineer ing, mathematics and chemistry, 25 sub jects in all. The study circles were started about 1920. First the program was rather vague and informal. People were' gotten together and told to discuss their vital interests. After a few years it was found that national direction was needed. Now numerous small text and guide books are published and circulated for study by these groups. Over 40,000 people are members of them. The average age of members is about 30.<query> what subjects are taught in the study circles</query> Two-thirds are men, one third are women, but the pro portion of women is gaining. I asked what proportion of their funds the local associations devoted to educa tion. Mr. Gjores said that the rule was that 2>£ per cent of the net surplus should go for education but added that every society that he could think of was spending more. Consumers' Cooperation A COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP AND TRADE DRIVE J. W. Cummins, Editor 'Cooperative Consumer"" T\THEN Dorothea Brande challenged W the world to ""Wake Up and Live"" she expressed in that title a thought which copperatives might w.ell use in put ting on .an annual membership and trade drive. Cooperatives that stay wide- av/ake will perhaps live longer. Certainly it js .dangerous to grow somnolent in a \yorl,d that moves as fast as this .one. Some cooperatives, like other enter prises, do get in a >ru-t. Some are suffer ing 'from dry -rot.<query> what is the proportion of the net surplus that should go to education?</query> The deadening hand of inertia has seized not a few. And no matter whether the business be coopera tive, or privately-owned, the tempta tion to maintain the status quo, rather than push iforward according to well- thought-out plans, is ever present. Louis Untermeyer sensed it when he pleaded, ""Lord, keep me still unsatisfied."" Middle West cooperatives are a rep resentative lot. There are as many live ones here as anywhere, and as many'that need to be awakened if they expect to live. To stimulate the live ones, and to arouse the lethargic ones, cooperative members of Consumers Cooperative As sociation, North Kansas City, Mo., de cided last winter that there could be no better way of doing it than to launch a membership and trade drive. Although the campaign during Febru ary and March, this year, was the first of its kind ever undertaken by these co operatives, directors have voted to make it an annual affair.<query> what is the middle west cooperative</query> Members will no doubt sustain the board of directors when they hold their annual meeting October 10 and 11. If they do, then each year from now on, when the grip of winter begins to loosen, and the promises of an other springtime are felt, rather than seen, when hope is in the ascendancy, the co operative wholesale and its member co operatives will be out in the field work ing to win n-ew members, to bring back members who are lukewarm or who may have quit patronizing cooperatives alto gether; to recharge the spirit and enthu siasm o'f those loyal men and women without whom there would be no coop erative movement. September, 1938 London Cooperative Society's Campaign It all began in London, England, in September, 1937, when Howard A. Cow- den, president of CCA, called on James Mylles, publicity director for the world's largest retail cooperative — the London Cooperative Society.<query> when did the london cooperative society begin</query> This society, with less than 200,000 in 1925 has between 700..000 and 800,000 members today. It conducts a successful membership and,, trade drive annually, and has since 1925. Not all its great growth has been due to these drives, of course, since several smaller societies have been amalgamated in that time, but most of that increase can be traced to these annual campaigns. How the membership of the London Cooperative Society has increased stead ily because of these annual membership and trade drives is shown clearly in the table that follows: Year New Members, 1925 ................ 10,871 1926 ................ 15,224 1927 ................ 19,767 1928 ................ 27,248 1929 ................ 26,468 1930 ................ 26,757 1931 ................ 23,310 1932 ................ 20,662 1933 ................ 24,742 1934 ................ 30,326 1935 ................ 37,995 1936 ................ 49,130 1937 ................ 44,823 1938 ................ 58,693 Of the 1938 drive, Mr. Mylles, in a letter of February 7 to Mr. Cowden had this to S.ay: ""Our campaign ended January 29, and from the first to the twenty-ninth, we enrolled 58,693 new members.<query> how many members does the london cooperative society have</query> Although we have run these campaigns every year since 1925, our latest has been our big gest success. Our trade drive during the same period' showed an increase of $635,- 545. The result has been a great stimur .lant to all our members and we are look ing forward to a record trade for this fiscal year."" 133; The critic, of course, questions wheth- •er cooperatives can be built soundly by the campaign method. Naturally, there must be ""backsliders."" Doesn't it take something more than drives to win and Tiold consumers for the cooperative move ment? It does, of course. Cooperatives must be well^managed and efficient to win and hold members. On these points we questioned Mrs. Eleanor Barton, who made a series of addresses in July in OCA territory. As general secretary of the Women's Guild •of Great Britain for 12 years, she has had many opportunities to observe the an nual membership and trade drive of the London Society at close range.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative</query> Guild members, as a mat ter of fact, .participate in these campaigns. Mrs. Barton expressed en thusiasm for these annual efforts to win more members and more trade. There are backsliders, yes. But most of them stay, she says. And there's always the •chance of getting the badkslider next year, and a chance that he'll ""stick"" next 'time. Consumers Cooperative Association Adopts Plans Mr. Cowden returned from Europe 'filled with enthusiasm over the program of the London Society. He felt it was one thing which should1 be transplanted to America. He called the OCA staff to- •gether and plans for the first annual membership and trade drive of CCA were laid. At district meetings through out the territory served by the whole sale, in December and January, plans for the membership and trade drive were given to the people.<query> what is the purpose of the consumer cooperative association</query> District meetings are gatherings where the ""hired men"" of the wholesale meet and talk face to face with their employ ers, and the employees do not do all the talking. Policies are discussed and ""whipped into shape. These meetings, with the annual meeting, are the means ""by which the affairs of the wholesale are kept as democratic as it is possible to make them. Our people caught the spirit of the thing and voted approval of the drive. Hundreds pledged themselves to ta'ke an active part in it. It was estimated at that time that 120,- '000 consumers owned CCA. The goal for the 60-day drive was set at 10 per cent 134 of that figure, or 12,000 members. Prior to February 1, when the cam paign began, a statement was prepared in the offices of CCA and submitted f endorsement to leaders of the Farm Bu reau.<query> what is the purpose of district meetings</query> Farmers Union, Grange, and Equi"" ty, and to managers of cooperative mar keting and purchasing organizations"" Twenty such leaders endorsed it. The statement was printed attractively, -with the pictures of ^the endorsers, and was given the title, ""Join a Cooperative To day."" It 'dealt with the evils growing out of extreme wealth concentration, and suggested cooperatives as the answer. It was widely distributed and proved high ly effective. ""Join a Cooperative Today"" came to be the slogan of the campaign. To further stimulate interest among local cooperatives, the central associa tion offered! a prize to the manager who would send in the best plan for the com ing contest. Literature prepared in the central office, based in part on plans submitted by local managers, contained suggestions for planning the local drive down to the last detail.<query> what was the slogan of the cooperative movement</query> A paragraph from one of these printed bulletins, for example, says: ""Select your captains, choose up sides, and decide how you will conduct the drive. Discuss what you want to do for the winning team. A lot of folks like to have the winners eat peaches and cream at the roundl-up meeting, when the drive closes, while the losers have to be con tent with mush and milk."" A circular pin, of lapel size, was de signed to be given to each person who signed five or more new members dur ing the contest. In the center were the letters ""CCA,"" and surrounding it were the words, ""1938 Award. Membership Drive."" Nearly 1,000 persons qualified for these emblems, and most of the win ners are wearing them today. Free Trips for Prize Winners CCA at that time had 12 fieldmen, and a definite territory allotted to each man.<query> when was the cca membership drive</query> Therefore no one makes anything out of vbody else- This tends to eliminate, t only the incentive to cheat, but also V incentive to persuade tlie customer make purchases contrary to his own •„terests. Needless to point out, the whole 'tmosphere toward personal relationships becomes transformed. Consumers coop eration furnishes a technique which makes it possible for individuals to act spiritually toward each other in their eco nomic relationships. The significance of this possibility can .hardly be over-esti mated. Other considerations, hardly less im portant, have commended the cooperative movement to religious people. Most im portant, it is an action program; some thing which can be done; right now, even by timid professional people. You can actually see the results of your 'ef forts. No more having to wait until the majority voted the socialist ticket.<query> what is cooperative behavior</query> It was decided that the two persons in each fieldrnan's territory signing the most new members during the contest would be given a free trip to the tenth annual meeting of CCA in Kansas City, October 10 and 11, and to the Bien nial Congress of The Cooperative League of the U. S. A. which follows immediate- Consumers' Cooperation ]y on October 12, 13 and 14. So. on the second day of the tenth annual meeting next October, 24 winners will march proudly to the stage and be given a blue ribbon each as an award of merit for their work. And they're counting the Jays between now and October 10! For each new member signed, 1 point was given. For each $1 collected at the time on the membership fee, 1 point was qiven. If, for example, the membership fee was $10 and was collected in full, 11 points would be given, 1 for signing the member and a point for each $1.<query> when is the cca annual meeting</query> For two or more purchases made by a member vvho had not made a purchase since Jan uary 1, 1937, 2 points were given. An acceptance blank was filled out, signed, and mailed in to CCA by every manager whose cooperative entered the contest. The form called for information about the local cooperative and gave in detail the rules of the contest. Local Publicity and Campaign Methods The central office furnished display cards on which the local companies could list their new members; cards large enough to have advertising value when hung anywhere in the office. It provided point record cards also for keeping the record of each contestant; membership application books for the use of solici tors; copies of the broadside, ""Join a Cooperative Today,"" and printed copies of the radio talks that were given during the drive over six stations that blanketed eighi or more states.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative contest</query> In addition to these, letters from President Cowden were sent out periodically to the leaders; informa tive letters that told what people in va rious areas were accomplishing; letters that had the effect of knitting the drive together. The market letter of CCA, which goes to managers each wedk, carried timely news of the contest. The Cooperative Consumer, its official paper, devoted much of its space to furthering the drive and in serving as a mirror for the whole territory. Directors of CCA, fieldmen and speakers who volunteered their serv ices, all contributed to making the drive the success 'it was. Every effort was made to get all areas into action at the same time and to get the idea across that this was not a series of little drives September, 1938 but one mammoth drive, with thousands of people doing the same thing at the same time.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative consumer drive</query> But those who bore the ""heat and bur den"" of the day were the directors, man agers, and other employees of the local cooperative associations. They did the actual work of signing new members and winning back the trade of inactive mem bers. They vied with one another in qualifying for the 1938 CCA pin. There was friendly rivalry in determining who would be first and second in each field- man's territory, thus winning a free trip to the annual meeting of the wholesale and the Cooperative Congress. Generally speaking, the drive was carried on by opposing teams within a local, although several cooperatives adopted the ""neighbor nights"" plan in use by the Midland Cooperative Whole sale, where neighbors met at the home of a neighbor for an evening of discus sion and recreation. In a few locals, so great was the enthusiasm, that workers continued to sign new members after the drive had ended officially.<query> what was the cooperative drive</query> Radio Programs Blanket Territory A word about the radio program may be of interest. Three times each week during the two months, six of the better radio stations, so located as to best serve the whole territory, carried five-minute programs that were tied in with the membership and trade drive. They were recordings prepared by Mr, Cowden and directed not only to the membership but also to the public-at4arge. Many people became acquainted for the first time with CCA and its services. The talks created discussion over the whole territory and paved the way for the solicitors who fol lowed up. Several owners of private bus iness, after listening to the programs over the air, wrote in and wanted to turn their businesses into cooperatives. One busi ness man at Topeka, Kan., phoned the manager of the station there and urged him to cancel our time.<query> what was the blanket territory</query> The cooperatives he said, were always ""butting in"" on privately-owned business. The radio talks dealt with the early history pf the cooperative movement; how it differs from corporate business, the rise and growth of CCA and some thing of the goods and services it pro* vides; the movement in other states and 135 in other nations; ""trust-busting"" by the Swedish cooperatives; international co operative trade; reciprocal trading; how the people of Nova Scotia are rehabili tating themselves through cooperatives; the accomplishments of local coopera tives; burial associations; cooperative medicine, and so on. But the central theme running through the series of 26 talks was that consumers, when they unite their spending power, are all powerful. Two paragraphs from the talks are illustrative of this: ""Middle-class consumers may not have much money, but they do have patronage and patronage refund, two things more powerful than any aggregation of mere capital behind any industry in these United States.<query> what was the main theme of the cooperative movement</query> You may be poor, but you're not too poor to join a cooperative and begin giving it your patronage now. Eventually you'll earn a share of stock. So join a cooperative today! The Roch dale pioneers did and they came out all right. ""When you Sipend your dollars you are casting your economic ballot either1 for the private profit system or for the system that operates for service at cost. The decision is yours. Those who cast their ballots for the profit system cannot complain logically of the evils of wealth concentration, of monopoly prices, of vicious swings in the business cycle. They cannot, with good grace, protest against wide price spreads between pro ducer and consumer, or complain of the inefficiencies of our distributive system. Aren't they voting for it when they spend their dollars with that system when they either refuse or neglect to take charge of their own economic destiny?"" Increased Membership and Trade Results A check-up at the end of the contest revealed that 119 member cooperatives had signed 4,945 new members.<query> who said when you sipend your money you are casting your economic ballot either for the private While this figure was far short of the goal of 12,000, those cooperatives that did take part exceeded their 10 per cent quota rather easily. The trouble was that only 119 companies out of approximately 400 had taken part. The membership and trade drive was something new to most managers. Many of them did not sense its significance and importance. A lot of them see it now, after witnessing co- Bo operatives near them take on new Ijf and trade as a result of it. Participation next year will be more nearly represen tative beyond doubt. The membership and trade drive is de veloping local leadership, one of the great needs of the cooperative movement. Em ployees, who had never believed they possessed ""sales"" ability, or speaking ability, have gained new confidence in themselves as a result of the drive. Many of them learned that a Jot of people were only waiting to be invited to take a share in the local cooperative.<query> what is the importance of the membership and trade drive</query> One of the most successful of these employees wrote us after the contest: ""I was surprised,"" Jie said, ""to learn that so many people were anxious to be come members of a cooperative and would rather trade where they have a share in the business."" Other tangible and intangible gains ap pear. Thousands of people have become interested in cooperatives from hearing the radio talks, by reading campaign lit erature, and by hearing speakers on the subject. The local cooperative becomes a center of community interest during the contest, and with each new member add ed there is an immediate gain in volume of business. And larger cooperative units, with greater volume and lower over head per unit, is another need of the movement. The effect of the membership and1 trade drive on GCA's trade has been marked. Only twice in its history has its volume of business in any one month ex ceeded $500,000.<query> what is the benefit of a cooperative</query> The first time was in July, 1937, when the total business done reached $520,631.53. The second time was in June, this year, when sales reached $520,219.57. This record was made in spite of the fact that commodities are lower in price, this year than last, and in spite of the fact that volume this year, in many lines, is running from 10 to 50 per cent behind a year ago. If you're wondering whether or not the membership and trade drive has paid, here's the answer. With out that drive, and the addition of 4,945 new members, it is ex tremely doubtful if CCA would be running ahead of last year in volume. For more than one local cooperative, the drive has meant the difference between a net saving and a net loss. COOPERATIVES SHOULD MOVE FASTER!<query> when was the first cca membership drive</query> Nor need you risk too much on the outcomes of sudden and sweeping changes. You could start at the bottom and build up; learn from vour mistakes without piling up a debt which threatens the whole monetary structure. Furthermore, it was essentially democratic, and in harmony with the best of American traditions. In •the cooperative movement, then, church people have seen a technique for a sane, orderly, and growingly successful pro gram of action. No wonder they have fairly flocked into the movement; often with more zeal than understanding. Will the movement ""succeed?"" Cer tainly cooperation is no patent medicine for the solution of all human problems from fallen arches to dandruff. It will no more prevent fascism than typhoid innoc- ulations will prevent automobile acci dents or the bubonic plague. Further more, its significance for the Church is not primarily economic, but spiritual.<query> what was the cooperative movement</query> FROM GASOLINE TO GROCERIES FROM ANIMAL FEED TO HUMAN FOOD THE cooperative purchasing of feed in America was started on a wide spread scale about twenty years ago. fhe cooperative purchasing of gaso^ line was started about fifteen years ago. Why don't cooperatives progress more rapidly in each community from feed to food, from gasoline to groceries? Why don't cooperatives move faster in Amer ica? According to the Farm Credit Ad ministration we now have twenty-nine cooperative wholesales which purchase over a million dollars' worth of farm supplies annually. Only four of the twenty-nine are yet purchasing grocer ies cooperatively. We are never very ha.ppy when we are told that a feed store or gasoline station has been in existence a long number of years unless it has expanded into home supplies as well. The Next Step When Sir William Dudley, former president of the Cooperative Wholesale Society of Great Britain, challenged us with the question as to why, in America, we started with feed for cows' stom achs and fuel for tractors' stomachs, rather than food for human stomachs, we defended our initial beginnings vig orously, both because we did not want an Englishman to discount Americans and because we believe that American •farmers were wise in choosing these two commodities on which to start.<query> why did cooperative purchasing start</query> When we stated that these two commodities were widely used, were comparatively simple commodities to handle, and were sold at excessive prices, and that cocpera- tors were going to use the savings on such farm supplies to help start coop-1 erative purchasing of home supplies, we were gratified to have Mr. Dudley re ply, ""Oh! Now I see! You are on the right track."" But we had to hold our tongue in our cheek when he asked the further question. ""When are you going into groceries?"" Consumers' Cooperation September, 1935 E. R. Bowen, General Secretary The Cooperative League Two years ago when he asked the question only three farm supply whole sales were handling groceries. Since then another has started to do so and a fifth wholesale is planning a grocery department. Why not others? We are never able to get out of our minds, when we think of this question, an illustra^- tion of what happened in Switzerland in the case of the VOLG at Winterthur.<query> when are you going into groceries</query> This wholesale is one of the few in Europe which started with farm supplies. Most of the European cooperatives started with home supplies. The VOLG has recently celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. It began in 1886 hanidfling fertilizer and in 1892, or only six years later, it began handling gro ceries as well. Yet some of our farm supply wholesales are from ten to twen ty years old and are not yet handling groceries or apparently seriously mak ing plans to do so. In his new book, ""Cooperation—An American Way,"" John Daniels has a chapter which he entitles ""A New Dis covery."" What he has discovered are a few simple figures which are available to every cooperator, covering the a- mount of money expended by farmers for various kinds of farm and home sup plies. He quotes in his book statistics from the Bureau of Agricultural Eco nomics of the Department of Agricul ture in Washington, showing that for the five years from 1924-29 a sample group of American farmers spent $608 for family maintenance as compared with $466 for farm maintenance, or 30% more for family maintenance than for farm maintenance.<query> when did farm supply start</query> (See complete table and chart on page 139.) He also quotes figures from Cornell University of Ithaca, New York, covering an investigation of the finan ces of one hundred and ninety-five farm families which show that those below a $750 income spent 58.6% of their expenditures for household uses, and 137 farm families with incomes from $750 to $2250 spent half of their total ex penditures for household uses. (See complete table.) FINANCES OF 195 FARM FAMILIES (Tompkins County, N. Y., 1927-28) (From Bulletin 522, May, 1931, Cornell Universi ty, Ithaca, N. Y., Survey by Helen Cannon of ""The Family Finances of 195 Farm Families in Torapkins County, N. Y., 1927-28"".) Spent for Spent for Hous'd Uses Farming $471-58.6% $333-41.4% 646-51.0% 620-49.0% 800-48.3% 856-51.7% Below $750 Income $750-$1490 Income $1500-$2249 Income In October, 1937, Fortune Magazine published a table of total estimated ex penditures by farmers for the year 1937.<query> what is the average farm family income in ithaca ny</query> The figures have very much surprised many peoplle. They show that the total amounts estimated to be spent for the kinds of farm supplies which are pur chased by farm cooperative wholesales are far less than the amounts spent for various kinds of home supplies. For ex ample, for feed, seed and fertilizer, $750,000,000 (or 7.5%) and for cost of operating autos, tractors and trucks, $470,000,000 (or 4.7%), which are the two principal commodity lines into which the Cooperative Movement has entered1. As compared with these two commodi ties purchased for the farm, the table gives these figures covering commodities purchased for the farmer—for store- bought food, $1,610,000,000 (or 16.1%) and for clothing, $1,150,000,000 (or 11.5%). (See complete table on page 139). Farmers Are Consumers When food is so much larger an item even in the budgets of farmers, it is strange that we have not moved faster into the human food field.<query> what is the average cost of a farm</query> Some people say that the reason we have .moved so slowly into the human food field is that our cooperatives were started by men and! not by women. Some think the reason is that farmers have thought first of reducing their cost of production rather than their cost of personal living. Some say that it is be cause single purchases of farm supplies bulk larger as compared with the smaller 138 but steady purchasing of groceries. Oth ers believe the answer is in the fact that we do not yet think of the Cooperative Movement as a part of the rebuilding of our economic system over onto the the basis of non-profit, democratic con trol and widespread ownership. Some even suggest that the reason may be inertia in leadership. Well, isn't it high time we started thinking more definitely about the sav ings to be made by the cooperative pur chasing of home supplies as well as farm supplies?<query> why did the cooperative movement start</query> With these statistics be fore us, how can we afford to do other wise? How can cooperative leaders fail to serve their members' needs in home supplies as well as farm supplies much longer? We Cannot Go It Alone Perhaps one of the reasons we have not moved faster is that the handling of groceries will involve the opening up of the membership of cooperatives to urban residents as well as farm resi dents, For no grocery store could suc ceed and serve only farm residents as compared with serving both -farm and urban residents. No private grocery store would think of attempting to re strict its customers to either one or the other, which means that no cooperative can do so either and meet competition. But this barrier must be faced and bro ken through some time and the sooner the better. As a sign used in Ohio says, ""We cannot go it alone."" And truly we cannot much longer.<query> why can't we go it alone</query> Rural and urban residents must get together as consum ers for their mutual benefit. They will find that Consumers' Cooperatives in which both are members will prove to be the solvent of their conflicts as farm and factory producers. Even though it means using a private- profit advertising slogan, we do not know anything more appropriate to con clude with than, ""Eventually! Why Not Now?"" Let's get going faster building the new ""Cooperative Economic Socie ty!"" Let's move faster from gasoline to groceries; from animal feed to human food!

Butts Recreational Director North Dakota Farmers Union FROM the little girl who dresses in . mother's cast-off finery, and the little boy with the huge false moustache, to the most sedate of us grown-ups, there is an inherent love of the dramatic. We love drama, both creating it and observing it. 1 Unfortunately, the latter method of satisfying our dramatic urge has most frequently come to the fore. America, af flicted with ""Spectator-itis"" as some clev er person has said, flocks in droves to watch its drama flicker across the silver screen.<query> what was the nd farmers union's production rate</query> For many, it has proved a veritable manna in a wilderness of frustration.

CONSUMERS' COOPERATIVES IN ACTION Superior, Wisconsin — Central Coop erative Wholesale, in cooperation with local cooperative stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Northern Michigan, will launch its first series of circuit schools Jor employee training January 3. The schools will be held at 18 points in the whole sale's territory and will consist of three sessions at eac'h point. Classes will be held in the evening so that employees from all neighboring co-op stores may at tend. The training will deal with tech nical points concerning advertising and service for groceries, appliances and auto equipment.<query> where is central cooperative wholesale located</query> The trials and tribulations, the awards and the joys of the actors are ours, synthetically. ""We get all the mental ""thrill of the chase"" with our bodies re laxed against the velvet upholstery of the theatre chairs. Undoubtedly, passive participation in the world of make-believe has a definite value. The keynote of the new recrea tional outlook, however, is active partici pation. In planning a new social system that will insure the well-rounded devel opment of individuals within it, we must give the possibilities of drama serious thought, and that phase should have our major consideration. Producing a play offers a large num ber of persons an opportunity for use of their talents. First, there must be a play written, or a definite pattern made for the story which is to be dramatized. I use the word ""written"" advisedly, for the most interesting play I have ever partici pated in was never written.<query> what is the role of play in a play</query> The play to which I refer was pro duced at the National Cooperative Rec reation School at Des Moines, during the conference of cooperative recreation leaders there in 1937. The play was à 140 genuinely cooperative production, creat ed .by the members of the dramatic class. We chose the setting and plot of our play first, then the characters we should use to depict it. All actors then tried to project themselves into the characters they were representing speaking such lines and using such action as seemed consistent with their various parts. Sug gestions -to others from co-actors and di rectors added spice and inspiration, so that in an amazingly short time we had evolved a bit of true cooperative drama. There was little danger of the actors for getting their lines, since said lines had 'been their own brain children!<query> what was the cooperative play</query> Follow- ïng this first experience of mine in co- 'operative play production, I have taken 'part in similar cooperative play ventures and have always found them extremely worthwhile as recreational projects. Well, we've the play written, the ac tors chosen—does that tell the story? No, for it takes many more persons to suc cessfully stage a play. The play itself is the recipe for the cake, the actors the ingredients judicially mixed — but there must be an oven of proper baking tem perature, careful watching, and frosting before the finished product is ready to set before admiring eyes. These vastly important details are supplied by the cos tume designers, the scene painters, the lighting expert, the sound man, the prop erty man, the director and all his crew of assistants. Do you see the wide range •of talents that lend themselves to the suc cessful production of drama?<query> what is the role of the actors in a play</query> The artist who expresses himself with a brush can do the scenery, the designers may plan the costumes, the seamstresses do the actual sewing. There is need for almost Consumers' Cooperation every talent in your community and an interesting channel for its expression. A play produced through the combined efforts of so many individuals is a true cooperative venture. Each person con tributing his own particular bit toward ithe final perfection of the whole, sets forth the ideal spirit of cooperation. Not ,the actors alone, nor the costumers, nor the 'director and his assistants, nor the scenery painters could have produced the final ensemble — but through combining their efforts, the result is a genuine achievement. Drama, well-acted, has character- building possibilities for the actors them selves. It is impossible to present a part convincingly unless you project yourself into the character you are presenting.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative play</query> The well-laid wall of personal habits that make your personality individual •may effectively keep out the light of the outside world. But a rock or two crashes from the wall and lets a bit of under standing in; once you have managed to get the other fellow's point of view, things look differently. You cannot help i being a trifle more sympathetic with a neighbor even though his character be the direct antithesis o'f your own, if you have lived even* temporarily, in his personali ty- The educational significance of the drama must not be overlooked-. An au dience will watch with fascinated atten tion the unfolding of a dramatically pre sented truth that would prove much less •interesting told to them in any other manner. Statistics upon statistics, proof upon proof, fact upon fact, will not a- rouse the audience like the application to •their lives of the characters in a play they are watching.<query> what is the educational significance of a play</query> Through the medium of the play, they have seen the practical application of some truth to the lives of individuals like themselves. It becomes, therefore, no longer an abstract state ment, but something they have seen dem onstrated, a part of their own experi ence. Drama, then, serves a dual purpose. Of vast value to its creators and produc ers, it is also of incalculable worth to its audience, giving it a well-earned place in the recreational and educational phases of the cooperative movement. Little theater movements all over the country attest to its popularity. People like ""play acting,"" And so—on with the 'play! COOPERATIVES ON THE MARCH Washington, D.

September, 1938 REVIEWS Consumer Protection, Roger W. Babson and C. N. Stone, Harper & Brothers, New York, 207 pages, $2.50. This book by two members of Babson's Statis tical Organization, Inc., is not the kind of a book 'one might expect from a statistical organization. I The broad thesis is that the present system may be facing a death sentence unless something is done for the consumer. The purpose of this book, according to the authors, is to supply a handbook of the whole Consumers' Front. No single section of that battle front can assure victory.<query> who wrote consumer protection</query> The protection of con sumers call for a united thrust by all sectors; mer chandise reporting services, buyers' cooperative societies, consumer representatives at Washington, educational drives, pressure groups, alliances of consumers and business interests, and all other bona fide attacks on America's crucial problem, i In their attempt to weave all of the various forms of consumer action into one pattern, the authors coin the term ""consumerism"" and the i""Consumers Front."" They say ""The Consumers Front"" is potentially the most powerful material .force on earth. If education and organization can put that .power into action, it can surpass any other social change. Organized consumers can de velop a crusading zeal more ardent than that of communism. The use of these two terms, ""consumerism"" and ""Consumers Front"" bring vividly to mind some of the undesirable connotations of other ""isms""- and other ""Fronts."" I am afraid the program suggest ed by the authors may lead consumers into the ""ism"" arena where they may fall easy prey to clashing ideologies.<query> what is the consumer front</query> However the book is stimulating reading and almost everybody, even the reactionary business man will find in it many things with which he can agree. It is correctly termed a handbook for it covers everything from an excellent explanation of the various forms of inflation in Chapter I to the importance of training the members of the family to have three movements a day on page 198, while on page 130 the authors recommend a formula for a good mouthwash. I have the feeling that the authors have at tempted to please everybody. They tell about the bad in every good little girl and good in every bad little girl. At times the authors tend to scare people, urging them to prepare storm cellars and beware of the revolution. The farmers are told the city radicals may get their tentacles about them through rural electrification, county agent spies, and financial indebtedness.<query> what is the author's handbook</query> At the same time the city dwellers are told how quickly they could be starved into submission. City people are urged to get out into the country and by all means do not buy any property or even a business in large cities. Consumers are told to buy a small modern home but that the size of a house does not make a home. They are told to support chain stores but if necessary buy only from independents (rather than chains) in order to have the quality guar anteed. They are told to encourage mass produc tion but are also told that manufacturers are able to employ the ablest men — from chemists' to psychologists — to fool them. 143 Members of consumer cooperatives will enjoy the novel presentation of the Rochdale Principles and consumer cooperative development. They may question, however, the soundness of the suggestion not to ""Get together your friends and start a cooperative"" but ""Whenever you hear of the movement getting under way in your vicin ity, be sure to join it.""

Ewing, M. B. McAndrew, H. G. Lull, G. O'Geran, 32 pages, 25c It was a landmark in the history of education when the National Education Association present ed an official report on the cooperative movement. Here we have a report prepared by a group of educators showing the tremendous importance of the cooperative movement in the modern world. This report starts out with a brief historical sketch of the cooperative movement. It tells something of the different types of cooperatives. Next it takes up the development and present extent of cooperatives, both at home and abroad. The report shows how the cooperative movement has spread over almost the entire civilized world, and points out the fact that many of the most civilized countries, or probably half of all the families in the civilized countries, are connected with the movement.<query> who was the committee on cooperatives</query> The next section of the report states in simple and direct fashion the need for consumer coopera tives. It shows how the consumer is subject to ex ploitation and how the cooperatives Could remedy the situation. Then we have a very important section show ing how the cooperative movement can be dis cussed in the present school system. Suggestions are made as to how the cooperatives can be in troduced into social science courses, into history courses, into specialized courses of economics, into courses and problems of American democracy and in many other fields. Reference is made to the teaching of the cooperative movement in courses of contemporary civilization, in constructive Eng lish, home economics, general mathematics, agri culture, chemistry, health education, biology, physics, and other fields. A short section is devoted to cooperative edu cation in colleges and universities.<query> how cooperatives can be taught</query> Something is said about the method of organizing the coop erative. At the end of the report we have a most valuable list of sources of instructional materials. Altogether this is an exceedingly significant re port on the cooperative movement. It may add little to the knowledge of those already well in formed in the field. Its great importance grows •out of the fact that organizations embracing hun dreds of thousands of teachers have definitely discovered the need of the cooperative movement. The report will be used for a long time to come by those who want a concise and general state ment of the relation of the cooperative movement to education. Harold F.

Volume for the first nine months was a quarter of a million dollars greater than for the entire preceding year. Calculated on a nine month basis, the growth of the co-op wholesale has been 94%. Three new county-wide cooperatives have been organized and two other coun ty units are almost ready for operation.

They tell of the regimentation under dictatorship, the loss of liberty, the horrors of con centration camps, the race hatreds of anti-Semitism, the nationalizing of reli gion, education, government and business, the threats of war. Others busy themselves with aspersions on Russia. They describe the questionable confessions of the older leaders who have been shot to death, the sabotaging of production, the starvation of millions in the forced collectivi zation process, the failure to develop toward democracy, the suppression of religion. It is easy enough to make out a case for the Shakespearian conclusion, ""a plague on both your houses,"" and to convince hearers and readers that America wants none of either variety of dictatorship. But what about our own America? Are we so altogether perfect that we can spend all our time throwing stones at others' houses?<query> what was the shakespearian conclusion</query> Do we not live in a glass house ourselves? We call ourselves free, but what real measure of true freedom have we? How can we call ourselves free when there are ten millions unemployed struggling for the jobs of the employed and pulling down their incomes* How can we be free when we run the risk of losing our jots if we really speak freely our convictions on religion, education, politics or business, in case .such statements run counter to the predilections of the boss? How can we count ourselves free unless we axe able to leave one job and change to another? To hear and read most of the comments on Germany and Russia and the implied comparisons with America, one would assume that we are not economically regimented here by our monopolistic finance and industrial octopuses, wnen tue lacis are that we are also in the chains of economic dictatorships.<query> how can we be free</query> To the extent to which we are free we owe it all to our forefathers rather thian ourselves. They laid the groundwork for religious, educational and political democracy. They gave us the tools with which to fashion economic democracy as well. We have hardly used them as yet. Our economic conditions have gone from bad to worse and we have been largely ignorant and indolent about them. What reason have we to imagine we can solve European and Asiatic problems when we have not solved our own? The best contribution we can make toward preserving peace in Europe and Asia is to prevent poverty in America. We cannot preserve and extend democracy by war. It is eternally true that means and ends are one and the same. Peaceful ends cannot be accom plished by violent means. We tried twenty years ago to preserve democracy by war and only reaped a harvest of dictatorships.<query> what is the contribution we can make toward preserving democracy</query> The first result of an other war to save democracy would be dictatorship in the United .States. The pattern has already been prepared. No one need be fooled this time. It is all written out in black and white in the Sheppard-May bill. The day we de clared war against another nation we would also decree Fascism upon our own nation. Horrible as are ,the happenings in Germany and Russia, it is time we dis carded our ""Holier Than Thou"" attitude and our egostical complacency and faced the horrors of poverty, unemployment, tenancy, disease and crime at home. Our job is to make America a land of prosperity for all. When we have done that, then other peoples will themselves throw off their own yokes and begin to emulate us. Our job is to make America a beacon light of eco nomic liberty and equality.<query> what was the result of the sheppard may bill</query> That is our obligation to the world and the best H6 Consumers' Cooperation contribution to peace which we can make. Let us show other nations that we can eliminate our own economic greeds and race hatreds among ourselves. We do not ourselves have now a true pattern of economic democracy to force upon other peoples even if that were the way to do it. And when we fashion a true pattern of economic democracy for ourselves, we will not need to use force to influence others to follow our example. Truth is self-propa gating. Others will follow if we but show them the way to plenty and peace at home. But we must move faster! Every new .cooperative that is organized,, and every addition of new members or of services to members in older co operatives is a step toward bringing plenty to all and peace on earth, both at home and abroad.<query> what is the role of consumers in economic democracy</query> The Oklahoma Medical Society wanted the case tried before the State Board of Medical Examiners. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma, however, has handed down a decision refusing to issue a -writ of pro hibition sought by the Board of Medical Examiners to prohibit the district judge from trying Dr. Shadid's case. As a result of the decision the Board of Medical Ex aminers will have to go before the district court to show cause why Dr. Shadid's license should be revoked. This decision will take the case out of the hands of the Medical Society. Toronto, Ontario—The United Farm ers of Ontario, -which recently became a member of National Cooperatives, Inc., proposed, the union of all the cooperatives in the Province in one association at its annual convention here November 24.

When I sat down at the Directors' table, one of the directors handed me a neat package which proved to be a type of cheese manu factured by that Wholesale. On the wrapper was a familiar emblem— CO OP. The director who had handed me the package said: ""That's what you fellows have taught us. One of the biggest paint companies in the United States recently asked per mission to use the CO-OP label. It is, of course, reserved for cooperatives only. Not long bade the largest manu facturer of tires began using CO-OP trade mark, without leave or license, and discontinued its use only after it was pointed out to them that they were infringing.<query> what is the co-op trade mark</query> At at recent meeting of di rectors of National Cooperatives, Inc., four letters were written to that many companies that were using the CO-OP symbol illegally. I don't know what the CO-OP trade mark is worth. It may be worth four or five million dollars. If I were to guess its worth, conservatively, I would place its value at a million dollars. I do know that it has every bit as much value as older emblems on which mil lions .of dollars have been spent. Co- October, 1938 Howard A. Cowden, President,- Consumers Cooperative Association, North Kansas City, Mo_ operatives have something here of great worth, and they ought to appreciate it. Not only that, but they should tell the story of the CO-OP label to cooperative members at every opportunity. Some of our people still believe that other labels should be kept on the same shelves, in service stations and grocery stores, with CO-OP label goods.<query> what is the value of the co-op symbol</query> I have never believed that. I shall continue to refuse to believe it so long as old-line companies are as eager to use the CO OP label as they are today. Getting rid of goods bearing other labels, and putting the CO-OP label on our shelves 100 per cent, is alto gether a matter of education. When, consumers see the need clearly of build ing volume for their wholesale, to per mit it to go into the production of con sumer goods, they will buy CO-OP. It's- the only way they can build something for themselves. It's the only way they can prove they were serious and well- intentioned when they became a mem-- ber of the cooperative. You've heard the story of the farmer who sold his farm and used the money to roam the world in search of dia monds.<query> why do people buy cooperatives</query> Oddly enough, the new owner of the farm found diamonds under the back porch. Let's be wiser than the first farmer in this story. We have a gem inj the CO-OP label. Let's build on this foundation an economic system which we own and control. 147 HOW U. S. CO-OPS BUSTED THE FERTILIZER MONOPOLY T James R. Moore, Editor Ohio Farm Bureau News HE story of the cooperative purchas- doing enough of the business to cause — ing of fertilizer by farmers through- competing profit business to reduce •out the fertilizer-consuming areas of the prices to a fair basis. United States by means df their own Cooperatives do not need a monopoly retail and regional cooperatives, signi- in a """"""' fies as expressively as any other cooper- .ative activity the scope and effectiveness of cooperative economic action.<query> how did cooperatives effect fertilizer prices</query> In this field cooperative purchasing has proved itself capable of establishing yardsticks. When first undertaken in field to bring down the gen eral price level and thus benefit all con sumers using .that commodity, whether they buy from a cooperative or from private business. Cooperatives in the fer tilizer areas have brought prices down by doing from fifteen to eighteen per cent o!f the total business. The Federal Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, the retail Trade Commission, in reporting its study price o!f fertilizer sold by all companies, cooperative and otherwise, immediately fell an average of eight to ten dollars a ton, while the price just across state lines of the fertilizer industry in 1922, states that the cooperative purchasing of fer tilizer was a more influential factor than any otlher in bringing down the remained at the previous level. Here we general price level.<query> what is the cooperative purchasing of fertilizer</query> (See chart comparing have a .specific demonstration of the abil- —•'— ~c lC—t:1-— —J l----1J-~ • • ity of cooperatives to bring down the general price level of a commodity by prices of 'fertilizer and building materi als).

THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION _| HUSTON THOMPSON ACTING CHAIRMAN J48 ness of the coop erative purchas ing olf fertilizer is to contrast the trend in the index numbers of fertil izer prices with the trend in the index numbers of building material prices. If we go back to the year 1920, when the cooperative pur chase of fertilizer was getting un der way, we find that the index price of fertilizer was 186, com pared to the building material index price of 205, both based on the average price from 1910 to 1914 as 100.<query> why is fertilizer important</query> In 1921 fertilizer dropped to 156 and building ma- terial also to 156. Consumers' Cooperation /Vt the present writing, in 1938, the index price of fertilizer has dropped still further to 102, in contrast with today's building jnaterial index price which is still the same, as 1921, or 156. Thus the average price of fertilizer, from1 1921 to date, in w;hich cooperatives transact the largest single volume of any organization or firm, has been reduced by thirty-five per cent, while there has been no reduction in the price of building material which farmers are only beginning to purchase coopera tively. The various regional purchasing co operatives in Ohio, Indiana, and Michi gan, and later in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, have banded togeth er and contracted for the total output of various fertilizer plants.<query> average fertilizer price</query> Recently the Farm Bureau Cooperative Association of Ohio and the Cooperative G. L. F. of New York purchased jointly a 100,000 ton fertilizer plant located in Baltimore, which is to be operated by a cooperative affiliate composed of representatives of both cooperative wholesales and which, is .known as the Fertilizer Manufactur ing Cooperative. Thus, cooperatives are now going fur ther in the economic process by getting into fertilizer production, and will be able to bring about further savings to fertilizer consumers. Having already es tablished a yardstick in the field of fer tilizer distribution, cooperatives are now in a position to perform a similar func tion in fertilizer manufacturing. OHIO'S ADVISORY COUNCILS A PROGRAM OF GROUP ACTION L. F. Warbington, Director of Education and Organization Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperative Association T EADBRS of cooperatives can well A-' afiford to spend time in discovering new techniques and methods of getting people to participate in their own pro gram.<query> what is the cooperative fertilizer industry</query> There is unlimited power in a small group that is aroused through thinking and planning together. The most necessary factor in a pro gram of adult education is an effective unit of organization. This unit must be comprised of a limited number of people whose interests are mutual and who meet and act freely in the homes of their neighbors where the atmosphere o!f hos pitality abounds. The unit must have a social as well as an educational appeal. These groups must consist of both hus band and wife in order to work out a uniform program of interest. They must not be governed by so-called ""super- leaders,,"" but eadh member must be placed in the position of leadership him self, and all must be of equal rank. The officers of such a group must not hold themselves above the members, although they may assume a little more responsi bility of the duties of their offices.<query> what is the most important factor in adult education</query> During the 'last two years there has October, 1938 been quite a bit df stress placed upon discussion circles to educate members of cooperatives. In our organization these discussion groups are called Advisory Councils. They are composed of 12 families who have common interests^ They meet for a purpose and have an. objective. The Purpose and Objectives of Advisory Councils Their purposes are: first, to become better acquainted and mingle with each other in their homes; second, to become more familiar with the cooperative move- ment and community life through dis cussion (a specific part.of the program is set aside for that purpose); third, to counsel together and then advise the or ganization and cooperative leaders what policies should be adopted, and what new fields of activities should be ex plored; and fourth, to place each mem ber in a more favorable position to par ticipate in the entire program.<query> what is the purpose of an advisory council</query> I pose some of Oerne's ideas. His book has caused much controversy in Sweden, just because of its cooperative nature. Oerne's early socialist training still affects his thinking. While he no longer entertains the fan tastic notion that the state can solve the problems of society, as he once did, still he retains a tender place in his heart for compulsory government. The reviewer thinks that Oerne is dn an untenable posi tion in his statement that a compulsory organiza tion, such as the state, always will be indispensable for the protection of rights and justice, for educa tion, and for the care of the sick. This very asser tion contradicts itself. However, the education and the thinking of cooperators goes on, and advances with the advancement of cooperation and Oerne is among the most advanced. Dr. J. P. Warbasse.<query> who is oerne</query> He described the cooperatives in Europe -which he visited last summer and pointed out the effect of the co-ops in solving the problems of poverty, unem ployment and tenancy. Agnes MoPhail, Member of Parlia ment, described Mr. Bowen's addresses as masterpieces of graphic presentation. Washington, D. C.—More than 2,200 families in New York own and operate cooperative apartments, according to a survey of cooperative housing just com pleted 'by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. The apart ments have an appraised value of $10,- 293,000. J2 The development of cooperative Ti ing in the United States has been thusT almost entirely in the apartment-h field; it has been concentrated in qre fe New York and has been restricted bv tlf large amount of capital necessarv t building. Of the 39 projects for whirl statistics are available, 35 are in Br t lyn, Bronx and Manhattan.<query> how many families own cooperative apartments</query> Each of these 12 families is assigned a month in whith it is to entertain the other 11 families, just a sufficient 149 number in most cases to fill their front rooms. Their officers consist of presi dent, vice president, secretary, treasur er and discussion leader. Officers may be either men or women. The ..program olf each meeting con sists of a business session, a discussion period, recreation and .refreshments. Suggested material for the discussion period is supplied monthly to the dis cussion leaders by the Educational De partment of the Ohio Farm Bureau. This material is distributed a month in ad vance so that the .participants will be prepared to enter into the discussion with proper information. The secretary keeps the State Office informed of their •activities by sending in carbon copies of the minutes of each meeting. In this way the strength and activities of one Council group are related to those of another T)y the redistribution of the high points or important actions to all Councils. '<query> what is the purpose of the discussion period</query> Participation — The Basis of Education The discussion material of a newly or ganized group should be of a very sim ple nature such as questions and answers built around the present program with which t'hey are more or less familiar. Tihey are eager to participate in discus sion on questions that do not require much study. Then once they learn to par ticipate in discussion, they will be led into deeper subjects which require more preparation. At the present time approximately 300 Councils are meeting and are discussing questions such as these: ""Distribution1— the Farmer's Problem,"" ""Our Coopera tives Will Succeed—If,"" ""Do We Learn to Live,"" ""Do We Need Our Neighbors,"" ""The Value of Credit Unions,"" ""Coop erative Refrigeration,"" ""Cooperative Medical Care,"" etc. Through this plan it is easy to discover new leaders devel oping.<query> what is the basis of education</query> Many times a meek member will •offer a suggestion that will finally blos- •som out into a plan, and that member is •given the realization of achievement. I might add that these groups have de veloped without the assistance of an outside leader. They have established •confidence in their own ability to dis cover their way through. We have also discovered that people 150 will become interested in a program if they are allowed to participate in the building of that program. Through that participation they become obligated to serve — an obligation which they enjoy How the Advisory Councils Grow Another important factor is their method of growing by involving more people in newly organized Councils. To each of the regular meetings are in vited two of the host's closest neigh bors who are not members of the pre sent Council. These visitors become ab sorbed in the program of the evening, and a desire is created for them to be come members of such a (unit, and new Councils are formed.<query> how do advisory councils grow</query> The new groups follow the same plan as the old Coun cils — that of meeting monthly in their respective homes. When a new program of the coopera tive needs the support of the people, these groups are very important. They discuss the proposed program and work out a plan of action. There is a growing desire among the officers of the Councils within a county to meet together for training along the lines of discussion, business, and future action. These meetings will be attended by some leader from the State Farm Bureau Cooperative Who will lend as sistance as a resource man. We expect to proceed further in Ohio and organize as many of these Advisory Councils as is feasible, and thereby strengthen the existing organization by keeping members informed through their self-help program. Again I cannot place too much em phasis upon the potential power that has not been developed among the peo ple.<query> why are advisory councils important</query> (Many think that action in our co operatives still rests with the leaders rather than with the membership. Let us, as leaders, fade into the background and allow this potential power of the people to come forth.

October, 1938 153 ORGANIZED WORKERS AND FARMERS JOIN HANDS AS CONSUMERS TN a cooperative recreation hall at •^•Dillonvale, Ohio, facing a drop cur tain on which was painted a scene of a man and woman hand in hand ""Facing the Sunrise of Cooperation,"" represen tatives of organized Workers and farm ers of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia joined hands as consumers on September 16-18, The occasion was the first Institute on Organized Labor and Consumers' Cooperation arranged by the Labor Committee of The Coopera tive League under the chairmanship of James Myers. The location was not only significant, since the host to the Insti tute was the New Cooperative Com pany (an early cooperative pioneer with both labor and farm members), but the program of the three days developed a constant series of dramatic events.<query> when did the first institute of organized labor and consumer cooperation take place</query> Two n projects are being developed in N&W York, the other two in Wisconsin. &W The co-op apartments in New Yo k have been built to meet almost every il come level. They range from an 8 apart"" ment dwelling to a twelve-story apart] ment house with a pent house and an eight-building, 730-apartment project Most apartments are 2, 3, or 4 rooms' The value of the apartments vary from $75 to $700, depending on the location or type, while rentals range from $4 per room per month to $12 per room per month with the single exception of one co-op estimating its rental value at $22 per room per month. In addition to operating the apartments the co-op associations maintain stores, milk delivery, laundry, electric power, summer camps, classes and recreation.<query> how much does it cost to rent an apartment in new york</query> Two labor representatives, Clinton Golden, director of the Northeastern Regional Steel Workers Organizing Committee of the C.

F. of L., opened the discussions the first night, with Dorothy Kenyon, member of the Board of Directors of Consumers' Cooperative Services of New York, as the third speaker. ""Consumers' Cooperatives and Labor Unions should go along hand in hand —they should grow together,"" declared Miss Kenyon. ""The making of a new society is in the Consumer Cooperative and Labor Union movements,"" said Mr Golden, while Mr. Warner emphasized that there is ""no neutral position as regards Consumers' Cooperatives, La bor Unions and Farmers' ' Marketing Cooperatives — we must favor them all.""

Delegates to the Institute on Organized Labor and Consumer Cooperation, Dillonvale, Ohio, September 16, 17 and 18 in Cooperative Purcha-sing in Ohio was then described by Murray D. Lincoln, Executive Secretary of the Ohio Farm Bureau Insurance Companies and Com modity Cooperatives. He painted with graphic illustrations the story of the growth of Ohio's great oak of Coop eratives with nearly ten millions of as sets, which had sprung from an acorn of ten thousand dollars planted in the Cooperative Movement less than twen ty years ago.<query> who was the general secretary of the cooperative league</query> How Ohio has developed Cooperative auto, fire and life insur ance, fertilizer, feed and petroleum dis tribution was told by the speaker who then asked his labor audience. ""Why do you have in your own hands the tools to fashion your own destiny and fail to use them?"" Also representing agri culture, R. N. Benjamin, President of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Coop erative Association, declared that lras farm people we have come to believe in Pennsylvania that we won't get very far as producers until the city consum ers of our products organize themselves into Consumers' Cooperatives."" Credit Unions were described as a type -of ""Cooperatives with membership limited to your group"" for the purpose of developing thrift and preventing le galized usury, by Louise McCarran, Managing Director of the Ohio Credit Union League. ; First on the afternoon program was Joseph Blaha, Manager of the New Co operative Company of Dillonvale since its beginning nearly thirty years ago, who described the story of its develop ment.<query> who is the president of the pennsylvania farm bureau</query> From Racine, Wisconsin, came Herbert Katt, Manager of the Racine Consumers' Cooperative, a comparative ly new association, .to tell in language that stirred the audience into repeated cheers of the conquering of the discour agements of their early months of pro motion and operation until today they have six gasoline outlets, a coal yard and grocery store, which did $200,000 busi ness last year. ""Seeing is believing"" as the audience found when they were then taken on a tour of the various de partments of .the Dillonviale Coopera tive. ""We are pioneering in education as well as cooperation,"" said Anthony Lehner, Education - Organization Di rector of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Cooperative Association, all of which was abundantly demonstrated when L. F. Warbington, Education-Organiza tion Director of Ohio Farm Bureau Co operatives, called upon each one in the audience to ""put their brains at work"" and divided 'them up into ten Discus sion Circles.<query> who is the manager of the racine consumer cooperative</query> Concluding the evening, the audience participated in various forms of Coop erative recreation, folk singing, danc ing and games, under the leadership of Lynn Rohrbough, Director of the Co operative Recreation Service. This was preceded by special singing and dancing numbers by local Cooperators and mu sic by the Dillonvale Cooperative band. Deep emotion was felt by lall as they foined together in singing in English and Czech languages the Bohemian Na tional Anthem ""My Homeland."" since many of the members of the local co operative are of Czech nationality and are deeply concerned over their native country. The laudience of 160 responded freely to a suggestion- to contribute to a fund to help promote similar Institutes at other points. A most fitting conclusion to the thref days' Institute was the address and dis cussion on ""The Ethics -of Cooperation and Unionism"" on Sunday morning by James Myers, Industrial Secretary of the Federal Council of Churches and Director of the Institute.<query> who sings the bohemian anthem</query> NOVA SCOTIA—MECCA OF COOPERATION ""C ASTERN Nova Scotia and Cape -I—'Breton Island were the mecca .this summer for 200 visitors from 24 states, 5 provinces of Canada, the District of Co lumbia, Alaska and the British West Indies who came thousands of miles to 154 Consumers' Cooperation October, 1938 study the methods and accomplishments of a program of adult education and economic action which is revitalizing the farming, mining and fishing districts of this Maritime province. Among the visitors were university 155 >i professors, teachers, Catholic priests, protestant ministers, foundation direc tors, doctors, social ""workers, cooperative educational directors and housewives. One party included fifty-five princi pals, professors and superintendents of schools completing their work in rural •education at Columbia University. Using the campus of .St. Francis Xavier University as their base they visited cooperative lobster factories, fish processing plants, blueberry canneries, credit unions, marketing associations, buying clubs and cooperative stores.<query> what was the purpose of the consumer cooperative program</query> They sat with Dr. M. M. Coady, Father J. J. Tompkins, A. JB. MacDonald and Alex S. Maclntyre, leaders in the Ex tension Department of St. Francis Xavier, and traced the history of the ""Antigonish Movement."" Then uniting their four tour parties, they took part in the Rural and Indus trial Conference which drew together a thousand Nova Scotia farmers, miners and fishermen on the campus of St. F. X. to discuss the foundations and ac complishments of the cooperative pro gram. The Right Rev. James Morrison, Bishop of Antigonish, declared in open ing the conference that where commu nism was rampant in Eastern Nova Sco tia a few years ago, the development of cooperatives and adult education has given the people better economic condi tions and renewed hope and as a result ""Communism in our province is as dead as Caesar's ghost!"" Dr. Tompkins, in his keynote speech, declared that adult education, the basis for the Nova Scotia program, must be co-extensive with and co-terminus with life.<query> who was bishop of antigonish</query> Representatives from Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia reported on the extension of the coop^ erative program to the other Maritime areas. In Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island, 142 credit unions, 42 coopera tive stores, 17 cooperative lobster can neries, 11 cooperative fish processing plants and 7 other cooperatives have grown out of the study club program which has characterized the extension program. The tour parties visited cooperatives in Larry's River, Port Felix, Canso and Little Dover on the Mainland; and Ju- 156 dique, Port Hood, Ma'bou, Grand Etanq Sydney Mines, Baddeck, Sydney, New Waterford, Glace Bay, Reserve Mines L'Ardoise, Louisdale, West Arichat and Petit deGrat in Cape Breton Island. A high point in the tour was the ded ication of the Arnold Cooperative Hous ing development under construction by a group of miners at Tompkinsville, Re serve Mines, Nova Scotia, at which Premier Angus L. MacDonald of Nova Scotia and other high government offi cials participated.<query> where is the cooperative lobster cannery</query> Tour members reported that farmers, miners and fishermen who were com pletely destitute a few years ago are now on the way toward economic self- sufficiency; that they have regained ownership of property and independence which had been taken away from them by the old order; and that through mu tual self-help they 'have found ways to raise their standard of living to double and triple what it was. In the village of Louisdale, for example, 65 of the 92 families in the community were on relief three years ago. Today no one is on re lief and the members of the community own their own co-op store, co-op credit union and co-op pulp wood association. An international broadcast from the conference, carried by the Canadian Broadcasting System and the Blue Net work of the National Broadcasting Company, told the story of the adult education and cooperative program of the ""Antigonish"" movement.<query> what was the antigonish movement</query> Rev. J. J. Tompkins, father of the movement; Ken neth Leslie, poet and journalist; Miss Ida Gallant, member of the Extension staff; and Rev. J. Henry Carpenter.

The resolution, approved unanimously by the convention, is as fol lows: ""WHEREAS, labor unions are economic or ganizations designed to increase the living standards of workers through obtaining higher wages and improving working conditions, and ""WHEREAS, Cooperative organizations similarly are economic organizations designed to increase the living standards of workers by lowering prices of goods and services t>y reducing profits and overcharges, ""Therefore, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Utah State Federation of Labor in its thirty- third annual convention assembled, does nere- by endorse the formation of ConsumertC°j operatives and credit unions, and urges in organization among organized labor.<query> what is the purpose of consumer cooperatives</query> We are re printing an article on ""Leadership Standards"" by Miss Neva L. Boyd, Deipartment of Sociology, Northwestern University, which appeared in ""Standards and Philosophy"" published by the Co operative Recreation Service, which explains the values of traditional games.) AMONG the factors which are of great influence on standards of rec reation are the methods of leadership and the quality of the content of the activities. Because of this latter fact, traditional games, the content of which challenges continued interest, are su perior to those in which ,one player is made the butt of the joke, or to those which have a 'catch' in them which, once discovered, renders the game of no further interest. Among the most excellent traditional games are the folk games of Europe, and the play party games -of America.<query> what is the role of leadership in traditional games</query> These as well as others have proved worth, left unchanged, and simply and clearly taught, give increasing pleasure with repetition. Indeed the enduring quality of any rec reational activity might well be one of the tests of its merit. The tendency to farce games, or to indulge in 'horse play' indicates a pov erty of ability to psychologically 'get into the game,' and unless one psycho logically gets into the game, he is not actually playing any more than the ac tor who fails to 'get into character* is acting. The best way to avoid such farcing in play is to select activities which challenge interest and tax, but do not overtax, the ability of the players. The tricks and show-off devices em ployed by some leaders for the purpose of 'putting over' their 'programs' are unnecessary, provided the activities are themselves of interest to the group.<query> what is the tendency to farce in play</query> October, 1938 Ellen Edwards Editor Moreover, such tricks and devices in dicate a desire on the part of the leader to direct attention to himself rather than to leave with the group recreational material which they may use repeatedly on their own initiative. In fact, a mark of good leadership is to avoid centering interest in the leader himself, and to di rect it to the matter which he is pre senting. Good leadership then, is some what dependent upon the leader's faith in the thing he is presenting. When the matter being presented is a recreational activity his own ability in execution, together with his enjoyment and his clear sincere teaching contribute much to the success of his leadership. Add to these qualifications the pow er to create the character of informal ity which is conducive to spontaneous interplay, repartee and nonsense, and social resourcefulness must almost in evitably result.<query> what is the mark of good leadership</query> * * * There is a great variety of folk games, songs and dances available for recreational leaders wishing to follow Miss Boyd's advice and provide a high standard of recreational activities. The most usable singile collection of folk games and dances is published by the Cooperative Recreation Service, Dela ware, Ohio.

The books -should be ordered direct. Recreational institutes, camps and training schools are now offering train ing for persons interested in securing s'kill in leading folk .games and dances. While it is preferable for a recreation- leader to have special training in teach ing these traditional games, a person can learn the fundamentals thoroughly enough by himself to teach the group. The leader should start with simple things and gradually move into more difficult things which make the group climb.<query> who wrote the book on folk dances</query> In folk .dancing about twenty minutes each evening should be devot ed to practice on steps. It is important that the tempo of the music should be slowed down only to allow the group to get the movement of the dance. It is better to keep the tempo up and let the people scramble. If the music drags the group will come to dislike the dance. It is safe to assume that the people will fall in naturally into a lot of the danc ing. If the leader can- get the game or dance going it will act as a merry-go- round and everyone will hop on. The leader must watch the group closely and when things are not going well stop and take tth-em more slowly. It is im portant to remember -that people have a right to flounder and wrestle with the problem rather than have a person who knows the answer drill the answer into them.<query> how long should a group dance</query> Folk games are fun and for that rea son it is important for the group to dis cover the fun the first time they are played. This depends a great deal on the leader who should ""know his stuff"" and know it well, The attitude of the leader will help to get the others into the same attitude and everyone will have fun.

Tomlinson (Editor's note: This article is an abstract of a amphlet of the same title written by Charles E. Tomlinson, publicity director of the Cooperative Wholesale Society, Manchester, in 1925.) ART and Cooperation are two forces working along parallel lines to the goal of perfection. The one is ideal: the other is practical. Each stands for social service. The artistic nature, like the co operative nature, is sympathetic. It can not live to itself alone; it must give pleas ure and inspiration to others in terms of art. True Art and True Cooperation can only spring from free and voluntary ef fort; and in their expression they are above nations. They may be, by circum stances of race and country, national in character; but in their essentials and in their ultimate they are international, no frontiers barring their progress, no creed narrowing their scope, no color blinding their outlook.<query> what is the difference between cooperative and artistic cooperation</query> October, 1938 REVIEW« ""Cooperative E by Dr. J.

Is Baler (jualified1 to write a pamphlet on the important subject of Cooperative Education than Dr. Warbasse. For more than twenty years he has been president of The Cooperative League and during all these years has been active as a cooperative educator and leader. The pamphlet, which comprises 20 pages and sells for 10 cents, is full of valuable suggestions on the subject of cooperative education. It starts with the terse statement that ""the Cooperative movement can go forward just as fast as it trains cooperators and no faster."" This is absolutely true, and should be realized by everybody who in any manner is connected with cooperative effort. Dr. Warbasse rightly stresses the need of ""pre- education"" of people before they enter into any cooperative business venture.<query> who wrote cooperative education</query> Says he: ""It is a false as well as dangerous theory that a coopera tive business can be started with a membership that does not understand Cooperation and that the members will 'learn by doing. '"" Study Circles Advocated Dr. Warbasse is of the firm conviction that group study in the form of so-called study circles furnishes the most effective way of educating a community in cooperation. I readily agree with Dr. Warbasse with one addition:» there should be some way of bringing the various study circles in the community into occasional contact with each other, as after all it is very essential! that people who contemplate organizing a cooperative busi ness, or who already have organized one, become acquainted with each other. Realizing the great importance of bringing all the participants of such study circles into action. Dr. Warbasse warns that ""no person who is looked upon as an authority should be a -member of a study circle,"" because the presence of an authority is apt to make everybody else timid.<query> who is dr. warbasse</query> His idea Is that in these cooperative study circles, the subject should ""go around and be enriched hy each participant."" This is undoubtedly very desirable. The foiowl- edge which an authority might .possess can al ways be present in the form of printed material —""that scares nobody!"" Stresses Need of Education Dr. Warbasse insists that every cooperative society should be regarded as an education insti tution. ""Education should always be in evidence .. . Education produces cooperative business; and cooperative business is educational."" Education is needed to promote a wider knowledge of co operative principles and methods. To conduct co operative education in the locality, an educational committee should be elected. ""The first duty of this committee is to educate itself."" He advocates that all cooperative societies of 5,000 members or more should have a full-time educational director.<query> what is the importance of cooperative education</query> It may be interesting. to note in this connection, that two of the Central Co operative Wholesale's retail affiliates, each hav ing less than one-half of this minimum: member ship, now employ full-time educational 'directors. 159 Education of Em/loyccs The pamphlet also vigorously stresses the need of educating the employees of the cooperatives. ""The store managers and clerks should under stand Cooperation so well that they radiate it in their conversation. They should realize that they are a vital part of a great and growing move ment."" Other Subjects Dealt With Many other educational subjects are dealt with in .the iDamphlet. as: Women's Guilds, Bulletin Board, Counter Leaflets. Entertainment and Rec reation. Parties and Picnics, Movies, Drama, Study Tours, Radio Broadcasting. Training of Experts and how to malke the cooperative society attractive to children are still other subjects brief ly discussed.<query> what is the importance of cooperative education</query> There is also a bibliography of books and ipamiphlets on Cooperation and Cooperative Education. No one interested in the Cooperative move ment and Cooperative Education should fail to read this pamphlet.

The ideal of Cooperation is beauty in living, the perfection of Hu manity.

THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR IT seemed a ""long, long way to Kan sas City"" to many cooperators when the invitation of Consumers Cooperative Association to be hosts to the llth Bien nial Congress of The Cooperative League was accepted by the Board of Directors at their meeting last spring. But it didn't proive to be so far after all, judging by the fact that 154 voting delegates and H alternates were in at tendance, together with 351 visitors, making a total registered attendance of 519, with others present who overlooked the formality of registering.<query> when did cooperative league start</query> Those w.ho were so fortunate as to make the long trip were more than amply repaid for the time and expense. They were able to renew and make many new personal acquaintances among cooperators from other sections of the United States. They attended the sessions of a significant Congress. And they also saw an outstanding example of what E. C. Lindeman once character ized as ""an outpost of economic democ racy in America."" Not only did delegates and visitors see first hand the quarter of a million dollar plant of Consumers Cooperative Association, which was built only a few years ago by a private independent petroleum jobber and purchased at bankruptcy sale for about 20% of that amount; but some also took advantage of the fact that the annual meeting of Consumers Cooperative Association im mediately preceded the Congress of The Cooperative League and accordingly arranged to go early and attend CCA's annual meeting as well.<query> what was the purpose of the consumer cooperative association</query> Hurrying from his own annual meet ing. Howard A. Cowden, president of Consumers Cooperative Association, to gether with Dr. James P. Warbasse, president of The Cooperative League, ""sounded the trumpet call"" announcing the opening of the llth Biennial Con gress of The Cooperative League in a national broadcast over the Columbia Network on Tuesday evening, just pre ceding the opening of the Congress on Wednesday morning. 162 As is usual, the retiring Board of Di rectors of The League met on Tuesday evening to approve the Congress pro gram, which they did with slight changes. They then elected the Creden tials Committee as provided by the Constitution and nominated the Com mittee on Committees and Nominations subject to the approval of the Congress. The Credentials Committee appoint ed by the Directors consisted of A. J. Hayes, general manager of the Central Cooperative Wholesale, Superior, Wis consin; Merlin G. MiMer, educational director of Consumers Cooperative As sociation, North Kansas City, Mo.; and Werner E. Regli, director of the Ac counting Bureau of The Cooperative League.<query> who is the president of cooperative league</query> After discussion, the Directors of The League approved a motion that dues paying regional associations be re quested to nominate a member of the Committee on Committees and Nomina tions. The following regional organiza tions were accordingly requested to nominate members of the Committee, which they did, as follows, the members nominated being later approved by ac tion of the delegates to the Congress: David E. Sonquist, Central States Cooperative League, Chicago, 111. Homer Young, Consumers Cooperative Asso ciation, No. Kansas City, Mo. Glenn W. Thompson, Midland Cooperative Wholesale, Minneapolis, Minn. Wm. Liimatainen, Central Cooperative Whole- sale. Superior, Wis. Anthony Lehner, Pennsylvania Farm Bureau Co operative Ass'n, Harrisburg, Pa. H. W.

James R. Moore, Farm Bureau Cooperative As sociation, Columbus, Ohio. Leslie E. Woodcock, Eastern Coopérative League, New York City. At the meeting of the Committee, Mr. Woodcock was chosen as Chairman and Mr. Moore as Secretary. Consumers' Cooperation The Congress Opens With the Congress nationally an nounced over the radio, as well as by months of prior publicity, and the ne cessary preliminaries acted upon by the Directors, an auspicious foundation was laid for the formai opening of the Con- .gress on Wednesday morning, October 12th at 10 A.M. in the Municipal Audi torium. Probably no previous Congress of the League was ever held in a more beauti ful room than the little theatre of the auditorium, where all but one of the main sessions of the Congress were held.<query> when is the coop congress</query> Registrations were taken in the large entrance hall where were also dis plays of literature for sale, a temporary post office for mail and telegrams, and a blackboard announcing the locations of the sectional meetings. The local Committee of Arrangements consisting of Messrs. McCulley, Jensen, Hill and others provided ample assistance in the way of stenographers and others from CCA's staff and were everywhere on the job at all hours handling the many details of the Congress with dispatch, efficiency and courtesy which elicited high appreciation. An extensive display of cooperative products, educational ma terial, posters, etc., attracted many of those present to the mezzanine floor during their ""off"" minutes from attend ing the sessions of the Congress and the many sectional and committee meetings. For the eleventh successive time since the organization of The Cooperative League, the Biennial Congress was opened by President Dr. James P. War- basse, who, after geeting the delegates and visitors present, introduced Mr. Cowden to present the Address of Wel come.<query> who was the president of the cooperative league</query> This was immediately followed by the President's Address. Both of these addresses as well as the other principal addresses delivered at the Congress will be found in condensed form in this Special Congress issue of Consumers' Cooperation. Greetings from cooperative and other groups included special letters and tele grams from Mr. H. J. May, secretary of The International Cooperative Alliance; Mr. George Keen, general secretary of the Cooperative Union of Canada; Mrl John Hofmann, executive secretary of December, 1938 the Workmens Mutual Fire Insurance Society; the Workmen's Benefit Fund and the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Sosiety whose Canadian representative, Mr. Fisher, was also introduced. Brief addresses were made by R. E. James, representative of the American Federa tion of Labor, officially appointed as a fraternal delegate by president William Green, and by Jacob Baker, president of the United Federal Workers of America, w.ho was officially appointed as a fraternal delegate from the Com mittee for Industrial Organization by president John L. Lewis.<query> who was the president of the united federal workers of america</query> The Congress was also advised that letters of regret had been received from the Credit Union National Association and the National Cooperative Council who were unable to have fraternal delegates present. Following the presentation of greetings to the Congress, delegates and visitors were introduced to one another by the groups to which they belonged. National and Regional Cooperative Programs The subject for discussion during the afternoon session of the opening day of the Congress was that of National and Regional Cooperative Programs. During the first half of the session three addresses were made on different phases of national and regional pro grams. Education and Legislation was discussed by E. R. Bowen, which dis cussion also constituted the Secretary's- Report. I. H. Hull presented the subject of Commodities and Services and M. D. Lincoln that of Insurance and Finance. Following the three addresses the general session broke up into three sec tional meetings which enabled the dele gates to discuss the subjects in a more thorough manner than in a single group.<query> what was the topic of the opening day of the congress</query> The purpose of the morning and af ternoon sessions of the first day, as indi cated by the subjects presented, was to start the Congress off with a broad vision of the big jobs which the Con sumers Cooperative Movement has be fore it. This was then followed by four sessions which discussed and acted upon the problems which had to be solved in order to accomplish the broad purposes of the Movement. During the first evening session the Congress tackled the big problem 163 (which is a far bigger one in the United States than in other countries because of our size) of The Form of National Cooperative Organization Best Adapted to the United States and the Relation of Constituent and other Cooperative Or ganizations to The Cooperative League, which was presented by A. J. Hayes and R. N. Benjamin. The subject of the Constitution and Financing of The Co operative League was then introduced by L. E. Woodcock and V. S. Alanne.<query> what was the purpose of the first evening session of the cooperative movement?</query> The story of Coopera- h°n is the story of Human Progress. Januarv, 1938 The Machine—Master of Man It has been said that the special func tion of the Nineteenth Century was to banish the picturesque. Certain it is that the greatest period of Art was in the Middle Ages. The masters and the men of the craft guilds held Labor sacred as the handmaid of Art. A piece of work was then a complete achievement of a man's own effort, an artistic accomplish ment, an expression of his individuality. Alas, the artisan is now no longer the devotee of Art, but the slave of Machine ry. Today the brain and the (fingers of the craftsman make not ""a thing of beau ty and a joy forever"" from out a shape less mass and dedicate it .to the service of the people. Everything nowadays is a mechanical creation, an aggregation of standardized parts. '<query> what was the purpose of the invention of the machine in the middle ages</query> Because this session had to do with policy making, the delegates remained in one body during the entire evening, and participated actively in the discussion of the two subjects, without, however, ar riving at any formal decision. Such discussions do much to clarify thinking and eventually lead to definite action in a democratic body such as the Con sumers Cooperative Movement. Retail Organization Problems The Congress upon convening on the morning of the second day took up the subject of Retail Organization Problems, following their previous 'discussion of the national and regional phases of the same general subject. The problem of urban cooperatives was presented by Herbert Katt and that of rural cooperatives by Carlos Palmer. Then again those present divided them selves up into three separate groups for discussion. One group covered the re tail problems of publicity and education, another of purchasing and distribution and the third of accounting and fi nancing.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative movement</query> Group Organization Problems That afternoon twelve affiliated and unaffiliated groups which have been or ganized formaMy or informally to pro mote different phases of the movement, met for several hours to discuss im portant problems. A quick survey of the various groups indicated great earnestness and good fellowship in tackling the problems of the group as is natural1 among cooper- ators. More than 250 attended the Coopera tive Banquet Thursday evening. Dr. Warbasse presided as toastmaster with his usual happy combination of coop erative philosophy and wit. Everyone 164 was given a wider view of the Move ment in hearing International Economic Cooperation discussed by Howard A Cowden. Willis J. Ballinger, economic adviser to the Federal Trade Commis sion, spoke, in his personal capacity, on The Short Cut to Fascism in America He stressed at length the necessity of free competition as the foundation of economic prosperity and for the contin uance of political democracy.<query> who discussed international economic cooperation</query> Some in the audience expressed their disappoint ment that the speaker, however, did not go further on the foundation he laid and felt that ihe might well have concluded with an indication of the power of the Consumers Cooperative Movement to act as a yardstick to checikmate monop oly and thus maike 'free competition a reality. Business Meeting of Delegates After two days of discussing programs and problems in general and sectional meetings, the delegates heard reports of the accomplishments of the various de partments and committees of The League and recommendations for fur ther action.

All of the resolutions presented (by the Committee were adopted by the Congress and are re printed in a later section of this special Congress issue. Next followed the report of the Com mittee on Committees and Nominations covering nominations for directors pre sented by L. E. Woodcock, chairman.<query> who was the chairman of the rochdale institute</query> It was first explained that the terms of office of the following six directors had not expired: V. S.

John Hofmann, Executive Secretary, Workmen's Mutual Fire Insurance Co., New York City. Waldemar Niemela, Eastern Cooperative Whole sale, Brooklyn, New York. James P. Warbasse, President, The Coopera tive League, New York City. Leslie E. Woodcock, Secretary, Eastern Coop erative League, Brooklyn, N. Y. The Committee then reported that the charter of The Cooperative League pro vides for fifteen directors and accord ingly nominated for three year terms the following nine persons who were duly elected, following discussion by the del egates: William Liimatainen, President, Centra!

Kazan and Mrs. Mary Long.<query> who was the president of the cooperative association</query> Immediately following the adjourn ment of the Congress the newly elected Board of Directors met in session and reelected President Dr. James P. War- basse, Vice President Howard A. Cow den and General Secretary E. R. Bow- en. Mr. L. E. Woodcock was elected Treasurer, succeeding M. E. Arnold who is now living in Nova Scotia. By special arrangement with the Post Office Department, it has been possible to omit the November issue and triple the size of the December issue and thus our readers are able to have in one is sue the proceedings of the Biennial Con gress as well as extracts from the prin cipal addresses, reports of the sectional meetings, resolutions, etc. Following this summary of the pro ceedings of the Congress you will now be able to enjoy reading extracts from the many addresses which follow. The milestones which Congresses of the League mark may not be altogether clearly visible to those who are present and are still more difficult to record in cold type for those who were not present.<query> who was elected president of the biennial congress</query> However, the indications of a greater participation in and support of the work of The Cooperative League by an increasing number of regional co operative associations, and the election of directors of the League equitably re presenting the membership of the move ment, should mean that the Consumers' Cooperative -Movement in the United States is shifting into high gear with the strong united support of all the member ship. 165 Broadcast over the Coast-to-Coast Network of the Columbia Broadcasting System, October 11. A PREVIEW OF THE COOPERATIVE CONGRESS COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLES *"" I 'HE Cooperative League, which will •*• open its Eleventh Biennial Congress tomorrow, was organized in 1916 when the world war was at its height. The purpose of the League was to federate the genuine consumers' societies in this country and to set on foot a national organization for the carrying on of co operative education and the promotion of the movement.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative league</query> The League today is a federation of the 1770 strongest and most progressive societies in the United States. It has steadily grown until these societies have over 965.000 members and do a retail business of more than $100, 000,000 a year. The influence of the League is not confined to its constituent societies. The whole cooperative move ment of the United States looks to it as the national center of cooperative edu cation and information. It is a member of The International Cooperative Alli ance, which is the federation of national cooperative societies of forty countries, having a membership of over 100,000, 000 people. These societies are organizations of consumers. Among the businesses which they conduct in this country are stores, restaurants, bakeries, medical service, banking, insurance, housing and many other useful services. Farm sup plies, such as petroleum products, feed, fertilizer, seeds, etc., are effectively manufactured and distributed to their members by these organizations.<query> what is the league of cooperative societies</query> Machinery, and not Man ""is the master of things."" And man suffers in body and soul under the domi nation of the Frankenstein of his own creation. The mission of Art is to inspire Man to take possession of himself, and the ministry of Cooperation is to help him to do so by teaching him how to become the master of the machine, the com mander of his soul. The Elizabethan Age was the most glorious art period in our island story; in fact, England with her Shakespeare and fellow dramatists, her Spencer and a ring of poets, her Bacon and other philoso phers, her school of native music com posers who still are masters of the madri gal, was then mistress of the world in matters artistic. The Victorian Age, the other brilliant period in the history of our country, saw the art li'fe of the people sacrificed to the twin gods of Mammon and Machinery, -with their profit-making, labor-saving, but soul-destroying doc-<query> what was the purpose of the elizabethan age</query> In the United States it is not in the towns among the industrial workers but in the country among the farmers that the consumers' cooperative movement is the strongest. The farmer had formerly thouqht oif himself as a producer inter ested in .high prices of farm products. He has now discovered himself as a con sumer interested in low prices of every thing he consumes. And he is organizing himself accordingly. Through his con sumers' societies he is developing under standing of the common interests of all 166 James P. Warbasse, President, The Cooperative League of the USA consumers, and is coming into the towns with his cooperative societies and invit ing the urban workers to join with him to their mutual advantage. The cooperative societies are slow ly building up in this country a substan tial kind of business, in which invested capital is safer and employment more se cure than in the more prevalent method of business.<query> who is the president of the cooperative league of the united states</query> They represent self-help el evated to the level of mutual aid. Neigh bor joins with neighbor putting together their resources of capital and patronage, to conduct businesses, not for the pur pose of making money from other peo ple, but for the purpose of directly sup plying their own needs. The newest development is in the field of health protection. The consumer of medical, service has at last become con scious of his needs and possibilities, and is proceeding to supply himself more effectively with aids to health. He has realized that it is he who pays the doc tor's bills and does the suffering and dying; and he is taking in his own hands the organizing of cooperative health as sociations and developing 'medical serv ice in 'his cooperative societies for the purpose of making medical science more accessible to himself.<query> what is the newest development in the field of health protection?</query> In the United States this movement is non-political. It has won its way in competition with other business now1 for a hundred years. It is benefited by this competition. Unlike the prevalent busi ness system, in which such industries as banking, shipping, and the railroads, have asked for gifts from the govern ment to keep them going, the coopera tives neither ask nor expect govern mental subsidies. They would be dam aged by such favors. One vote for each memlber guarantees democracy of control. The difference be tween the cost price and the distribu tion price, called profit in other busi ness, in cooperative business is returned to the members in proportion to their Consumers' Cooperation patronage. This means there is no profit; the business is carried on for service. In many countries cooperation is moving ,0n toward becoming the largest and most .successful business.<query> what is the difference between profit and profit in cooperative business</query> In this country it is CO-OPS AT WORK TJRIBNDS: This is Cooperative Week JT in Kansas City. The eyes of the co operative world are looking this way. It 'began yesterday with the annual jneeting of Consumers Cooperative As sociation, which ended this evening. CCA is a wholesale owned by 424 co operatives in eight states. The real own ers are 120,000 consumers. Last year their retail cooperatives bougfht four and a quarter million dollars worth of neces sities through their wholesale. They •saved themselves nearly $91,000. To that must be added the savings they make locally, which comes close to $1,000,000 a year. Twenty-eigh't poverty-stricken weav ers started the Consumers Cooperative Movement in Rochdale, England, nearly 100 years ago. England has 45,000,000 people. Eight million of them are now members of 15,000 retail cooperatives.<query> how many consumers are in a co op</query> They balke one in every four loaves of bread; they retail one in every four bottles of milk; they employ some 300,- 000 workers at higher than going wages; they own close to $750,000,000 of capital, not one cent of which has been lost in the depressions since the World War. Their annual retail trade is close to $1,500,000.000. They pay back to themselves each year in savings more than $100,000,000. That's a lot of buying power to inject into the arteries of trade each 12 months in a little country like England. A similar story can be told about co operatives in Scotland. Little Sweden, which in recent years lias become the world's economic lab oratory, has 4,600 cooperative stores owned by consumers. More than one family in every three is affiliated with a consumer cooperative. Forty per cent of the population!<query> how much does a co op make</query> That's the land without a single anti-trust law; where the peo ple, through their cooperatives, keep prices in line by producing for their •own needs. The monopolies have to be- December, 1938 still small, but it is at least significant and promising. It grows and wins its successes as it demonstrates its effi ciency as a way of supplying human needs. Howard A. Cowden, President, Consumers Cooperative Assn. have themselves or see the business go to the co-ops. You'll find consumer cooperatives growing very rapidly in every demo cratic country. The movement itself is democratic. It is growing like Jack's beanstalk in the United States. It began on the farm. Today three thousand farmer-owned purchasing cooperatives do half a billion dollars of business a year. Oil and gas, two of the major items they handle, amounted to $110,- 000,000 in 1936.<query> when did consumer cooperatives start</query> Shareholders of the North Kansas City wholesale, which handled nearly 49,000,000 gallons of gasoline and kerosene last year, voted today to build a cooperative refinery— the first of its kind in the United States.. Leaders of this movement from all sections of the United States are ar riving in Kansas City now for the open ing tomorrow of the Eleventh Biennial Conqress of The Cooperative League of ' the U.S.A., which is the central educa tional agency of the consumer coopera tive movement in this country. The flounder of that League and its president for 22 years is Dr. Tames P. Warbasse, with whom it is any honor to share time on this iprogram. The Congress will not deal with theory alone, but for the most part w'ith what is being done actually to benefit men and women who work, whether in city or country. So I invite you to come to Kansas City and share in the economic discus sions.<query> who is the president of the cooperative league of the united states</query> If you can't do that, then watdh your newspapers for an account of this session, the news of which will be car ried to the four corners of the earth. And whether you believe in it or not, keep an eye on the consumer coopera tive movement. It is b'ig business now; it is growing; it will continue to grow. We may differ in race, color, religious and political views, but we can agree on one thing, I'm sure. We're all con sumers. Thank you and goodnight. 167 PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS WE are assembled here in Congress of The Cooperative League for the eleventh time in twenty-two years. When The League was formed, the ,world was gripped by a great war. It still is. The eternal war in the economic world goes on with little abatement.<query> what is the cooperative league</query> Man struggles against his fellow man; industry con tends against industry; jiation fights against nation — all for economic ad vantage, to get something away from somebody else, to get the difference be tween the cost and selling price, the profit. Of follow the examples of Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and Georgia. The re port of the National Education Asso ciation on Cooperatives was printed in a first edition of 35,000 and will un doubtedly greatly stimulate action on the part of schools to teach consumer economics. b. Members — An outstanding de velopment in cooperative education is the wider adoption of the study or dis cussion-circle method under various names. c. Employees, Officers and Direc tors — The Rochdale Institute, organ ized by The Cooperative League, is now conducting its third course. Re gional associations are conducting training schools covering week-ends, single weeks and several weeks.<query> cooperative education definition</query> Cor- Consumers' Cooperation respondence courses are now being started by other regional associations. d. Youth—New cooperative youth organizations are developing. It is to be hoped that others will follow. e. Printed Matter—In addition to cooperative leaflets, pamphlets and books, which combine publicity and ed ucation, there have now been published a large number of study-units or dis cussion-outlines. ' Cooperative editors and educators have held two very suc cessful and well attended annual meet ings in 1937 and 1938. 3. RECREATION The Cooperative Society for Recrea tional Education has held two annual ten-day conferences in 1937 and 193.8 where cooperative drama, music, danc ing and games have been studied by lectures, discussion and participation. 4. LEGISLATION Cooperative leaders must face more definitely the need for cooperative leg-, islation and for preventing the ham stringing of cooperatives by anti-coop erative laws and administrative rulings.<query> what is cooperative education</query> -13 J trines. The baser gold of trade and com merce became the currency of the na tion's thought and activities instead of the pure gold of Art. Competition—The Blight of Art The reign of Competition was ushered in with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and a blight fell on Art. The nineteenth century became highly mate rialistic. The spiritual life of the people, for which all true Art stands, began to revive, however, with the awakening of •the new democracy when voices were heard in the wilderness crying out the way of salvation through Cooperation. Competition truly is death—the death of all the highest motives in man—the anni hilation of the soul. Cooperation is life— the preservation of the noblest ideals— the uplifting of man to the heights of the eternal verities. Competition stands for fraud, deceit, ugliness.<query> what is the meaning of competition</query> A revised model state law, has been written by a committee, called together by the Department of Labor, which should be universally enacted. Nation al legislation and interpretations are driving a wedge between rural and ur ban consumers to the detriment of both. 5. RELATIONSHIPS One of the most valuable develop ments which is constantly on the in crease is the establishing of coopera tive relationships with democratic na tional consumer, producer and social organizations. The organizing of spe cial Committees on Cooperatives by the Federal Council of Churches and the National Catholic Rural Life Confer ence are specific instances in the ethi cal field. The apipointing of a Committee on Cooperatives by the National Edu cational Association is notable in the education field. In the political field, not only did the President send a special Cooperative Commission to Europe but at least four State Governors have pub licly endorsed the Movement.<query> what is the relationship between cooperatives and democratic organizations</query> There have recently been held significant joint meetings of cooperative marketing and purchasing leaders which have devel oped greater common undertakings and December, 1938 activities. We look toward the time when labor groups will far more actively be gin organizing their members as con sumers, as farmers did after 1920 and office workers began doing after 1929. The Consumers' Cooperative Move ment cannot isolate itself from other democratic organizations. The history of Europe shows that wie all fall to gether if dictatorships develop. If we read history aright, the attack of dic tatorship is first on democratic political organizations, then on economic, then educational and finally ethical. All these four great democratic organizations which society has formed over the course of the centuries must stand to gether or else they fall together. 6. ORGANIZATION Too many cooperatives in the United States have developed from promotion to organization, with the vital inter mediate stage of the thorough educa tion of the members being largely o- mitted.<query> what is the importance of cooperative organizations</query> Where education not only pre cedes organization but is continued as an integral part of the program, it is far more sound than organization only af ter propaganda. 7. PROMOTION Cooperative advertisements should carry cooperative educational messages as well as descriptions of products and prices. Each advertisement should be injected with cooperative idealism as well as commercial information. 8. MERCHANDISING Next to the management itself, the most powerful influence in cooperatives is that of the field force. Such field representatives should be thoroughly cooperatively educated and be des- scribed as ""educationad-merchandisers,"" rather than salesmen, so that their edu cational function will be always fore most and merchandising second. 9. PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION Cooperative education must lead the members into the desire and under standing necessary to advance from re tailing to wholesaling and on to pro duction. Regional managers must not fail to realize that they are not only responsible for the development of their own regional and retail cooperative as sociations below them, but also for the development of national and interna- 171 tional associations above them as well.<query> what is cooperative education</query> 10. REGIONAL AND NATIONAL COORDINATION a. Interpretation—The first prob lem in the national organization of Consumers' Cooperatives is the accep tance of a uniform definition and in terpretation of the Movement. All buy ing is a consumer function. There is no real difference between the purchase of farm supplies and family supplies; between vocational goods and house hold goods. As rapidly as we accept this correct interpretation, just so rapid ly will we be able to develop a national coordinated movement of all Consum ers' Cooperative Purchasing Associa tions in the United States. b. Commodities — In all three en terions of a successful economic sys tem, namely, volume, employment and investment, the cooperative movement is proving its stability. However, we will never have in the United States a real Consumers' Cooperative Move ment until we purchase family supplies as well as farm supplies cooperatively.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative purchasing</query> c. Services — The past two years have witnessed rapid progress in rural cooperative electrification. Cooperative medicine is now a matter of most seri ous and extended discussion with early signs of definite organization. Burial cooperatives are expanding. Eating and housing cooperatives on college camp uses are flourishing. d. Insurances — The significance of cooperative insurance, not only as a National and Regional Problems COMMODITIES AND SERVICES means of reducing the cost and increas ing the efficiency of the service, but also as the second line of finance, is be- ing more greatly realized. e. Finance — Our greatest weak ness today in the .cooperative move ment is the fact that we are underfi nanced in so many cases. This is prim arily due to the lack of education of the members of regional and retail coop eratives, who think too much of im mediate patronage returns rather than the greater future returns which will re sult ifrom building financially strong co operatives which can challenge and bust the trusts in America by setting up yardsticks which will lower the general price level.<query> what is the importance of cooperative insurance</query> CONCLUSION The knowledge of the power of the Cooperative Movement to lower con sumers' prices and increase producers' pay and thus to break monopolies and in the end eliminate poverty, unem ployment and tenancy, must be brought more rapidly to millions in America. We must learn as farmers and labor to cast our economic votes together. We cannot control what we do not own. The only way to ownership is by buying and banking together in our own cooperatives. ""The people are forbidden to rest,"" says Henry D. Lloyd, ""until out of their suffering a new liberty has been won —the industrial liberty, for which po litical, (educational) and religious lib erty wait for their full realization."" O OCIALLY the cooperative way is so <-) eternally right that so far as I know it is n'o longer challenged.<query> what is the cooperative movement</query> From the political standpoint people are coming more and tmore to recognize the need of •democracy in business as a training ground for .citizenship in the democratic state. In economics boolks our colleges are coming frankly to recognize the defects in cur present way o'f doing business. 172 I. H. Hull, President, National Cooperatives In the book ""Applied Economics"" by Bye and Hewett we read ""Capitalism is not wholly a success. We cannot view our industrial system with perfect complacency. It still has many defects •which need to be remedied."" Cooperatives Produce Desirable Goods It is clearly indicated that the under lying factor involved in the production and distribution of useless goods is the profit motive in business. In a coopera- Consumers' Cooperation tive there is no incentive for the mem bers to make or sell themselves any but useful goods.<query> who was president of the national cooperatives</query> Cooperatives Produce Abundance Much can be said for our present sys tem of business as to its ability to pro duce abundance. However, the abun dance of goods produced and distributed depends upon the ability of the consum ing public to absorb that production. The cooperative system should ma terially aid in the abundance of wealth created. That is exactly what is hap pening in Sweden and some of the northern European countries. The ac tual per capita production of wealth for poor Sweden in 1937 was higher than it was in the United States in spite of all our vast and unlimited resources. This resulted from the fact that they tad a better distribution of buying power brought about by their coopera tive enterprises. Cooperatives Increase Efficiency I Our present system of business has been reasonably efficient. There is less ithat we could hope to do in the way of •increasing manufacturing efficiency than in distribution.<query> what is the role of cooperatives in the production of wealth</query> However, the coopera tive system should stabilize production and thus increase efficiency. The profit system knows no conscience and future generations will refuse to admit that the system which destroyed the nation's natural wealth was efficient. The only answer we know for this waste is to bring the profit motive into subjugation to the general welfare through coopera tion. Cooperatives Distribute Incomes Widely It is true that the masses of our peo ple ihave shared p'ai'tly in the benefits of our increased production. Yet we 'h'ave a striking contrast between riches and poverty—incredible luxury and un believable poverty. Our income is not as widely diffused as it should be. Therein lies our challenge. Coopera tive methods have not thus far per formed in such a manner as to command the respect and confidence of those who are looking f/or the answer. If we study our own performances in the last , 1938 few years, our own relationships and the results obtained, we cannot criticize too severely those who still wonder where we are ^going.<query> why do cooperatives distribute incomes</query> Cooperative Weaknesses Spotlighted Let us turn the spotlight on ourselves. We have had much to say about eco nomic demiocriacy and yet our coopera tives do not cooperate with each other 'as well as do profit business groups. Our organizations who claim a mo nopoly on the word ""cooperation"" re fuse to cooperate with each other and war upon one another in the m'osr deadly fashion, using cut throat tactics to hinder each others progress. Preju dices have been built up between farm ers and laborers so that they d!o not wonk well with each other in an eco nomic organization where both are needed to build a sound successful en terprise. Religious creeds divide us without reason. We challenge the right of producers organizations to use 'the term ""cooperatives,"" when there can be no effect which could be accomplished by sudh a controversy except to an tagonize certain groups that ought to become part of a great all inclusive movement.<query> what is cooperative demiocriation</query> Cooperation is the very antith esis of Competition, and so is at one with Art, which stands (for honesty, truth and beauty. Art, therefore, has its definite place in the Cooperative Movement; and the importance of the cultivation of art- should be recognized in cooperative edu cational work equally with instruction in the matters of science which concern the more materialistic side of our activities. Cooperation Restoring Civilization Art and Cooperation seek not to make profit, but to bring joy into life. Coopef- ators! we say we want the best in every thing. Let us prove our words. Our home should be a treasury of things beautiful. Let us have the most artistic furniture of cooperative production that our means can afford, instead df the monstrosities in wood and iron that oft encumber our dwellings. Let us make our homes pleas ing to the eye with wall-papers of artistic merit and pictures that cheer and inspire.<query> what is cooperative art</query> The economists point out that in the long run there is no such thing as conflict of interest between the producer and the consumer. The prob lem of a business system: is 'to get both of these groups to recognize their inter dependence 'and the feet that the pros perity of eadh primarily depends upon the prosperity of t'he other. We have serious splits over definitions and terms. One group thin'ks of the Cooperative Movement as reformed capitalism. An other group thinks of it as a breaking down of capitalism. Personally, I think of cooperation as a reformed capitalism. If you think differently ell right. So long ias we leaders continue to base our judgment exclusively on prej udices or emotion, we are not yet fit for the positions of responsibility which we ihold. The thing which we refer to as a Cooperative .Movement and which we like to thinfk of as an economic system is so loosely bound together that we really should refer to it as 0 coopera tive hodgepodge which consists of a 173- considerable nuimiber of really substan tial units.<query> what is the cooperative movement</query> Let us admit im'mediately 'that fis yet the (movement is very loosely bound together on a nation-wide basis. Let us admit that to a certain degree this weakness is largely brought about by the weakness of the leadership. Let us admit that we have largely failed to accumulate adequate reserves in a centralized ibody which would make possible the (financing of a powerful economic unit. Let us admit that even our strong regionals and locals in many instances have honeycombed the busi ness structure by adopting unsound policies such as .credit trading, etc. We shall never 'have a central organ ization with adequate power and au thority until we have a central financial institution, in which we have all placed our resources, wlhich may conduct in surance or banking services or eventu ally (become a producing unit for the products which we distribute.<query> why is the economy weak</query> Having bu'ilt up (a substantial centralized capital and having all become partners in that centralized institution we could then gradually vest definite authority in the hands of someone in that institution to proceed to act for the member units. Education of Leaders Needed Perhaps the first step toward this sort of a program should be something of an educational progräm and revival among the leaders of the 'movement. We have talked much about an educational program among *the members but just now the thing that keeps us from get ting together Is not so much the fault of 'the meimlbership as it is the fault o'f the leaders. We are all so jealous o'f our own separate capital structures tha't we refuse to unite with those of other groups. We are so shortsighted that we cannot see that the uniting of our funds will 'give strength to all by cementing us to each ot'her. .<query> what is the first step toward a centralized capital</query> Before long we shall need some sort öl a super organization such as exists in Denmark and Sweden which does ,not limit itself to any type of coopera tives, or any one philosophy, which in cludes in its membership both producers' and consudners* cooperatives, which •helps to work out ,a plan of action •wherein those various groups can work with each other. The enemies of the movement have no fears as long as we scatter our iforces. Today we need have no fear of those enemies ol the move ment who are on the outside. The ene- m'ies we should tfear are those termites wihich Work ifrom within. They are deep in the hearts and m'inds o'f our leaders. They comprise shortsighted-selfishness and pride, prejudices and (bigotry which keep us |from uniting our resources and our power and cause us to falter and fumble in nebulous confusion.<query> what is the enemy of the movement</query> I am afraid only 'of those things -which keep us apart and prevent us from crystal- 'izing our objectives land concentrating our imight. We have been marching through 'the wilderness and one day we shall enter the promised land. But before we cross over, it will be required that every one ol our leaders either purge themselves or else step .aside for Joshuas who have grown up in the movement, -who neither fear the giants without nor tlhe doubts within and who iwill imarch out with a determined resolute irresistible oneness of purpose to keep ifa'ith with those who have trusted 'them. National and Regional Problems COOPERATIVE INSURANCE AND SECURITY TNSURANOE is one of the few ways •*• we have of providing ourselves with security against financial loss, loss of property, and loss of income. It is the one certain method by which people with low incomes can create some sort of a material estate.<query> what is tnsurance</query> Insurance is prob ably the most natural o'f all economic 174 Murray D. Lincoln, Secretary, Ohio Farm Bureau Cooperatives activities for cooperative organization. Basically, insurance is simply 'the banding together of a group to provide against contingencies—against losses incurred by death — each individual placing in a common .fund a sum suf ficient to meet these contingencies as they arise. This imay be passive cooper ation, as in the case of a private stock company, or it may be active and dem ocratic cooperation, as in the case of a true cooperative. Insurance constitutes for eighty-five per cent of the population the only form of material estate they possess. And on the average this estate is large enough/ to provide only for funeral expenses and last illness expenses of the breadwinner, leaving 'the family destitute when he passes on.<query> what is the definition of insurance</query> It is well, therefore, that we look into insurance 'to see to it th'at the insurance the averaige individual carries gives him the utmost security for his money. Greater Protection at Lower Cost The first justification for cooperative insurance is a reasonable certainty that it can improve upon the service, quality, or cost of insurance protection. The Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, with which I am most Ifamiliar has prown from a small company with ,$10,000 of assets in '1926 to (the fifth largest of its kind in the, country. This growth took place in the face of the keenest competition, and during a decade of which five vears were years of business depression. Even more significant, the premiums charged when the coooerative began operations were about forty per cent lower than stock company rates. Today .savings on some policies run as hiqh as fifty per cent, and it is conservatively estimated that in a sinqle vear this tvoe of insur ance saved the farmers of Ohio millions of dollars.<query> why is cooperative insurance necessary</query> Claim service of the company is as prompt and fair as that of any company opera'tinp in the territory, which in cludes Ohio, Pennsylvania. Marvland, West Virpinia, Virpinia, North Caro lina, New York, Vermont, and the Dis trict of Columbia. Claims paid to policy holders during the last 'two years amount to about four million dollars, which represents the extent to which the security of these people was pro vided for, Attacking Monopoly Control Dr. E. C. Lindeman 'has estimated th'at one per cent of 'the people own fif ty-nine per cent of the wealth. Studies of the Brookings Institution disclose that one-tenth of one per cent of the people in the highest income classes re ceived as muc'h income as forty-two per cent of the people in the lowest income classes. The 'result of this .great concentration of wealth and income has been the ac cumulation of vast economic power in the hands of a relatively few individ uals.<query> what percentage of the population owns the world's wealth</query> Another result of this concentration of economic power was pressure on all types of business to produce more .sales than the people could support. Conse quently there was, and istill exists, a great over-selling of all types of good's and services Iby the 'use of high-pressure methods, super-salesmanship, install ment credit and expensive advertising devices of all kinds. Insurance /was included in this drive for greater returns on invested c'apit'al. The extent to which insurance was oversold is indicated iby the ifact that, of all insurance written, only 17 per cent ever matures. This means that eigh'tyj three per cent of all insurance is lapsed or cashed in with the polityholder never receiving the protection he bought. The (financial control of insurance over our everyday 'activities extends still further. Insurance companies have grown until they are the secondary fi nance system of the United States.<query> what is the extent to which insurance was oversold</query> Through the tremendous investments which insurance companies have in stock business, they control a much larger portion of business and industry th'an imany of us realize. The members of one firm alone hold thirty directorships in ten insurance companies holding total assets of three billion dollars. These in turn hold three hundred forty-one directorships in one hundred twelve corporations having total assets of twenty-two billion dol lars. This is a vast (amount of money, but when we consider the influence of such sums over all the corporations with which these interests are ""connected,"" it is almost impossible to realize the significance of the ramified control they exercise over the corporations that serve us. Consumers' Cooperation December, 1938 In addition to utilities, banks, rail roads, and insurance companies, these holdings ,give one firm control over 175 many of the 'corporations which sell farmers farm supplies and farm .equip ment.<query> how much control does insurance have over corporations</query> Let us go forth to our work and pleasure clad in garments of taste and style. Let our needs for entertainments be minis tered unto by means of refinement. Let us keep our lives 'bright and our memories sweet with festivals, anniversaries and pageants. Let us make the refreshing in fluence of art ifelt not only in our cooper ative societies but in the wider coopera tive organizations, our municipalities.

Cooperatio is the practical means towards that encf The one is aesthetic; the other is ethical The cooperative estimate of humanity means a new outlook on li'fe—on the in dividual and his relations to the family to the community, to the nation, and to the world.<query> what is cooperative</query> M'any of these firms ,are buyers of farm products. Others are corpora tions selling manufactured goods to farmer's. Many of these companies are financed by insurance institutions with money that has been paid in premiums by the eighty-five per cent to make further profits from them. Democracy in Business Through cooperative organization .of insurance, cooperators control their own finances and thus are assured of control of their own enterprises. Only in this way can 'democracy be made to work in business. Since the policyholders of the Farm Bureau (Mutual Auto Insurance Com pany own .their company, they .control the investment of their own accumu lated reserves. These reserves have provided the necessary capital to or ganize a cooperative fire insurance company, and to buy the controlling in terest .of a life insurance company. Another 'portion of their reserves was invested in the Ohio Farm Bureau Corporation, ;which in turn provided the capital for two cooperative service or ganizations, the Farm Bureau Cooper ative Association and the Farm Bureau Agricultural Credit Corporation.<query> what type of organization is democracy in business</query> These cooperative insurance com panies ,now miake mortgage loans to in dividuals and to cooperative associa tions. They have furnished the member ship ""organization, 'the Ohio Farm Bu reau Federation, and affiliated organi zations with 'a home for their rapidly expanding activities. They have con tributed hundreds of thousands of dol lars in the last eleven years for educa tional and promotional activities along general economic cooperative lines. Wage-earners and Farmers Under-insured In the United States, eleven per cent of the heads of Working class families carry no insurance at 'all, and those who are insured have taken out inade quate policies. One out of every four wage-earners has either no protection at all, or a policy the .value of which is less than $500; and three .out of four 176 have policies for less than $2000.<query> what is the cooperative insurance</query> The average insurance figure is only one- fourth of iwhat might be called an ade quate amount. Insurance is of greatest importance for farmers and .wage-earners, because these groups are Jess prepared for emergencies and contingencies than other classes. When death ior illne'ss comes, there is not much in the way of savings to fall back on. The high percentage of -lapsed poli cies is another indication of the failure of existing institutions to do an ade quate 'job. Ou't of a total of 23,500,000 policies taken out in this country in 1929, 2,- 441,000 were surrendered -and 6,523,- 000 lapsed, making a total of surrenders and lapses of 8,964,000 in one year. This took place in spite of the fact that 1929 was the most prosperous year in our history. Cooperative insurance makes possible the insurance of the lower income classes at reasonable rates, by decreas ing the premiums charged.<query> what is the average amount of insurance</query> The savings made in cooperative automobile insur ance have already been .noted. In the Cooperative Life Insurance Company of America, the life insurance affiliate of the Ohio Farm' Bureau, the rate for an ordinary life policy at age thirty-five is lower by seventeen per cent than the prevailing rates of ten large competitive companies. Cooperative insurance improves the bargaining position of its members and defends them /from the profit-making of privately-owned insurance companies. It also has a ^beneficial .effect on the general condition of insurance by forcing competing insurance com panies to reduce rates and im'prove policies. Advantages of Co-op Insurance Cooperative insurance is built on a democratic basis, each member having one vote in the (general meeting of the company, and participating in the gen eral management (by electing the board of directors and officers of the com pany.<query> what is the benefit of cooperative insurance</query> This is the vital distinction from private insurance companies. Some of the private companies .return to the p'olicyholder a part of the profits, but hardly 'any of them give 'the insured a full share in the management and con duct of the business. The method of distribution of profit is another test of whether an insurance company 'is cooperative in character. In cooperative insurance, members receive a limited interest on capital—if any capital has been invested—and the sur plus or earnings, is distributed among the policyholders in proportion to their contributions to the creation of the earnings, or in the form of lower rates. Cooperative insurance companies, to gether with credit unions and coopera tive ban'ks, can go a long way in help ing consumers to get reasonably priced credit. By inventing their funds in co operative purchasing, marketing, hous ing, trade, industry, and in mortgage loans to consumers, cooperative insur ance companies can play a prominent part in furthering the development of the whole cooperative movement and thus render further service to its mem bers and policyholders.<query> what is cooperative insurance</query> Cooperative in surance institutions and cooperative banks are coming to be the main foun dations of the whole cooperative sys tem. Discussion INSURANCE AND FINANCE TH'E discussion in the sectional meet ing on insurance and finance settled down after a few minutes to the ques tion of credit trading and credit institu tions for the Cooperative Movement. First we discussed the danger in retail credit and finally passed a definite reso lution as'king that tihe Congress go on record as against all retail credit, specif ically making the suggestion that credit unions be set up to give the credit that 'may be required by individual cooper ators thus taking the store manager out of the credit giving, banking function. •• The other definite decision on the part of the group meeting was a recom mendation that the Congress as(k the ap pointment of a comlmittee to study the establishment of nation-wide credit fa cilities for the use of Cooperative so cieties and wholesales and for the es tablishment of such facilities once the best method has been decided upon.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative banking</query> The content of both of these decisions was passed on to the Resolutions Com mittee at the Congress. L. E. Woodcock, Chairman Consumers' Cooperation December, 1938 Discussion EDUCATION AND LEGISLATION TN order to allow maximum participa- •*• tion the discussion meeting on Edu cation and ' Legislation voted to break into six discussion .groups and deliberate on the two questions which it was felt constituted the major problems on this aspect of cooperation. 1. ""From an organization standpoint, what is the most effective method to apply to an educational program in a cooperative?"" 2. ""What program of action can 'be put into effect in a cooperative that will result in the greatest participation of the people?"" The groups met for more than an hour and then came back for a joint session. Secretaries for each group summarized the results of each discus sion with the following results.<query> what is the most effective method to apply to an educational program in a cooperative?</query> In an swer to the problem, ""From an organi zation standpoint, what is the most ef fective method to apply to an educa tional program in a cooperative?"" these methods were suggested: 1. Group discussion by the members on an or ganized basis. 2. Adequate publicity programs headed up by a functioning committee. 3. Use of the radio where ever possible. 4. Personnel well trained in how to apply the educational program among the people. 5. Urge the cooperation of existing organiza tions within the community to influence the general attitude toward a cooperative pro gram. In answer to the problem, ""What orogram of action can be put into ef fect in a cooperative that will result in the greatest participation of the peo ple?"", the consensus of opinions was: 1. It was the opinion of the group that the leaders be more interested in placing people in a position to 'think and plan together—the small group idea was suggested.<query> what is the most effective method to apply to an educative program in a cooperative?</query> 2. Adequate displays of 'goods offered by the cooperatives. 3. Efficient employees who are very attentive to patrons, and who stress service rather than selling. 4. Regular personal letters from the manage ment to stockholders and patrons calling at tention to the activities of the cooperative. In summarizing the group meeting Merlin G. Miller, educational director of Consumers Cooperative Association declared that the need of the moment is: improved leaders, trained personnel, and the organization of people in small groups to thinlk, plan, and build their cooperatives. L. F. Warbington, Secretary 177 I t Retail Organization Problems RURAL COOPERATIVES THE success of any cooperative de pends largely upon the solution of certain fundamental problem's that must •be squarely faced and solved in a ration al manner, considering of course the con ditions found in the community.<query> what is the need of the moment</query> I shall confine what I have to say to Indiana rural cooperatives witih which I am more or less familiar. Problems Facing a Rural Co-op Accurate accounting, with monthly fi nancial and operating statements for the use of the management and board of di rectors plus semi-annual audits are ab solutely necessary to safely guide the affairs of any cooperative. Our auditing problem is largely solved by the auditing department of our cooperative whole sale which renders valuable service to the retail cooperatives in securing com petent accountants. Adequate finance is one of our prob lems. Paying rebates in share capital, thus leaving the earnings for use as operating capital is p-retty generally in vogue. Our rural cooperatives are se curing a satisfactory and very helpful senvice from the Banlk for Cooperatives but had we antedated our cooperatives with credit unions and cooperative in surance of all kinds, our problems of fi nance would have been solved through our own efforts.<query> what is the problem of a rural cooperative</query> ""Industrial Conflicts — Strikes,"" by Charles C. Webber, National Council of Methodist Youth. 740 Rush Street, Chicago, 111. 15c plus 3c postage. This is a four section study unit written by the Secretary of The Methodist Federation for Social Service. It is primarily intended for church youth groups and includes a worship service in connec tion with each of the four lessons which cover (1) Why do workers go out on strike? (2) What happens when strikes take place? (3) How can strikes be eliminated? (4) What can young people do in strike situations? The Consumers' Cooperative Movement is sug gested as one of the means of eliminating strikes. The author is becoming well known among coop; erators for his strong advocacy of the Consumers Cooperative Movement in his addresses ana writings.<query> what happens when workers go on strike</query> The Cooperative Movement is a struggle, not against individuals or any class or party, but against a social system based on selfishness and working through competition. Our destiny is the Coopera tive Commonwealth, which shall have for foundation sure and strong the freedom of the individual to develop himself, in peace and through industry, for service in the common good. The Comradeship of Art and Cooperation Cooperation makes ifor the right under standing of life, and through its collective thought, has a culture distinctly its own. And why not an art? ""The conscious utterance of thought by speech or action, to any end, is art,"" according to Ralph Waldo Emerson. What better medium for an all-embracing effort? The earnest longing for the betterment of humanity, the glowing hope for the progress of the people, the fervent faith in the salvation of the world through cooperation, what inspiration is here for poets and painters, musicians and singers, architects and sculptors, orators and dramatists!<query> what is cooperative movement</query> Purchasing should not be a problem for a local cooperative. It is merely a question of ordering the needs of the so ciety from our cooperative wholesale. No manager has any right to expect any loyalty from the members of his own cooperative who does not purchase 100% from his co-op wholesale. The wholesale will make mistakes but it is the property of its members and with constructive criticism and help from tlhe retail managers can easily be made to render better service tlhan any profit motive wholesale. Patronage given the latter defeats the fundamental aim of our (movement. Extension of credit handicaps a num ber of our cooperatives. Many have 178 Carlos C. Palmer, President Noble County Cooperative Ass'n solved that problem by cash trading. In our local cooperative, at the end of tihe first sixteen months operation, a poli cy of credit extension nearly wrecked the enterprise but the substitution of a cash trading policy eliminated the worst hazard to cooperative success as well as the most disagreeable worry of our manager and directors.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative wholesale</query> Need for Greater Purchasing Power In distribution, the lack of volume is always an ever present problem and will continue so, until every family comes to believe that our present way of doing business is utterly incompetent. Proof lies in the fact that a great mass of ab- O'ect poverty may ibe found in nearly every American community while a fa vored few in the upper income brackets are allowed by our profit motive system to legally take the necessities of life away from tihe American producer and consumer. This leads to the cooperatives' biggest and hardest problems, that of coopéra tive education and publicity. There are tremendous obstacles to overcome but tlhe movement is equal to tlhe task. Institutions Protecting the Old System The press, both local and metropoli tan, goes into the great majority of American homes with the force of its propaganda defending the profit motive and the ever present system of exploita tion of the many by tihe few.<query> what is the problem of cooperative education</query> Our coop erative publications, entering such a small per cent of our homes, are work ing at great odds to combat this force of obstruction. Our national recreational program with competitive sports, the. moving pic ture industry, bridge parties, etc., acts as an opiate to prevent thinking about oui social and economic status and seeking a solution therefor. Our political parties, especially during campaign years lead far too many peo ple to believe that our government will solve all of our social and economic problems if we will give power to the Consumers' Cooperation . right political party. The plain fallacy of such belief is that we have had major economic depressions under administra tions of both our major political parties. Our public schools generally indoctri nate rather than educate. The text boo'ks are pretty well censored by our econo mic masters and as a result youth is .<query> what is the fallacy of political parties</query> trained in our schools to read and memo rize the things that will make them harmless citizens; harmless because of their inability to thirik for themselves and execute- a rational and peaceful change in our social and economic struc ture that now makes it possible for our national wealth to continue to con centrate in tihe hands of a few, while a third of ouïr people, are ill fed, poorly clothed and inadequately housed. All of the institutions mentioned wield a tremendous influence on the public mind so that it seems to me that not only rural cooperatives, but all coopera tives face a major problem of éducation. The Farmer Takes a Hand American farmers have made remark able progress in their marketing and purchasing cooperatives during the past score of years. The savings annually reach large totals. But when we con sider the comparatively small amount of farm products 'marketed cooperatively and the very simall percentage of farm er's .needs purchased cooperatively, then we begin to realize the great possibilities in the field of agriculture for coopera tive promotion.<query> what is the problem of cooperatives</query> How One Township Broke the Barriers The rural township in which I live is six miles square. Two hundred rural homes are located within its borders. For five years a group of families have met weekly during the fall and winter months discussing their problems, study ing dramatics and enjoying wholesome recreation. A couple of years ago this group made a study of tihe local conditions, comparing the present with fifty years ago. They found that there were the same number of homes in the township fifty years ago. At that time only seven of the two hundred homes were occu- December, 1938 pied by tenants and only a dozen farms were mortgaged. Today .ninety-three farms -are operated by tenants while one hundred seven farms are occupied by owners. Ninety-three were mort gaged. It was evident that in the past half century the residents of this town ship lost more than half the ownership of their land and that much of that own ership had drifted into the hands of fi nancial interests in metropolitan centers through their ownership of stock in in surance companies and Federal Land Bank Bonds.<query> how many farms are in a township</query> A similar situation exists in most rural townships in the country. Better Education—Better Business After three winters of these discus sion meetings the members of this town ship purchased twenty-three and one- half per cent of the total sales of the Noble County Cooperative Association during the calendar year of 1936, while the only other township in the same geo graphical position purchased only twelve and one-half per cent of the total sales. There are twelve townships in the coun ty all of similar size, * save one. The other ten townships purchased from three to twelve per cent each, of the total sales. Such are the sales results of a discussion, group when less than ten per cent of the families of this township participated. I believe the dominating motive with a large majority of the farmer members of cooperatives is that they market co operatively because they secure or ex pect to secure a better price for their product and that they purchase cooper atively because they secure better values.<query> how many townships in noble county</query> If that situation exists, and I feel sure it does, ' then comes the challenge to the leaders of farm cooperatives to change that motive to one of building a new democratic social and economic order through the cooperative move ment. The greatest problem of rural coop eratives is to change human behavior. To solve the problem I suggest a com paratively new technique in cooperative education developed with such great success by St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia. 179 Retail Organization Problems BUILDING AN URBAN COOPERATIVE ID ACK in 1934 we in Racine were con- -^scious of a defect in. our economic system. That consciousness first devel oped back in 1929 and through '30, through the terrible years of '31, '32 and '33. Because we felt that the unemployed had to have some unity of action in order to gain even the barest necessi ties of life we organized the unem ployed into groups to put pressure on the local relief set-up to get 'a more ade quate living, or at least more considera tion than they had been getting as in dividuals.<query> what is the greatest problem of rural cooperatives</query> To a degree this had some ef fect. It showed that organization could be of benefit to our working people. So gradually, seeing the effectiveness df organized action, we got the idea of 'building our own cooperative associa tion to distribute goods aimong ourselves to make our resources go further than they had in the past. Now the organization of a coopera tive is not simple in the rural areas and I think it is even more difficult in the cities. But it can be done with a lot of hard work, willingness to work. There is no reason why we .can't do a great deal bigger jdb in the cities than we have done. We've proved in the city of Racine that once it has been explained to the people they will organize in con sumer cooperatives. Birth Pains of a Cooperative We organized by .selling 300 shares df stock in our cooperative to various of our working class people.<query> what is the purpose of a cooperative</query> Now I thought that when we sold 300 shares, that would mean $3,000 in caslh to start operations. But I soon learned that that didn't ne cessarily mean. $3,000—the arithlmetic part of it was all right, 300 times 10 was 3,000—but when we came to col lecting it we found that wasn't true. So we scraped together about $1200 out of the proposed $3,000 and out of that we bought a tank wagon. We started in the gasoline business, leased a service sta- 180 Herbert Katt, Manager Racine Consumers' Cooperative tion and bought a little equipment, so that when we got started we had only enough to pay the freight on the first car of gasoline. Midland Cooperative Wholesale helped us a great deal. The farmers who organized the cooperative wholesale took a long chance, but Mid land Cooperative Wholesale had confi dence in our set-up, extended us the ne cessary credit and after the first 30 days we didn't have any trouble.<query> how much did midland cooperative wholesale cost</query> For the first 30 days we lost money but after that we consistently made a lot more money than any private bus iness could possibly have made undei the same set-up. There isn't any ques tion about tlhat. We developed from gasoline service into .coal. We set up our own coal yard. We found that by pooling our purchases on- coal and giv ing those orders to a private retail deal er that we were able to save about 75c a) ton, but after takinq a greait many or ders and making a few deliveries, the biq moqul in the coal business in the City of Racine said to the little dealer that was selling to us. ""you can't sell those fellow.s any coal; if you do why we'll out you out of business."" So we couldn't buy any coal from him.<query> how did coal companies develop</query> Art and Cooperation, in glorious com radeship, stand for grace in thought, gra- ciousness of speech, and gracefulness in action, and so will make life sweeter and nobler, because animated by that unify ing energizing principle. ""Those who desire,"" declared Water Crane, ""to 'build up a larger and fuller human life, based upon collective owner ship of the means of material existence m a cooperative commonwealth, cannot af ford to leave Art out of account, as the great source of joy, the harmonizing in fluence of beauty, the spirit of order and Consumers' Cooperation rtion, at once creative and adaptive, of 'lifting men's thoughts on to the j fftièst plane- and yet, withal, a sweet I iliar and domestic spirit, cheering and forting, and gladdening the eyes with (ai and color, as it sheds its refining in-<query> what is the relationship between art and cooperation</query> That made us all mad, so we decided we'd qo in the coal business ourselves in the right waiy and put up our own yard. By that time it was considerably easier to raise moire funds because people had more confidence. In about three weeks time we raised approximately $2,000, which was a long way from 'adequate, but by that time we were used to get ting along on a shoe string. The $2,000 set us up in the coal business and saved our consumer members a considerable amount of money. From Gasoline and Coal to Groceries and Meat Firom this point we developed a coop erative grocery store and meat market. Although the success of it hasn't been as pronounced as we would like to see it, we feel tltoat we are going in the right direction because food is fundamental. Consumers' Cooperation While we haven't made such great sav ings, due to the competition of the chain stores, I'm confident that when more and more cooperatives learn the mer chandising of groceries and federate in to their wholesales and get those big enough to really make large purchasing power possible, that we can do the job better than a private business.<query> how much did the coal company raise</query> In fact, 1 know of no business that cooperatives can not do better than private business. We now have in Racine seven coop erative service stations, a meat market, grocery store and the coal market I've been telling you about. In addition, we have aided other cooperatives in the State to set up our own cooperative au tomobile insurance company, and we also have the agency for cooperative fire insurance from our brotlher cooperatives in Superior. Searching For an Answer on Education We have attempted a considerable program of education and some recrea tion, but we have been working on an uncharted sea, attempting to follow a course wlhich to ourselves was not clear. I'm not sure yet that we have salved, locally or nationally the prob lem of education upon which the whole program hinges. I am not sure we have found the answer.<query> what kind of cooperatives are there in racine</query> Certainly we have learned a great deal more about con sumer cooperation than we knew in the past. Now there are things that we can do right away. We can go out and organ ize urban cooperatives and rural coop eratives, but it seems to me that that isn't all that is necessary. If it's merely a point of making a saving of a few pen nies on a gallon of gasoline and a few nickels on a ton of coal, then it seems to me that our efforts aren't worth while; tihat isn't the job that we're setting out to do. I feel that we've got a much larger job than that on our hands; that the thing we have to strive for is to build a new America founded on an en tirely different conception. Back in 1932 and '33 1 hated Ameri ca's 60 families, the Vanderbilts, the DuPonts, the Morgans, and the rest of them.<query> what is the purpose of cooperatives</query> Perhaps it is because I've grown a few years older, or perhaps it is be- December, 1938 cause we've thought the thing through further. I no longer hate any individual, but I do hate with a deadly hatred a system which has brought about the des titution and the poverty that this depres sion has brought about in this nation. I do hate a system which has sunk so low that it can no longer support the most skilled working class equipped with the finest mechanical equipment in the world, in the richest and most abundant nation on the face of the earth— a sys tem that is no longer capable of pre venting destitution in a nation with the natural resources that We have available. I think that in America we can do a different kind of a job; that we have in America all of the things that we need to bring about an entirely different sys tem of society, a society that is going to enable us to distribute all of the things that we need and provide everybody with plenty.<query> what is the system of destitution</query> I know it can be done, be cause there are no physical barriers and we as cooperatives hold the key to the shackles that bin'd us. Discussion PUBLICITY AND EDUCATION FOLLOWING the trend to discussion ^method, the sectional meeting on Publicity and Education plunged im mediately into a discussion based on the following questions which are of vital concern to both rural and urban groups: 1. Can a strong cooperative movement be built best by expanding into numerous lines, or by concentrating on groceries, gasoline or what ever basic activity has been undertaken? 2. How can democratic participation be re tained in an expanding movement? 3. How can integration of small retail co operatives into large strong units be achieved? The group split into three groups of about 12 each discussing each question. Summary of discussion on question 1: Experience indicates that to start with a central body is not successful.<query> what is the question of public education</query> Unification is best achieved after a foundation of successful small units has been built. A recognition of the need for integration must develop first. The danger of autocratic control can be avoided by autonomy of local units dur ing experimental development of joint activities. 181 Summary df discussion on question 2: Representation by districts is prac ticed by both regional and local cooper atives to increase democratic control. Granting wider powers to committees and establishing committees on a func tional basis was recommended. One suggestion was to encourage active member's who might be prospective board members to attend board meet ings. The use of a mailed ballot, pro portional -representation voting proce dure and development of advisory coun cils such as Ohio's, were suggested. Summary of discussion on question 3: It was felt that local co-ops should follow the lead of parent groups which should lead but not coerce.<query> what is the importance of representation by districts</query> The prob lem of developing leadership indicates the wisdom of entering additional fields slowly. Under-capitalization likewise imboses limitations. There was some difference of o'pinion as to whether separate retail 'cooperatives should foe established for each type of service. Some agreement was reached on the suggestion that rapid and sound prog ress would be made if related services such as groceries and milk were ren dered by a single society, but insurance and health, which are specific services, by separate organizations. Robert L. Smith, Secretary Discussion PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTION ^1 'HE sectional meeting on Purchasing •*- and Distribution was chaired by Homer Young, of Consumers Coopera tive Association, with T. G. Castner, of Eastern Cooperative Wholesale de signated as discussion leader. Because it was desired to get as many points of view as possible on the problems facing retail cooperatives the entire group met as a unit.<query> what is the difference between a retail cooperative and a cooperative</query> Homer Young outlined some of the phases of the problem and threw the meeting open for general discussion which centered about the following questions: How large a percentage of the buying of a local cooperative can and should be done through cooperative wholesales? What is the most effective way to secure compétent personnel? Should all of the cooperative activities in a community be undertaken by a 182 single cooperative, or should separate cooperatives be organized to handle groceries, petroleum products, coal, and other commodities and services? If one cooperative is handling several types of commodities or services should patron age divlidends be paid on a flat rate for all commodities or should separate books be kept on each general classifi cation and different rates of dividends be paid depending on the commodity? Discussion ACCOUNTING AND FINANCING THE sectional meeting on Coopera tive Accounting and Financing was opened by an address by A. J. Smaby of Midland Cooperative Wholesale The discussion which followed was chaired by Werner E. Regli, director of the Cooperative League Accounting Bureau.<query> what is the most effective way to secure compétent personnel</query> In his paper, Mr. Smaby pointed out that lack of control over accounts re ceivable, failure to maintain the proper ratio of inventory to sales, shrinkage in inventory, and similar problems in re tail cooperatives were in a large part due to lack of accounting knowledge on the part of cooperative managers and employees. To correct this deficiency he pointed out that Midland Coopera tive Wholesale and other regional co operatives have set up training courses for cooperative employees and have as sisted groups df cooperatives to estab lish joint bookkeeping services for re tail co-ops which acting alone were un able to maintain trained bookkeeping personnel. The problems whidh, taken together, compose the very large and currently pressing problem of adequately fi nancing retail cooperatives, Mr. Smaby described as follows: Under-capitaliza tion at the time of organization; over investment in fixed assets; extension of credit; over investment in inventory: and the payment of cash patronage divi dends.<query> what is the problem of a retail cooperative</query> Mr. Smaby described steps rec ommended to meet these problems and then the members -of the discussion group tackled jointly the problem of ap plying those principles 'to Specific situa tions in local cooperatives. Because this subject is of such great importance it is planned to publish Mr. Smaby's paper in an early issue of Consumers' Cooper ation.

The other day I bought a suit of clothes. I bought it from a clothier with whom I have dealt for years. The suit needed alterations and he told me he would have to charge me $3.00 for the alterations. I complained that I had never been called on to do that before. But he told me it was necessary; that all the suit merchants had gotten to gether a month before and agreed on a uniform charge for alterations.<query> what is the short cut to fascism</query> jïence everywhere."" CO-OP TOURS New York— The Cooperative League •ill sponsor three cooperative tours dur- * the summer of 1938, arranging for ' jpS to visit cooperatives in Europe, Nova Scotia and the Middlewest. The Trip to Cooperative Europe will be the fifth consecutive tour sponsored by The League and as in previous years will visit the democratic countries of North ern Europe. The Cooperative 'Conference- 1 our ot Nova Scotia in 1937 met with such re sponse that two sections of the tour are being planned for this coming summer. Ninety religious, educational and co-op leaders visited the Maritime provinces on the tour last year. The tour of the Midwestern coopera tive wholesales now being arranged for this -coming summer will be the first com prehensive tour of its kind.

I said to him. ""I suppose you are opposed to Fascism."" This suit vendor happens to belong to a race that is not usually in favor of Fascism. ""Oh. ves,"" he said with great heat. ""Well."" I said, ""You see that little sign. You may not think it very serious. But that is the qerm of Fas cism. Before you and -other men who are doing the same thing get through with the policy which begins with that little sion, von will have Fascism and a dictator in America."" This may seem far-fetched to vou. but that is what I want to talk about ton'qht.<query> who is opposed to fascism</query> Fascism is the most dangerous of all political diseases, preciselv because its workings are inobvious. When Fascism came in certain European countries, the masses were for it without a suspicion that they were marching to the polls to siqn the death warrant of individual liberty and democracy in their coun tries. Two Pied Pipers led their peoole sinqinq and cheering into tyranny. The first, be it remembered, was financed bv the great munition manufacturers of both Germany and France, while the latter was financed by the great bankers df Italy. There are two roads to Fascism in December, 1938 Willis J. Ballinger, Economic Adviser To The Federal Trade Commission America. One is the trail blazed by German and Italian Fascism. The short cut to Fascism is to catch unwary liberals off their guard and sell them a Fascist economic system as the cure for depression.<query> why was fascism financed by the pied pipers</query> No orator will be needed. No campaign expenses will be necessary. Stirring up .hatreds of creed or race can be dispensed with. All that will be necessary is to convince liberals in power that competition as the driving power of our economic system is out moded — that the way to real pros perity lies in scrapping the anti-trust laws and then letting business men get toqether and plan prosperity. The sales talk \vill be impressive. Competition, they will say, is another name for chaos. Price cutters will be called destroyers of business, bacilli of unemployment and vanished dividends. The anti-trust laws prevent business men from getting to gether and planning- production. En- durinq prosperity, it will be said, is af ter all a problem for business men. Get the amateur regulators of business out of the way and let business men confer and put our economic system in order.<query> why do liberals want competition</query> For the last fifteen vears there has been some very short-sighted thinkinq about competition. Indeed, for a brief period not. so long ago, we were on the verge of sanctioning by law the perma nent elimination of competition from our economic order. When business men are permitted to get together to restrict trade, to restrain trade, to cut down production, to pro duce scarcity, to get prices up, to fix prices, they are doing precisely what was done under the old guild svstem. They want to turn the clock back five hundred years. Up to the thirteenth or fourteenth century there was a theory in existence called the theorv of the Just Price. That was a very noble name for a very de leterious thing. The just price was a price which gave every man his cost of doing business and a modest profit.<query> what is the theory of the just price</query> To fix that just price and maintain it, the guilds and the State little by little, had 183 , ,i i, James P. \Afarbasse Président ' i ij 1 he Cooperative League i, | Murray D.

Evah Lave, Acting Secretary. SCHOOLS AND COOPERATIVES sectional meeting on Schools and Cooperatives was opened by Dr. H. G. Lull, head of the department of Education, Kansas State Teachers College, and member of the Cooperative Committee of the National Education Association, who sketched briefly the educational background for the discus sion. Dr. Lull pointed out that there are three general areas of the curriculum. The first, dealing with social problems, should be required of all students be cause it is a study of problems faced by all. The second, or vocational section, should be comprised entirely of elective subjects so that students may develop their particular interests and abilities. The third area deals with the play life or recreation and should also be op tional. In the social studies, Dr. Lull de clared, we must talke the initiative in training for democracy.<query> what is the purpose of the cooperative sectional meeting</query> Acquisitive ness must be balanced with sharing. Freedom must be balanced with social responsibility. Patriotism must be bal anced with the international view. Supporting the academic work of the social studies a program of creative .rec reation is education functioning in a free, voluntary way. The student is en riching his experience, discovering him self, 'and learning to cooperate with others. Recreation, properly conducted, makes socially conditioned persons. With this general introduction Dr. Lull placed these questions for group discussion: To what extent and how should a high school student body be organized on a co operative basis? In introducing cooperative material, should it be integrated with other subjects or presented in separate courses? What forms of recreation .would .contribute to cooperative education? What qualities of leadership are required? The group discussion brought out a great deal of valuable material on each of these questions.<query> what is recreation in education</query> December, 1938 Using the example of the junior high school at Winnetka, Illinois, a well rounded program of student cooperation in all phases of school life was illus trated. All student organizations are chartered by the democratically elected Student Council and operated as nearly as possible on a completely democratic basis. The student store is a consumers cooperative. The students operate their own credit union, and run their news paper as an example of public owner ship. The discussion on integrated vs spe cialized courses on cooperatives pointed out that the schools today have fol lowed the trend of the industrial revolu tion to such a degree that we now have over-specialization.

The group expressed the belief th'at recreation should follow the cooperative rather than competitive pattern wher ever possible. Effective recreation will tend to bring forward the type of leadership desired. Merlin G. Miller, Secretary CAMPUS COOPERATIVES THE Chairman of the National Com mittee on Student Cooperatives be gan this session by presenting the ac- companyling report on the progress of the student cooperative movement dur ing the last two years. The meeting then turned to the discussion of the problem of the development of a Na tional Student Cooperative League. The group felt that a series of regional con ferences .should be arranged before any further efforts were made to build a national league. The difficulty of ar ranging a suitable time for a national meeting, together with the great dis tances involved, makes it seem much more practicable to hold regional con- 195 ferences covering perhaps two or three states.<query> what is the purpose of student cooperatives</query> The experience of the Pacific Coast cooperatives indicates that such a regional meeting -can be very reward ing. Accordingly, it was decided im mediately to attempt to set up several regional conferences throughout the United States. The question of additional literature was taken up. The delegates decided that the most useful publication under present circumstances would consist of a -group of case histories arranged to show the various possibilities and forms of student cooperatives. That type of material, it was felt, could be prepared in such a way as to show specific pro cedures used by various organizations; thus the reader could gain practical sug gestions as well as general information. National Committee On Student Cooperatives In December, 1935, when the Federal Council of Churches held its Seminar on Cooperatives in Indianapolis, a de mand arose for information about stud ent cooperative associations.<query> what was the purpose of the pacific coast cooperatives</query> Because practically nothing w'as known as to the nature or extent of this movement, re presentatives from student cooperatives in eleven states met to plan a clearing house to gather information from exist ing groups and to make it available to projected ones. This group took the name above to permit the formation later of a National .Student Coopera tive League. Since its formation the National Committee on Student Cooperatives has made four surveys of existing groups, prepared mimeographed suggestions for new groups, published ten articles and inspired several others, corresponded widely, furnished speakers for eight na tional conventions, broadcast once over a national hook-up, and assembled in formation on all types of student coop eratives. ""Campus Cooperatives"" is a five-cent handbook prepared especially to help in starting new organizations. In two years, one hundred fifty new groups have been formed, at least part ly as a result of the N. C. S. C. The Committee feels that it has helped to make a college education possible for many hundreds of students who other wise could never have attended college.<query> what is the purpose of the national committee on student cooperatives</query> The following figures show the ex tent of cooperatives on college camp uses: Members Volume Savings 51 Dormitories 5364 $ 652,758 $474,048 (183 units) 34 Dining Clubs 2059 228,388 58,402 65 Book Stores 93518 2,464,100 94,300 10 General 826 23,144 300 29 Miscellaneous 2850 385,500 31,000 189 Total 104,627 $3,753,710 $658,050 (321 units) Although the National Committee on Student Cooperatives is not a part of The Cooperative League of the U.S.A., it is recognized by that body and works closely with it. Now a National Stud ent Cooperative League is being 'con sidered. Such an organization on a self- supporting basis will do much more ef fective work than can the present Com mittee, handicapped as it is in both finances and personnel. Anyone inter ested in any phase of student coopera tives is invited to correspond with the committee, 5757 University Avenue, Chicago.<query> what is the total cost of a college cooperative</query> William Moore, Chairman, National Committee on Student Cooperatives REPORTS OF DEPARTMENTS AND COMMITTEES COMMITTEE ON PUBLICITY AND EDUCATION THE 1937 'conference on Cooperative Publicity and Education was held June 18, 19 and 20, immediately after the conclusion of the National Cooper ative Recreation School iat 'Grand View College, Des Moines, and preceding the American Institute of Cooperation which was held at Ames, Iowa. A report of this Conference was made by the 196 Secretary of the Committee on Publicity and Education to t'he constituent mem bers of The League through the media of the August, 1937, issue o'f Consumers' Cooperation. The Committee critically analyzed 'the success or failure of the traditional con ference method in its meeting following the Publicity and Education Conference on June 20, 1937. The procedure and technique of the following conference * Consumers' Cooperation program was made at that time.<query> when was the conference on cooperative publicity and education held</query> Since the discussion group technique was found to be productive of democratic processes in adult educational work by cooper'a- tors in Ohio and elsewhere, this method w'as recommended to and adopted by the Committee. A suggested list of topics to be used in a poll of the 'Committee members in determining the program, for 1938 was also adopted. The second Conference Program of this present Committee was conducted at Bowe'n Country Club, Waukegan, Illinois, on June 23, 24 and ,25 of this year. A gener'al discussion of the topic presented by one 'more experienced in that form of Educational and Publicity activity was followed by gr'oup discus sions with each group bringing in its reports on the following topics: ""Education of Cooperative Employees"" ""Education of Cooperative Members"" ""Education of the General Public"" ""Cooperative Journalism and Publicity"" ""Cooperative Recreation and its relation to the Cooperative Movement"" ""Cooperative Youth Education"" ""Cooperative Literature"" This form of cooperative experience was shared together by sixty-six coop- era tors representing fourteen affiliated regional cooperatives and district leagues, constituent groups of the Na tional League, ten retail societies, two Canadian (cooperatives, one state farm organization, two Federal agencies, and one state government agency.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative education committee</query> The efforts of the Committee have been directed toward providing an op portunity for the cross-fertilization of cooperative educational ideas. Bu't sug gestions of the Comlmittee members for an organized national program of action have been thwarted by the lack of a sufficient budget to carry the personnel of the national staff to make such a pro gram possible. In conclusion the following sugges tions are offered not in criticism of the present personnel nor of its policies but rather1 as an expression of opinion from the present Committee directed to this Congress and to the Board which it will elect: December, 1938 1. Provide an income that will adequately fi nance a national office and a staff to meet present day needs. 2. Correlate the present educational activities of the several regional cooperatives and dis trict leagues. 3. Popularize the present national organ for general consumption and or produce a pub lication of a more technical nature for Ad ministrators and Directors.<query> what was the purpose of the committee</query> 4. Standardize the production of general pam phlet material to lessen the tendency for too frequent duplication. 5. Publish a pictorial presentation of coopera tives in America: Co-op U.S.A. 6. Produce a national film for use among our 800,000 members and millions of non-mem bers. 7. Establish a legislative representative at our national capital. 8. Contact and arrange with producers for the production and publication of needed litera ture for the public, for our schools and our organized members' educational groups, that more adequately meet our present needs. Glenn Thompson, Secretary, Publicity and Education Committee COOPERATIVE DESIGN SERVICE TO keep an idea alive! This is the function of Cooperative Design Service. This is the essential purpose for which it was established four years ago and under which it has been operating since. When visiting Cooperative Europe in 1934 I received an impression which grew into a conviction.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative design service</query> That is, that on ly in Cooperative Scandinavia had the consumer cooperative movement reached a position of real significance in the cul ture of its people. Knowing, of course, of the imjpressively large volumes and exceedingly large memberships, in many of the other countries, there remained that lack of a place of distinctive signifi cance -which was so apparent, for in stance in Sweden. Why should tlhis be true? Where does this vital difference lie? It lies, I believe, in the fact that the leadership of Co operative Scandinavia, in line with their admittedly aggressively commercial poli cies, does not overlook a single oppor tunity to achieve significance. In the Jast fifteen years the idea of the representation of cooperation by the best in design and architecture has been seized upon and exploited to the full. Because of tihïs aggressive, pioneering spirit Scandinavian Cooperative Archi- 197 itecture is known the world over; and has brought distinction to the entire Scandinavian people as well as to the Coopérative (movement itself.<query> what is the difference between cooperative scandinavia and cooperative sweden</query> It was with this understanding of the •European situation that the plans for •Cooperative Design Service were for- • mulated. Even though it has carried throug'h projects of Various kinds the •fundamental object has been, and is now, the preservation and the stimula tion of the idea of a great art, design and architecture for the cooperatives in the United States. And without a distinctive architecture and design the Coopera tives cannot attain a place of maximum significance in American life. Should I be permitted a jbrophecy I would say that I see soon in America, the selection by the united cooperative wholesales of the outstanding architect of the country, through whose skill and experience a great work will be ini tiated. Through him and his aids an American Cooperative Architecture, sane and modern, practical and beauti- iful, will evolve which will be the visual (interpretation of Cooperation to the •world.<query> what is cooperative architecture</query> Jam , 1938 New Co-op.

Esther Greenleaf, Director COOPERATIVE LEAGUE ACCOUNTING BUREAU WHEN The Cooperative League Accounting Bureau was organ ized in 1925 with the help of the Amer ican Fund for Public Service it faced several serious difficulties. Because there were relatively few co operatives in the East, it was obvious that an accounting bureau could not be developed if it had to depend on coop erative work; alone. Therefore, its ac counting services were offered to liberal non-profit organizations as well. The question of employing account ing assistance was made difficult be cause of the seasonable nature of ac counting worlk; because the bureau had no available fund's to finance payrolls, and because during the rush seasons 198 when assistance was necessary, time was not available for the proper train ing and supervision of juniors.<query> when was the cooperative league accounting bureau established</query> In addi tion, the performance of auditing work by juniors was not acceptable to many organizations. Furthermore, we had to compete with high professional stand ards and had to furnish certified audits. Creating An Efficient Auditing Service To solve one problem, an arrange ment with 'the Labor Bureau, Inc., was attempted during 1926, 1927 and part of 1928. Accounting work for labor unions was undertaken, but this proved unsat isfactory. Work was then undertaken for the member organizations of the Central States Cooperative League, but this too, had to be abandoned. The dis tance was too great and the traveling cost too heavy. In the meanwhile, work was developing in the East and fur nished a satisfactory answer to this problem. The problem, of securing adequate assistance, was solved when Jules Eng lander, Howard J. Apfel, Louis Eng lander and Edwin R. Apifel became staff accountants of the Bureau.<query> why was the labor bureau created</query> They were paid the fee for engagements handled by them and in turn defrayed all the expenses pertaining thereto, and as sumed the responsibility for collections, This arrangement put at the disposal of The League well qualified accountants with wide and varied experience, work ing at League rates and an accounting organization capable of taking on any engagements that came along. Recent Progress During the year ending December 31, 1938, the income of the Accounting Bu reau increased some $3,500.00. Most of this increase was due to cooperative au dits. Up to 1937, the income of the Bu reau was roughly 50% from cooperative work and 50% from non-profit work. This year, the relationship was roughly 60% and 40% respectively. We esti mate that the average fees collected are around $18.00 per day for senior time. Much time for which no charge can be made must be devoted to meet ings and special conferences, as well las to the study of new tax laws and legis lation.<query> average salary of an accounting league</query> In addition to the regular auditing Consumers' Cooperation work, the Accounting Bureau furnished bookkeeping courses at the Eastern Co operative Institute, Rochdale Institute and an evening course to cooperative clubs in this district. We also prepared and published ""A Primer of Bookkeep ing for Cooperatives."" Future Plans for the Bureau The prospects for further expansion are .good. Cooperative clubs in our dis trict are developing into store organiza tions. More and more, the liberal non profit organizations are coming to us with their accounting problems. How ever, this is only one of the many pos sibilities for growth. Cooperative whole sale organizations, in many places, are operating accounting departments. The audits for these wholesales are often performed by their own accounting de partments or, in some cases, by local private firms. It is obvious that the af fairs of an organization should not be audited by its own employees and it wpuld seem that the logical agency to perform these audits would be the Co- operative League Accounting Bureau.<query> what is cooperative accounting</query> We believe that the department is equipped and ready to undertake this job.

CLUSA SERVICE SERVICE, Inc. was organ- ized iby The Cooperative League in 1930 to serve as an insurance depart ment, and particularly to purchase on 1 behalf of cooperative organizations suich insurance as they might need. While it was organized under The Cooperative League and originally planned as a na tional service, the nature of the insur ance business is such that most of its development has been in t!he immediate vicinity of its office in New York, the ; only exception of importance being the handling of fidelity bonds for societies farther afield. Most of the insurance which Clusa placed for cooperative societies or for their individual members and friends had to be put in ordinary commercial companies because there were no coop erative companies available.<query> what was the purpose of the cooperative league</query> This situa tion has been changed within the past December, 1938 few months. In Marclh, 1938, the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, a member of The Cooperative League, began to write business in New York State. The importance of getting this cooperative company off to a good start in New York overshadows the im portance of strictly brokerage business sufficiently so that the Board of Direc tors of Clusa Service at a meeting on July 14 authorized the signer of this re port, who has been manager of Clusa from its organization, to go on a part time basis and devote most of his atten tion to cooperative automobile insur ance. In order to facilitate this Mr. S. E. Mattson, an experienced insurance man, has been made assistant manager and is taking over most of the office operations of Clusa. The added time that this gives the writer for establishing per sonal contacts should be of advantage to both the Farm Bureau Mutual and to Clusa.<query> who is manager of clusa</query> William A.-Hyde. Manager, COOPERATIVE SOCIETY FOR RECREATIONAL EDUCATION r Iy HE Cooperative Society for Recrea- -*- tional Education was organized about two years ago last June, by an informal group (which came together from 13 .different stetes to study the problems of recreation in our modern society and how we 'Could make our recreation in our society more truly educational, particularly in the coopér ative way. I^ast year we held our an nual session at JDes Moines, Iowa, in conjunction with the committee on edu cation and publicity. At that time we had 13 or 14 states represented, about 45 full time students. The committee voted to mee't again the next June at Waukegan. ,At Waukegan we had representatives not only from 15 states in this country, but from 2 provinces in Canada. The Cooperative Society has been isponsored Iby The Cooperative League in somewhat the same fashion as the League has isponsored other groups, such as the Rochdale Institute, an,d I ,think this is a pret'ty ,good experi mental method to find out wh'at groups are wor'thy of support and to explore 199 educationally the various means of building cooperative understanding and cooperative structure.<query> what is cooperative society</query> The Institute next year will be held somewhere in Minnesota .and the vari ous ccoperative wholesales are invited to give it their 'attention and to support it by at least one delegate ,from each w'holesale. This organization so far has been operated thoroughly democratical ly by the jstudents -who attend. Already in two states the students have gone back to form local chapters, or socie ties, in order to .foster the objects of the organization. Carl R. Hutchinson, President, Cooperative Society for .Recreational Education ROCHDALE INSTITUTE A full time training school in Con sumers Cooperation has been dis cussed in these Congresses since 1932, and in 1936 tike Beard of Directors of The Cooperative League formally ap proved the opening of such an institute in New Yoric as a department of The League. That action brought our League in dine with England and Sweden where coqperative colleges have 1'ong since been established to ensure adequate facilities for the advanced study of Co operation.<query> where is the rochdale institute</query> Franlkly, it was an experimental step. The assistance and experience of the district leagues, wholesales and indi vidual societies were solicited and counted upon in order that the best possible theory and practical training might be offered to acceptable students. The League House in New York was chosen as headquarters for Rochdale Institute, and Dr. Warbasse who de- velcped the plan into definite form, be came director. A Board of Trustees and a faculty of cooperative leaders and uriiversity teachers were selected. Sev eral people expressed their interest in Rochdale Institute with financial sup port w;hich, added to the tuition fees of the first class, enabled the scnool to •open it's first session in the Fall of 1937. The curriculum of Rochdale Institute provides for academic training which is followed by actual practical work in co operative societies. Discussion methods 200 of study and actual work in coopera tives during students' residence at the school, bring about an understanding of cocperative business and problems.<query> what was the purpose of rochdale institute</query> A student buying club, cooperative rent ing of living quarters, and the natural interchange of ideas among students of Rochdale Institute who have come to New York from 25 of the United States, Canada, and Germany, have well supplemented much cf the theory presented at the School. A Practical School Rochdale Institute is a practical school with a practical purpose. Its stu dent body has been restricted for each cf the first three terms to about 20 stu dents because of limited facilities. Over two-thirds of them are actively engaged in cooperative service at this time from Maine to the western states and Cana da. Many expressions of satisfaction have been received from the societies in which they are employed. It is planned to develop the Institute into a genuine notional training school that will be a practical 'aid to all the constituent members of The Coopera tive League.<query> what is rochdale institute</query> These three major fields of eco nomic activities are discussed in the first three chapters of the book. The fourth chapter dis cusses race relationships; then follows a chapter on choosing a vocation or avocation, with the concluding chapter discussing social religion. This is a practical book. It is not up in the clouds discussing a ""Heaven on Earth"" or a ""Co operative Commonwealth."" While there will probably be some disagreement with the authors as to the classification of the fields of cooperative and public economic activities, these différences of. opinion can readily be eliminated by the pro cess of democratic discussion and practical or ganization. There are pages in the book suggesting definitely the possible vocations in cooperative, labor and public utility fields which should be of great help to the youth of America. This book might be termed the barrage of ""A Crusade for Cooperation"" which may be similar to the Student Volunteer Movement.<query> what is the purpose of the book a crusade for cooperation</query> Recognition of the purpose and administration of Rochdale Institute is already evidenced by the fact that it has been chartered by the Board of Re gents of the University of New York. When proposals for Rochdale Insti tute were first launched in 1931 by George Halonen, Henry Negley, Dr. William Zeuch, Colston Warne, J. W. Baker, George W. Jacobson and others, it was claimed that a special full-time cooperative institute was necessary be cause no other college gave that atten tion to cooperative subject's which the needs of the movement demanded. Rochdale Institute, since its establish ment, has resulted in better direction of cooperative instruction by providing more advanced courses; it has provided the movement with well-trained em ployees; its students have produced many valuable research reports; its es tablishment has been followed by an ex tension of correspondence tuition; and it has strengthened the bonds of Inter national Cooperation.<query> who founded rochdale institute</query> But Rochdale Institute as yet is only in its infancy; what it has done in the Consumers' Cooperation directions indicated is as nothing com pared with the service it can render when adequately supported. Our mem bership is increasing and our trade im proving. The time is ripe for the further development of Rochdale Institute which requires for this purpose more students and more money. Societies can provide Institute scholarships for their employees and aid the voluntary field work program at the end of the academ ic sessions by agreeing to permit cer tain selected students to gain actual practical experience for a two month period in the type of cooperative enter prise in which these students plan to make their life work. Rochdale Institute stands on its rec ord and earnestly asks on ithis, its first birthday, your good wishes and sup port. Lionel Perkins, Registrar BUREAU OF COOPERATIVE MEDICINE UPON the approval of the Board of Directors of The Cooperative League, the Bureau of Cooperative Medicine received its papers for sepa rate incorporation under the Non-Pecu niary laws of the State of New Jersey.<query> what is rochdale institute</query> This action was taken to protect the sources of funds upon which the Bureau •relies for support. Because of the limitations placed on the Bureau by the Treasury Depart ment, which was asked for a ruling on tax exemption, it was decided to set up a complementary organization to engage in activities denied to ' the Bureau. In consequence the Association of Medical Cooperatives, a federation of existing 'cooperative health associations, was or ganized in June, 1938. To complete the legal structure the Bureau Publishing Company Was incor porated under the non-profit corpora tion law of the State of New York to take care of all (publishing activities. During the year Miss Dora Maxwell, Northeastern representative of the Credit Union National Association; Bernard Reis, a director of Consumers Union; and N. I. Stone, director, Na tional Bureau of Economic Research, ""were added to the Board of Directors.<query> when was the bureau publishing company established</query> December, 1938 Educational Work Extensive educational work has been carried on during the past year. This 'has been developed under a five point program': First, through weekly news bulletins; second, through the m'aga- 'zines; third, through the utilization of the radio, magazines, lecture halls and •newspapers as media which permit of the broadest dissemination of informa tion; fourth, through pamphlets and books; and fifth, through the use of the Bureau's library which is now recog nized as one of the country's most com plete collections of data on the subject of Cooperative Medicine. The magazine Cooperative Health is still too young to judge its effectiveness but there is every indication that it will, in the coming year, develop into a worthy organ of the movement. As to the use of such publicity media as radio, magazines, etc., the past year has seen the subject discussed in our leading magazines 'until at the present time nearly all the important magazines have carried or contracted for articles on cooperative health associations.<query> what is cooperative health</query> The jsubjject has likewise been dis cussed on the leading radio progr'ams and by most of the commentators. Research Work Of the research projects completed during the year one has been on how to organize a cooperative health associa tion. The results will be published in a pamphlet under that name. The second project has been a study of the teaching of medical economics in the country's medical schools and will appear shortly in the Journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges under the authorship of Dr. Kingsley Roberts and •Dr. M. M. Davis. The third is a study of the operation of a Cooperative Health Association serving a population of 20,000. Two projects nearing completion are a study of Group Medical practice and a study of the medical administration of .Group Hospital Plans. Two projected projects are, first, a manual of forms and procedures to be used in the opera- titan of cooperative health associations and second, a study of .medical service in the mining areas of Southern West 201 Virginia.<query> what is the research project of cooperative health association</query> This would be undertaken in cooperation with the United Mine Workers of America and the Good Will Fund should plans materialize. Organization Assistance , Nine instances of such work might be mentioned. In Greenbelt, Maryland, initial detail plans were drawn up by the Bureau's staff. Plans for a coopera tive ' health association in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were checked and recom mendations were made. The by-laws of Group Health Association in Washing ton, D. C. were amended following spe cific recommendations. As a result of recommendations by the Bureau, the American Provident Association of Los Angeles, California, amended its by- 1'aws so as to more closely conforta to cooperative principles. The development of the Cooperative Health Association of New York has been closely watched by the Bureau and practically all steps taken are with the advice of the Bureau.<query> what was the purpose of the bureau of health care</query> The Bureau has been advising on the development of a Cooperative Health Association in Boston, Mass. The United Mine Workers of America have been mentioned above in connection with the research work of the Bureau. Should the work: be undertaken, plans for the establishment of cooperative health associations in mining towns would be checked. The same technique would then be used on behalf of other unions. In addition to these plans specifically mentioned, the facilities of the Bureau have been used by most of the associa tions already in operation, such as Group Health Association and Wage Earners Health Association of St. Louis. Medical Society Opposition The most significant and far reaching activity of the Bureau ,in this regard has bçen îts cooperation with the Depart ment of Justice of tlhe U. S. Government in its Grand Jury Investigation of the American Medical Association and its District o'f Columbia branch, which be gan Octdber 17th.<query> what is the purpose of the bureau of health care</query> In Superior, Wisconsin, the Medical 'Society is now to cooperate in the •development of an experiment in Coop erative Medicine. This suggestion was 202 made to tihe Wisconsin Medical Society 'early in 1938. The experiment will not be limited to the Superior area. Progress has been retarded in several c'ases, and organization prevented in several instances, by the opposition of Medical Societies. This has been the 'case in Akron, Ohio, and has delayed the beginning of operations. Legal Aid The staff and counsel of the Bureau have advised numerous groups on legal problems. The Association of Medic'al Cooperatives filed a brief, as a friend of the court, in the litigation involving Group Health in Washington. The Bu reau has also advised the Cooperative Health Association of New York and the Cooperative Health Association of San Francisco on legal matters.<query> what is the medical society of superior wi</query> It has cooperated with numerous organizations on the drafting of by-laws. Dr. Kingsley Roberts, Director COMMITTEE ON RELATIONS OF ORGANIZED LABOR AND COOPERATIVES IT is not necessary to emphasize the importance o'f this subject since it is clear that in countties like Great Britain •and in Scandinavia where the coopera tive movement has grown strong, it has done so with the active support of or ganized labor as well as of organized 'farmers. There are many issues involved and •conditions to be met as well as educa tional worik to be done in order t'o se cure the hearty .support of organized la bor. Such issues include "" wages and hours for employees of cooperatives and •recognition of labor unions, and on the other hand a constructive policy on the part of unions toward cooperatives. 1. Speaking and Literature The Chairman and the other mem bers of the Committee, Miss Dorothy Kenyon and Prof. Horace M. Kallen, have spoken on Cooperation in labor union meetings in many parts of the country, eliciting from the rank and file very keen interest in Consumers Co- •operation as a method of control of prices and a step toward economic de- Consumers' Cooperation mocracy.<query> what is the importance of cooperative labor</query> Rele'ases of these addresses 'have been sent out by the Cooperative League News Service and carried in 'many newspapers—cooperative and la bor papers and the religious press; the 'League has also .made available reprints of special case studies such as that of the Racine Cooperative, 85% of the 'membership of which are tr'ade union- 'ists. Reprints of the Chairman's article on Organized Labor and Consumers Cooperation (from the Annals of the Amidricao. Academy of Political arid So cial Science) are also available. 2. Exchange of Speakers Secondly the Committee has arranged for organized labor speakers at cooper ative conferences and for farmer-coop- erator speakers at labor union meetings and for representatives of both on gen eral conferences on Cooperatives such as those conducted jointly last winter by national church groups, Protestant, •Catholic and Jewish. 3.<query> what is the cooperative league</query> The sugges tion is made of a possible ""Student Social Action Movement."" Such a movement might well adopt a slogan ""A Cooperative World in This Genera tion,"" similar to the slogan adopted by the Student Volunteer Movement ""The Evangelizing of the World in This Generation."" The authors state that they are not attempting to form a new or ganization and rightfully conclude, ""If there is to be a student movement for social action, the stu dents themselves will have to go forward in this day, as those of the former generation did in their day. Each generation has to build their new order within the framework of the old; and they have to do it themselves."" It is to be regretted that in the cooperative chapter the authors failed to tell the life stories of a few outstanding cooperative leaders, after whom students might well pattern, as the chapters on labor and politics cited illustrations of such leaders.<query> what is the slogan of the student social action movement</query> Resolutions An increasing number of resolutions endorsing consumers cooperation are to be noted by the A. F. of L. and by unions affiliated with the CIO. An in creasing number of friendly resolutions by cooperatives toward organized labor are also in evidence. 4. Informal Conferences The Committee suggested and some of its members participated in informal acquaintanceship conferences be'tween various regional cooperative associa tions (especially those composed chief ly of farmers) and leaders of organized labor in their areas. Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Benjamin have both referred to these get-togethers which have been productive of imueh clearer understand ing and closer cooperation of the two groups. 5. Institute on Organized Labor and Coopertitives The major project of the Committee was the three-day Institute on Organ ized Labor and Cooperatives held at Dillonrvale, Ohio, September 16-18, 1938, and attended by 160 delegates from both A. F. of L. and CIO unions December, 1938 from Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states, and a number of representatives of farm and cooperative organizations from those states.<query> what was the purpose of the afl committee</query> The October issue of Consumers' Cooperationi carries an ac count of the Institute at which one sensed in a thrilling way the keen in terest and present readiness f.t trade union members to organize also as con sumers in cooperatives. Many union delegates were already members of co operatives and others went away in spired to start study groups and become active in the movement. The Committee plans a second Institute at Racine, Wis consin, in February, 1939. The Committee has operated w'ithout any funds, speakers volunteering their services and covering their own ex penses. The Dillonvale Institute took up a collection of $52 to help promote our next Institute. 6. Full Time Workers Needed Informal effort's have been made by the Chairman and Mr. Bowen to per suade both the A. F. of L. and CIO to set aside full-time organizers to promote 'education among trade unions on Con sumers Cooperation, bu't so far without success.<query> when was the dillonvale institute established</query> It m'ig'ht, however, be a good example if The Cooperative League were itself to engage a full-time worker •in this very important field. 7. Congress Labor Session About thirty delegates and guests participated in the group conference on Organized Labor and Coopera tives under the leadership of James Myers, chairman of the League's Com mittee on that subject. The attendance was widely representative including the official fraternal delegates from the AFL and the CIO, representatives of a num ber o!f -local unions, representatives of a number of the largest cooperative wholesales and retail societies, and gov ernment officials. Three questions were proposed for discussion and brought out a flood of information and constructive sugges tions from the group. They were ( 1 ) What are the barriers to understanding between farmers and organized labor. (2) What can be done to draw these groups closer together.<query> what was the purpose of the labor conference</query> (3) How can consumers cooperation be made their common meeting ground? 203 Under the first question a number of reasons for prejudice between farmers and organized labor were mentioned, in cluding the wide spread belief among farmers tlha't high union wages are chief ly responsible for the exorbitant prices farmers have to pay for manufactured products. It was pointed out, however, •that the recent survey by the National Resources Committee shows incomes of farlmers and wage-earners very similar and both lower than other population groups. Attention was drawn to the October issue of Consumers Guide, pub lished by the Dept. of Agriculture, which has a comprehensive digest of this important Report of the National Resources Committee. It was agreed that propaganda from sources wishing to keep farmers prejudiced against labor is responsible for much misunderstand ing. Other issues discussed were wages and hours of employees of cooperatives, use o'f union label on co-op printing, use of union made products where possible, recognition of unions by cooperatives, and the parallel obligation of labor unions to recognize in cooperatives an ally in the general labor movement wh'ich should be assisted and not penal ized by premature demands for higher wages than the unions themselves de mand from private competitors.<query> why are farmers prejudiced against labor</query> It was brought out that as fast as economically possible, however, cooperatives should set the pace for higher wages and better working conditions. The group experienced a vital sense of the meetings of minds, removed of prejudice, and frank facing of the real problems involved. There was discus sion as to how such get-togethers of farmers, cooperators and representatives of organized labor can meet frequently for such rewarding s'tudy. Key to City Organization In conclusion I would say that large ly because of the broad vision and ef fective approach of the general secre tary of The League to larger groups pre viously not actively interested in con sumers cooperation, there appears to me to be new promise of the cooperative Movement in America becoming strong in cities as well as rural areas, among organized labor as well as with organ ized farmers, and among professional 204 and church people; developments which have imade highly significant advances in the past three years.<query> why was the cooperative movement important</query> It augurs well for an American cooperative movement as •strong, effective and comprehensive as those in Groat Britain and Scandinavia 'to which we look for so mulch inspira- Ition. James Myers, Chairman NOVA SCOTIA TOUR MR. CHAIRMAN and fellow coop- era'tors: I'm jsure it's a great privi lege for me to be able Ito report briefly on Oie question of the Nova Scotia tours. I hold lin my h'a^d a financial re port covering the two years that these tours hav'e been -going on and I'm very happy to see that it shows a balance of $1.30. I also hold in my hand a .list of the people who took part in our tours of Nova Scotia during 'these two years. I'tai very igl'ad t'o report that ,299 people went from America to Nbva Scotia to s'tudy the Nova (Scotia movement.<query> who is the chairman of the nova scotia tour</query> These people (came from 32 different states in the union, from Alaska, from the West Indies—one came up there this year from South Africa—all the way up to Nova Scotia to study the cooperative movement and become >a part of the tour. This .group was mlade up of Pro testants, Catholics, Jews, and Negroes, and we had some great opportunities to cooperate 'together. I have a letter here fromi the Exten sion Department of St. Fra,ncis Xavier University rwhic'h shows -something of the significance of wha't's happening up there .and how the people in America feel about it. This letter says that there were about 300 Americans in attend ance at the Rural and Industrial Con ference this year besides the 208 who were registered in the 'tour. Besides 'that an average of 10 Americans every day from t'he first of March until 'the last of September 'stopped in their office to in quire about .the Nova Scotia movement, to iget literature and statistics.<query> how many americans attended the nova scotia cooperative movement</query> That means over 1,000 people besides the tour groups cteime up (from America ,to study this movement. They are going1 up there because of 'the reality of what's happening in Nova Scotia. J.« Henry Carpenter, Director Cooperative League Tours TREASURER'S REPORT I want to call your attention to what we as a League include. According to the statement made by our President on Wednesday morning, we have about 965,000 members. We have about 1700 constituent so cieties and these societies are doing a business of over $50,000,000 a year. Of those constituent societies some are regionals—that is, groups which in clude a large number of other societies. We have 16 such regionals. One of them, our host, the Consumers Coopera tive Association. I understand has a membership of over 125,000. Now what is our job gathered here as .members of The League?<query> how many members does cooperative league tour have</query> It is not for me to tell you what that job is. I think you know its size and importance better than I do, but it is my job in the face of the past few months of a threatened war with Fascism at our very doors, believing as we do that we are one of the few bulwarks against war and Fas cism, to tell you something of the sup port which you are giving The Cooper ative League. In budgeting the year 1937, the best we could hope for in dues and contribu tions from the constituent societies was $17,280. Stop a minute and think of the job which we were attacking and the support which is being given it to tackle this problem. Our actual expenditure was $17,375—that is, we exceeded our budget by a little less than $100, but the support which was promised was not entirely given and our actual income, therefore, was $16,587, with a net loss of $787.<query> what was the best we could hope for in dues and contributions from the constituent societies? This excess of expenditure over income has continued through the pres ent calendar year. Up to the present time when the report was rendered the income was $12,135; the expenditures Consumers' Cooperation December, 1938 were $13,386—a net loss of $1251. We spent for salaries for the League $11,236. I may say in the society. Con sumers Cooperative Services, of which I was general (manager for a certain number of years, our salary budget for educational purposes was between $11,- 000 and $12,000 a year, and we cover only a small section of New York City. The salary budget of The League is $11,236. Our other expenses, including rent, telephone, postage, traveling, dues —I could go on indefinitely—was $6,139. It doesn't seem as though that were an undue expenditure, in view of the job.<query> what is the salary of the league</query> This book doubtless will be widely used in dis cussion groups on college campuses as well as by other study groups. It fills a long felt need. 15 THE PRESS BOOSTS CONSUMERS' COOPERATION Boilermakers Journal, November, ""Organization Answer to H. C. L."", Albert H. Jenkins.

If these books had been sold at the ordinary book stores they would have brought in $20,437; actually the public paid for them $11,113, a saving of over $9,000. Of this $11,113, $4,334 went in discount to The Cooperative League and to the regional organizations. Now what is the reason for our present situation? As you know, in the past ten years The Cooperative League has grown from a small organization into a large organization, and no ade quate basis for dues payment has been found. We have regionals, like our host, with a membership of over 125,- 000.<query> how many books have the cooperative league sold</query> We have small retails whose mem bership is anywhere from 50 to 5,000. We have credit unions, insurance com panies, and mail order houses. On what basis shall these different constituent so cieties pay dues? The result of no ade quate basis for dues payment, you see in this report. If as constituent so cieties we who care for this League wish it to continue, some adequate basis of dues payment must be found so that this League in the coming years may have adequate support. Mary E. Arnold, Treasurer 205 REPORT OF RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE MR. CHAIRMAN and delegates to the llth Biennial Congress of The Cooperative League of the U.S.A. The Resolutions Committee in under taking its duties, and in offering these resolutions expresses to all of you its appreciation of this opportunity to thus serve you in the great movement of which we are all a part.<query> what is the basis for dues payment</query> The committee presents to you, not with a resolution, but in recognition of its worth, a communication from Mr. C. A. Olson, Chairman of the Discussion Group on Church and Cooperatives, and from Dr. J. Henry Carpenter, its co-chairman, who is also chairman of the committee on the Church and Co operatives of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. The communication is signed also by the Rev. G. A. McDonald, S. J., who is chairman of the Committee on Cooper atives of the National Catholic Rural Life Conference. ""The section on the Church and Coopera tives wishes to express its gratitude to The Cooperative League for providing an op portunity for discussion of the rela-tion of the church to the cooperative movement as a part of the fornral program of the Coop erative Congress. ""The section recommends that cooperative leaders recognize the great potentialities and the natural set-up (i.e. such advantages as organized groups with unrestricted freedom for study) the Church offers for education of its membership in cooperative principles and ideals.<query> who is the chairman of the cooperative league</query> ""The section strongly recommends that co operative leaders cooperate with and utilize these educational forces and influences in herent within the Church and the readiness of the Church to serve."" It is the unanimous opinion of the resolutions committee that this conven tion express its appreciation of the good work of the Cooperative Project under the WPA administration and with the collaboration o>f The Coopera tive League of the LLS.A., and further more, that we avail ourselves of the abundant research, educational and other useful material made possible through this cooperative project.

A. and its hospitality has been responsible for a most pleasant visit by dele gates and visitors, Therefore be it resolved that a vote of thanks and sincere appreciation be given the officiais, directors, employees and members of the Consumers Coopera tive Association for their efforts and success in executing complete arrangements for our worth while and happy visit to their community.<query> what is the purpose of the biennial congress of the cooperative league of the united states</query> Appreciation Recognizing the vast amount of work involved and the many problems encountered in the making of a program such as it has been our good fortune and pleasure to enjoy, Be It Resolved, that it is the desire of the dele gates and visitors in attendance at this Congress to express their thanks and appreciation to all those who contributed in any way to its success. We wish to especially commend the Discussion Group features which were so much enjoyed by all who participated in them. Bereavement Where it has pleased an all wise Providence dur ing the past two years to call ""from our midst our friends and fellow cooperators, F. H. Osborne, Mid land Cooperative Wholesale; H. V. Nurmi. Central Cooperative Wholesale; C. C. Talbot, Farmers Union Central Exchange; and Edward A. Filene, Credit Union National Association and Consumer Distri bution Corporation, it Is fitting and proper that we express our deep appreciation of their faithful services in behalf of the cause to which we have committed ourselves and to which they gave such whole-hearted devotion.<query> who is fh osborne</query> May their example and leadership encourage us and their memory inspire us to follow the trail which they as pioneers blazed in the development of a new social and economic system which will bring greater happiness, good will and peace in a world now torn with fear, hatred and insecurity. Therefore, be it resolved that this Congress adopt the following resolution: Resolved: that we the delegates and visitors ot the llth Biennial Congress of The Cooperative League of the U. S. A. here assembled express our deep regret at the passing of these our friends and fellow cooperators and that we further pledge our- % Consumers' Cooperation selves to continue to carry on the cause to which they had committed themselves. Our deepest sympathy is extended to their beloved ones and all who mourn their loss. World Peace Through Cooperation Whereas, the world has again been on the verge of another horrible war, and is still sorely troubled socially and economically, and Whereas, we believe the cooperative movement affords the best possible way to bring about the proper adjustments and to avoid the recurrence of these evils, Be It Resolved, that we express to the Interna tional Cooperative Alliance our sympathies and con cern for fellow cooperators in the troubled areas and.<query> what is the cooperative league</query> Be It Further Resolved, that we extend every op portunity for those dispossessed cooperators who reach this country to continue their cooperative activities here, and Be It Further Resolved, that the Congress urge the continued development of international coop erative exchange and trade by American Coopera tives, and Be It Further Resolved, that these experiences abroad cause us to pledge deeper devotion to the cooperative economy as a means to the end that people everywhere touched by it may live in peace, amity and comity. Education and Publicity Whereas a clear understanding and appreciation of the reasons for and the aims and purposes of Cooperation are the bed rock of its stability and of its intelligent, aggressive promotion and, Whereas, one of our greatest tasks and most promising opportunities is to so promote such un derstanding and appreciation as to definitely in fluence consumers into Cooperative behaviour, therefore, Be It Resolved, that we urge The Cooperative League of the U. S. A, and its affiliates to promote the teaching of Cooperation in all institutions of learning, and Be It Further Resolved, that the Congress of the U. S. A. and the Governments of the several states be likewise urged to foster the teaching of Coop eration by every practicable means available.<query> what is the purpose of cooperative economy</query> Distribution Evils and Cooperation Whereas, we are encouraged by the progress and growth in cooperatives since the last Congress and in full recognition of the power of the Cooperative Movement to eliminate for the benefit of Consumers many, and perhaps all of the deadening and devas tating restrictions in our production and distribu tion processes, and Whereas, we are convinced of the ability of co operative effort to curb effectively and to eliminate ultimately monopolies and their attendant evils, Be It Resolved, that the delegates here assembled urge aggressive militant efforts in the development of the Cooperative Economy, and Be It Further Resolved, that in order to make effective any attempt to eliminate said restrictions on distribution and to otherwise bring about con sumer benefits, we urge the Cooperative Movement to press toward the early establishment of our own financial institutions and capital structure, and Be It Further Resolved, that the Board of Direc tors be urged to appoint a committee to study these needs and to plan for cooperative financial institutions.<query> what is the role of cooperatives in the cooperative economy</query> Information on Cooperatives in U.S.A. U. S. Bureau of Census Whereas, there is growing evidence of the uni versal need and value of cumulative factual data on cooperative marketing and purchasing in the U. S. A. and Whereas, the Sample Census made in the spring of this year by the U. S. Bureau of Census amplified that need and value, and Whereas, there is grave danger of the Questions regarding cooperation being omitted from the final draft of the census schedule for 1940, December, 1938 Be It Therefore Resolved, that we urge that proper steps be taken to insure the collection and publication by the Bureau of Census of factual data and information relative to Marketing and Purchas ing Cooperatives in the U. S. A. Student Cooperatives Whereas student cooperatives now include over 100,000 members doing a total business over $3,375,- 000 annually, Be It Resolved, that all student Rochdale coop erative societies be encouraged to affiliate with the cooperative movement either through regional cooperative associations or through such other means as may be provided.<query> when was the cooperative census made</query> Christian Century.

What labor must do is to take on itself the burden of solving its ""consumer problem,"" which can only be done by the organization of voluntary consumer cooperatives. We do not know when we have read a truer statement relative to economic and political action than the following by Mr. H. G. Keeney, President of the Nebraska Farmers' Union and newly- elected ^Vice-Président of the National Farmers' Union: ""I do not think we are going to solve our economic problems through political action but through Co operation.<query> who is the president of the consumer cooperatives</query> We will get favorable and helpful legislation just about in propor tion to our economic strength and we develop our economic strength through Cooperation."" Spokesmen for Big Business have learned a few words which they repeat like parrots: ""Repeal Taxes,"" which real ly means ""lighten the load on the rich""; ""Balance the Budget,"" which really means ""reduce relief payments to the poor""; ""Get the government out of busi ness,"" which really means ""let utility rates rise."" An unusual statement was made by Cardinal Verdiere, Archbishop of Paris, as reported in the New York Times, The Cardinal said ""During the three social stages of slavery, serfdom and wage- earning through which it has passed, humanity has been obliged to make an incessant effort to throw off the chains that one of its groups has loaded upon the other, and revolutions in the last analysis only represent a new emancipation of the sacrificed classes.<query> what is the meaning of repeal taxes</query> When one studies closely these periodic crises that convulse the world, it will be found that they have no other object than to achieve greater equality and a fairer place for the indi vidual, that is to say, for everybody."" *vr!îfE^n to sPread the knowledge of the Consumers' Cooperative Movement, whereby the people, in uiuntary association, purchase and produce for their own use the things they need.

Economically, Mr. Scotford empha sizes the cash benefits to the members, and also adds ""The manager of a coop erative store confessed that it was far more satisfying to return dividends to his members than to make profits for him self."" Educationally, Dr. Coady declares, ""There is nothing which encourages in tellectual activity more than thinking which pays."" Mr. Scotford adds, after talking with members of cooperatives, ""Once they felt themselves lost in a hope less maze; now they are experiencing the thrill of being a part of a movement which is going places.""

What Big Busi ness says and what Big Business does is summarized below: 1—Big Business encourages private initiative. YET the development of monopolies, which is rapidly taking place, is destroying privaie initiative. 2—Big Business promotes sound industrial prac tices. YET industry produces shoddy and adulterated products and sells them on credit terms, both of which are the opposite of sound business practices.<query> what is the opposite of big business</query> 3—Big Business supports equitable employment relations. YET the LaFollette Committee in vestigation reveals that industry spends mil lions on a labor spy system which breaks down the foundation of friendly relations. 4—Big Business creates new and broader markets. YET Assistant Attorney General Jackson stated in a recent radio address that industry ""Priced itself out of the market"" instead ol creating broader markets. 5—Big Business makes contructive efforts to alle viate depression effects. YET industry lays off employees and continues to pay high salaries to officers and dividends to stockholders, which deepens rather than alleviates the depression effects. 6—Big Business supports sound government poli cies. YET Big Business violently opposes equitable taxation and social insurances as well as public utilities, which are the soundest kind of government economic policies. 7—Big Business cooperates with agriculture.

She went to The Cooperative League, at 167 \V. 12th St., New York City, and talked with Mr. Eugene R. Bowen, the general secretary, and Mr. Wallace J. Campbell, the assistant secretary.<query> what is the main cause of war</query> The opening conversation explained how little she knew of what was going on in the cooperatives of this country. She thought it best to admit this at once, knowing it would be found out in a very short time. Then she was shown a map with the location of the large wholesale cooperatives. They deal almost entirely in farm supplies, such as seed, feed, fer tilizer and gas and oil. Only a few of them have dealt in groceries but these are now expanding. The whole movement is in its infancy here in comparison with the way it has developed in Sweden and in England, where it serves not only the needs of the By Eleanor Roosevelt lower income group, but as a balance wheel to the general price level. After a short time. Dr. James Peter Warbasse, president of The Cooperative League, came in and announced he had just been giving his examinations at the only medical college which requires a knowledge of cooperative medicine, the Long Island College of Medicine and Surgery.<query> who is the president of the cooperative league</query> He feels this branch of medicine is still getting scant recognition, but as forty per cent of our people are either unable to avail themselves of medical services because of cost, or because they live where such services are impossible to obtain, it seems obvious that something in the nature of cooperative medical and dental services will have to be furnished. I would have liked to visit the cooper ative institute on the upper floor, but I was late and could only murmur that I hoped to return some-day, A dentist ap pointment kept creeping up on me in spite of my interest in the cooperative and finally I had to dash off. (Reprinted with permission of United Features Syndicate.) Mrs. Roosevelt (right) Dr. J. P. Warbasse (center) E. R. Bowen (left) February, 1938 19 A FARM LEADER LOOKS AHEAD Murray D. Executive Ohio Farm COOPERATIVE HIGHLIGHTS OF 1937 (Extracts from an article ""What<query> who was the founder of the cooperative medical institute</query> Will 1938 Bring Forth?"" in Ohio Farm Bureau News, January, 1938). EVERYBODY wants economic securi ty, a decent income, a permanent job. protection against accident and sickness, enough money to take care of one in old age and so forth. Enough for All Blessed as is this nation, particularly with natural resources, there is enough to provide everyone with the above desired -objectives. But because of the present economic and political system they are denied the great mass of people. And the people have within their own hands the tools to assure them. We must keep re peating that until it is accepted, and un dertake action to secure these desired objectives for the people. How are we going to get them? First'—organization. The individual is helpless in the present complex system of society. You can't go it alone.<query> what is the economic system of the present day</query> And as I have said so often—the cost of organization is never as great as the cost of the lack of it. Producer Organizations Needed We first need organization of groups who have a similarity of interests—farm ers, laborers, white collared workers, small business men. and others. You must Tiave producer organization first. Consumers Organization Needed Second—then after we have producer organizations developed we must find the community of interests between groups and work out a program of common ob jectives. That does not necessarily mean that the different groups will agree on every thing. That is not possible until we find •one common meeting-ground. There is such a common meeting- 20 ground but people are not ready to accent it as yet. We are all consumers—that s the only eventual common meetinq- ground for all our people. It's the only place where we have a complete similari ty of interest.<query> what is the difference between consumer organizations and producer organizations</query> But we have thought of ourselves so long as producers that \ve can't see the woods because of the trees —yet. We will some day. Farmers must find a common meetinq- ground with the laboring people for they constitute, with farmers, the great group of folks in America who have too low in comes. Consequently, we as farmers have a similar problem with the laboring peo ple, and somehow must find ways and means of working with them. Now be sure you understand me. I said the laboring people. I have the same re servations about some of the labor unions that you have. But they are here. They are the only organized groups represent ing (to whatever small or large degree of effectiveness) the American laboring man. Organize! Organize! Finally, economic power leads to polit ical power and in turn those two deter mine what our social development is to be.<query> what is the laboring people</query> So to me, we need organization first, and much stronger farm organizations than we have ever had to date. Then we need to work with other people in Amer ica who have a similarity of interests. Third, we need to develop our own eco nomic power. This will come through the development of cooperative services owned and controlled by the people who use them, with profits going back to those who made the business possible in the first place. This increases mass purchas ing power which is a primary need in America today. The tragedy of this whole situation is that people have within their own hands the tools to fashion their own destiny » they will but use them. However, we are making progress. Consumers' Cooperation NINETEEN thirty-seven was a year of marked cooperative progress, not nly because the cooperative movement rew in volume and membership and en tered new fields but also because it at tracted greater attention from the world at large than it had in any previous year.<query> what is the importance of cooperatives</query> With the Cooperative Wholesales Central Cooperative Wholesale, or ganized in 1917 with $15.50 capital, celebrated its 20th Anniversary with as sets of $262,000 and is supplying 140 co operative stores with $3,000,000 worth of goods a year. Consumers Cooperative Association, North Kansas City, established a coop erative grease factory and continued its shipments of co-op blended oil to co operatives in Europe. Midland Co-op Wholesale, Minnea polis, ended its tenth year with its volume ($3,000,000) ten times that of its first year; was shipping a 20-car trainload of petroleum products a day to local coop eratives; and made plans to add a gro cery department. Midland, CCA and CCW made a joint contract to take the complete output of an oil refinery in Oklahoma. The Farm Bureau Mutual Auto Insur ance Co., Columbus, became the 7th largest mutual casualty company in the U. S. Late in November it was granted a license to write auto insurance for co-<query> what year was midland co op wholesale established</query> operators in New York State. The Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Association passed the $5,000,000 mark for annual volume—the first time in its history. United Cooperatives, Inc., with headquarters in Indianapolis, completed construction of its new $150,000 oil com pounding plant and made plans for a smaller plant in Warren, Pennsylvania. Farmers Union Central Exchange, St. Paul, built its volume to well over $4,- 000,000 and is serving 240 retail cooper atives in the North Western states. Grange Cooperative Wholesale, Seat- Ue, strengthened the relationship between the Wholesale and the retail cooperatives uary, 1938 it serves by providing for election of directors directly from cooperative units rather than from corresponding Grange units. Co -op business was reported up 30% over 1936. Pacific Supply Cooperative, Walla Walla, Washington, and Consumers Co operatives Associated, Amarillo, Texas, showed steady gains.<query> where is the headquarters of the farmers union central exchange</query> CCA estimated on the basis of early returns that purchases were 50% larger than in 1936. Eastern Cooperative Wholesale, New York, opened its own warehouse in Sep tember, 1936, after acting as a brokerage buying agency for eastern co-ops for several years. In 1937 business increased 90% over its total for the previous year. The number of local organizations served jumped from 45 to 195, and the year's sales were expected to pass half a million dollars.

It can be used to treat extreme dryness (on elbows and other places prone to this problem), as a lip balm, and even as an eyebrow gel! Seriously, I shape my eyebrows using this stuff and it holds all day, better than products that are actually intended for that specific purpose. Totally worth every penny. Janet S Potomac, MD Customer since: 2002 3/20/2011 I've used this product for years. I use it on my extra dry hands, before putting on the moisture gloves, at night. Also, I use it on my cuticles, scratches, cuts, and even on the ends of my hair as a treatment. I feel the need to address the commment to reviewer who said she had it about a month before expiration, upon delivery.<query> what is the best product for dry hands</query> You should have called customer service so they could take care of you, before leaving that review. That isn't fair to this fine product. Hillary M Customer since: 2011 3/16/2011 I use it on my elbows and knees and now they are never dry and never look ashy! Anna S Brooklyn, New York Customer since: 2010 3/15/2011 This product is exactly what I needed during the winter months with sensitive, cracking hands. Its a little too thick for warmer months. Elizabeth S Tucson, Arizona Customer since: 2011 3/1/2011 This product is good, but it stinks a little, since the expiration date is 04/2011. I got the product this month, which means I only have about a month or so to finish this can.<query> when does a saline sulphate expire</query> It's very potent, so it will be a challenge for me to finish it all by 04/2011. So be sure that you can finish it by 04/2011 before you order or you might be luckier than me to get one that is not expiring so soon. Mckenzy L Customer since: 2010 1/15/2011 There are not enough compliments that I can give to this product! It has SO many uses that I'm still discovering more each day. I got second degree burns all down my leg and I was worried about scarring, so once my skin was healed I began to put this shea butter on it. A week later, I noticed the redness of the scar had lightened up quite a bit and the edges softened. This really is a wonderful product. Thank you, L'occitane, for giving me my skin back!<query> what is shea butter used for</query> Jill F Lumberton, Texas Customer since: 2011 10/13/2010 This product saved the day!! I recently had a head cold where I used about a box of lotion-added tissues each day. Even though the tissues contained lotion my nose was still very red and irritated. One night I decided to put the pure shea butter on my nose and, voila!, in the morning my nose was so much better. This stuff works wonders. Margee S Santa Clara, California Customer since: 2010 5/20/2010 Must have multipurpose product for winter. Kathleen B Batavia, Ohio Customer since: 2009 4/23/2010 So much has already been said about this product, but, honestly, it is truly phenomenal. I use it everywhere and love it because its organic, fragrance free and very high quality.<query> what is shea butter used for</query> I agree with another reviewer that quality of shea butter varies greatly and this is absolutely the best I've used. It is fabulous for sensitive skin, dry skin, aging skin, hair, etc. It is very protective and can even be used sparingly as a daily moisturizer...the greatest! Ginger C Customer since: 2005 4/17/2010 My favorite all purpose moisturizer for head to toe! It may seem pricey but the tin is generous in size & will last many months. Alison G Auburn, Washington Customer since: 2010 3/18/2010 I am sad to say I will no longer be buying this product. Every tin I have bought since it was introduced as ""organic"" has to be tested prior to purchasing, to determine if it is rancid or not.<query> what is the best moisturizer for dry skin</query> The product smells extremely bad soon after purchase. I will find something else. I can no longer use it on my face, which is what I relied on it for. It just smells awful. Please bring back the regular Shea Butter in this size! Lori S Eugene, Oregon Customer since: 2006 3/12/2010 I have loved Loccitane products, primarily the 100% shea butter for several years. However, I feel the need to warn others that if you invest in this large jar, expect it to go rancid. My jar was dated 12/2010, and I've had it a year, but customer service said you have to use it all in 6 months. I can't find that anywhere on the product or website, and they refuse to replace it. Don't trust the date on your tin.<query> does locitane shea butter smell bad</query> After giving Loccitane nearly $1,000 in sales, now I'm switching to coconut oil. Jacqueline J Goldsboro, North Carolina Customer since: 2009 2/24/2010 This product is excellent. I am a african american female and I have a perm (chemical) in my hair. I use this product to oil my scalp and my hair is healthier than I can ever remember it being (except for virgin hair). I also use it all over my body including my face. I will not say that this is the best shea butter that there is but I WILL say that this is the best that I have ever used and I have tried at least a dozen and a half so called 100% shea butter products and this is the BEST! Ya-Mei Y Pittsburgh, PA Customer since: 2004 2/8/2010 Thanks for previous reviewers.<query> what is the best shea butter for hair</query> I have adult eczema, and this product is one of a few things gentle enough for my skin! Plus, it's not as greasy as other eczema products which moisturize but also cause breakouts easily. Glenn M Customer since: 2010 1/20/2010 i just had my tatttoo done. after 3 days my skin was peeling and scabbing badly. i applied Shea Butter for 2 days. and it works! my skin became soft and supple. no itchy and burning sensation anymore. my tattoo and my skin are now looking marvelous! i have kept using it for more than a year. now thinking of having another tattoo :) Sara R Fredericksburg, Virginia Customer since: 2009 12/31/2009 I have this size as well as a larger size and really love this stuff!<query> does shea butter help eczema</query> It's especially great to put on your legs after shaving and is nice because it doesn't really have a smell. It just feels good! Jean Baptiste V fresh Meadows, New York Customer since: 2009 12/6/2009 I love it! That's all I can say. Janiqua S Tallahassee, Florida Customer since: 2009 12/2/2009 I have used this for my face and my skin. I apply it at night on my face after I cleanse. I also apply it on the dry patches that I have on my face in the morning after applying the Shea Butter 24 hour Ultra Rich face cream and the Shea Butter SPF. I like to mix it with the Almond Supple skin oil when applying to my body so it is not too rich. This is great for moisturizing your feet.<query> what is the best face cream to put on your legs</query> A little goes a long way. Rachel A Customer since: 2009 11/14/2009 This tin of 100% shea butter may not be glamorous, but it is extraordinarily gentle and versatile. It soothes dry lips; it’s lovely for taming frizz and for adding shine to hair. I can apply it lightly to dry areas on my face, and my grumpy acne-prone skin never complains. In my fun experimenting, I discovered the benefits of adding it to a dollop of body lotion to enhance the lotion’s moisturizing properties. Dry, cracked heels soak it up. Best of all, it’s produced ethically and responsibly! Aisha A Boulder, Colorado Customer since: 2008 7/26/2009 This is very nice product if you hate the stickiness of petroleum jelly Evelyn T Potomac, Maryland Customer since: 2009 6/29/2009 I was disappointed when I received these that they have an unpleasant odor like grease that has gone bad.<query> what is shea butter used for</query> This powerful moisturizer is retrieved from the fruit of African Shea trees, and celebrated world-wide for encouraging cellular renewal and repairing the hydrolipidic film, thereby softening, soothing and comforting skin.

If these are not fresh, they need to add a fragrance to cover up the smell. L'Occitane Response: We are sorry to hear about your experience with this product. Our Shea Butter is 100% organic so it will expire. If you purchased this directly from L'Occitane, call Customer Service (1-888-623-2880) to receive a replacement.

This has done wonders for me. I highly recommend this product Katrina L Customer since: 2002 4/24/2009 My mother has had cancer twice and has beat it both times; now her granddaughter has a tumor and shes only 12. This is her second operation also. They both LOVE shea butter,because it doesn't wash off when she does dishes and she LOVES it,but she can't afford it.<query> does shea butter help eczema</query> She also lost her husband and just went through a knee surgery a couple of months ago and she still hasn't healed;I just HOPE and PRAY it's not cancer again. This is way I know she should win; she's the best MOM and GRANNY EVER........... Julie B Customer since: 2009 4/23/2009 This is my daughter's all-time favorite moisturizer, winter and summer! I got her some and now her boyfriend uses it as well because it doesn't have a strong perfumy fragrance! He's a football player and has dry skin so appreciated that this Shea Butter is something he can use daily. There is nothing like this out there, and believe me, we've looked! Marilyn M Customer since: 2008 4/23/2009 My mother introduced me to this marvelous treatment!<query> what is my mom's favorite moisturizer</query> The butter is smooth, rich and melts into your skin. You don't need to have dry skin to benefit from this pure shea butter. It is long lasting and you will see the benefits from using it immediately. Rub it over your hands and feet for a luxurious treat! TAMMY L Customer since: 2009 2/17/2009 I put this on my face at night and I wake up with buttery soft, glowing skin! Just heat it in your fingers and gently press it in! I'm 33 with combination skin and this is my staple for New England winters. It's an incredible product and I love that it's fairly traded with the women of Africa. What a great product and great company! KIMBERLY R RIDGELAND, South Carolina Customer since: 2007 2/12/2009 I have psoriasis really bad & have tried everything, even $400 prescriptions.<query> what is shea butter used for</query> This is the only thing that actually gets rid of my psoriasis completely.

Michotte N New York, New York Customer since: 2008 11/23/2008 I love love love this product. I use it on my feet and my nail lady told me I have one of the softest feet she has seen and I am on my feet all day in my job. My hands also don't show my age and I have to wash my hands a lot being a health care professional. I could practically sell this better than the sales clerk. In fact, I did that, sell it to another customer in the store. I am just sad that it discontinued the lavender and verbena line, love the smell.<query> what makes your hands soft</query> Giving it as gifts again this year. Candace R Customer since: 2008 11/20/2008 I have really itchy, sensitive skin, and this is one of the only things I can find that soothes it! I love it! Gena D Chicago, IL Customer since: 2012 11/10/2008 I love the mini shea butter tin! I use it on my lips as a moisturizer. It is by far the best lip balm I have ever used. It keeps my lips moist without feeling goopy or gunky. And it stays on for quite awhile before I have to reapply. It's very smooth, so if I want some color in the winter, I will apply it first & then apply a lipstick on top. It's also the perfect size to put in your pocket.<query> what is the best lip balm for lips</query> I got my boyfriend hooked on the mini shea butter, too! It is the only lip balm he'll use. Denise S Beckley, WV Customer since: 2003 8/3/2008 This is the BEST product for prevention of stretch marks due to pregnancy. I used L'Occitane's 100% Shea Butter everyday after my shower during my two pregnancies, and I'm happy to say, that I never GOT even ONE stretch mark! A truly remarkable miracle! So my advice to expecting mothers: use this product! Danielle B Glen Burnie, MD Customer since: 2007 7/31/2008 I love to put this on my lips. It provides wonderful hydration all year round but especially during winter. Kay S Customer since: 2008 7/31/2008 We have a 3 year-old son that was born with extremely dry skin.<query> what is the best lip balm for stretch marks</query> I tried every prescription drug. I would get his skin under control & a week later dry itchy patches would form again. He loves the water & would cry when we had to limit his water time. Apparently, moisture makes dry patches worse. A friend told me about L'Occitane organic shea butter and it has made my son's dry skin dissapear. I use it religiously every day. Our quality of life is wonderful. We are no longer sleepless in Seattle. Caroline N portland, Oregon Customer since: 2008 7/24/2008 I have always had dry cracked skin and have tried different products with little success, even one recommended by a dermatologist.

Amani R Elmhurst, New York Customer since: 2012 1/14/2012 This stuff is absolutely amazing and is what turned me on to L'Occitaine. This has become the staple of my skin moisturizing.<query> what is l'occitaine made of</query> The doctors prescribed medicine with a strong chemical base that I didn't want on my baby's skin.

The salesperson suggested I try pure shea butter. It worked! L'Occitane is our everyday product! Sharon S Redmond, Washington Customer since: 2010 7/21/2008 This is my favorite L'Occitane product. I've had chronically dry feet for many years. Once I discovered the 100% Shea Butter and started applying it nightly the problem was solved.

Joy C Paramus, New Jersey Customer since: 2008 7/14/2008 This is giant but it goes away so quickly! It's a great moisturizer or any part of the body and works well for cuts, too. I use it for paper cuts and it leaves no scar whatsoever. Also because I manually do all my dishwashing it's great for after-dishes or handwashing clothes. I absolutely recommend it along with the tiny one for bringing this everywhere with you! Amy K hampton, Virginia Customer since: 2008 7/14/2008 This is by far my favorite product from L'Occitane.<query> what is the best moisturizer for cuts</query> There is nothing else like it for dry skin.

My hair is relaxed and sometimes dry at the ends. The Shea butter softed and condtioned my dry and brittle ends. This product is very versatile. I've used it on my hair and also as a foot cream and already I feel and see the results. Just a little bit goes a long way. It's worth every penny. The hair conditoner and shampoos are also a great buy. Radha R Sunnyvale, CA Customer since: 2006 4/10/2008 I JUST LOVE THE SHEA BUTTER...

Source: esha Research, Food Processor for Windows, Version 7.8M Whole Grains and Fish Highly Protective against Childhood Asthma<query> how much fiber in a cup of oatmeal</query> While no association between asthma and intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was found (a result at odds with other studies that have supported a link between antioxidant intake, particularly vitamins C and E, and asthma), the children's intake of both whole grains and fish was significantly linked to incidence of wheezing and current asthma. In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed. Phenolics, powerful antioxidants that work in multiple ways to prevent disease, are one major class of phytonutrients that have been widely studied. Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods.

Tips for Preparing and Cooking Tips for Preparing Quinoa While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands. To ensure that the saponins have been completely removed, taste a few seeds. If they still have a bitter taste, continue the rinsing process.<query> how long can you keep quinoa in the refrigerator</query> This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Quinoa provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System.

In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients. Because quinoa is a very good source of manganese as well as a good source of magnesium, folate, and phosphorus, this ""grain"" may be especially valuable for persons with migraine headaches, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Help for Migraine Headaches If you are prone to migraines, try adding quinoa to your diet. Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years.

Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5.

Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women.

clueweb12-0807wb-18-17189,9,2,"Why Windows Wins | Linux Magazine Distros SysAdmin Mobile Software Datacenter HPC Development LMTV Why Windows Wins Windows Vista: The kinda boring, soon to be globally dominant operating system. By Bryan Richard Thursday, February 1st, 2007 General availability for Microsoft Windows Vista went live this week to reserved applause. The reviews seem to think it’s a decent upgrade to the OS but not something you need to camp out overnight at Best Buy for. What fascinates me most about the Vista launch is the limited number of computers in the world that are capable of running the software today. How many companies can spend $6 billion on a product that can only be deployed on an estimated 15% of the world’s computers?<query> why does windows win</query> It’s like building one billion cars and there being only 5 roads to drive them on. It’s seems a bit reckless in one sense. But it’s also rather brilliant. Windows Vista isn’t so much a new operating system as it is demand generation for new hardware. It’s a strategy that ultimately will prove successful because it enlists the support ofeveryone selling hardware. No Room for Change Microsoft is in bit of an awkward position for a software company. They can’t really produce a revolutionary computing experience that deviates too far from the Windows of previous releases. It’s not for lack of talent or manpower but because with such a large install base, introducing anything that’s too foreign, regardless if it’s better or not, would throw users into a tailspin. Look at it this way, if everyone that was running Windows suddenly switched, at the same time, to the Mac you’d have 90% of the world’s computer users spending the next 30 days just trying to find their files.<query> why is windows vista a good operating system</query> Anyone that’s had to answer the question, “Linux… that can get eBay, right?” will know this to be true. That’s not a comment on the intelligence of your average computer user but an observation that most users can only tolerate change in very small doses. And it’s this wave computing inertia that Microsoft is able to ride and Desktop Linux struggles to stay afloat in. So, if you’re Microsoft and you can’t create something so new that in and of itself it’s inherently compelling, what are your options? Oddly enough the best option seems to be to create something that most people can’t use. Built for the Computers of 2009! Let’s quickly compare the hardware requirements of Windows Vista and the most recent commercial desktop available, Novell SUSE Enterprise Linux Desktop 10. Figures pulled from the respective vendor’s websites: Windows Vista Premium Ready SLED 10 Processor 1 GHz 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor Intel Pentium III 500 MHz or higher processor System Memory 1 GB 512 MB GPU Windows Aero Capable DirectX 9-class GPU that supports: A WDDM Driver Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware 32 bits per pixel Adequate graphics memory n/a Graphics Memory 128 MB n/a HDD 40 GB n/a HDD Free Space >15 GB 2.5 GB Optical Drive DVD-ROM Drive n/a Truth be told, I’ve got an ancient IBM ThinkPad 600 lying around here somewhere that would probably run SLED 10 well enough — that’s the great thing about Linux, it’s light enough to run on just about anything.<query> what is the minimum hardware requirements for linux desktop</query> But if you are a hardware manufacturer, which column above you get more excited? Windows Vista will help PC vendors sell more desktops than Linux will. Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer told Reuters, “We will see an uptick (in PC sales). Sales will be stronger than they otherwise would have been.” If you’re cost-conscious or your department has a tight IT budget, you might disagree, but Ballmer is correct. And not only that, but PC vendors will drive the majority of new Vista sales. While Microsoft won’t spin down the marketing engine anytime soon, in a sense, their work was over once they released Vista because it created so much incentive for hardware vendors to sell Vista for them. People Like to Buy Stuff Regardless if it’s a home user or a enterprise department of 1,000, people like to buy things.<query> what is the microsoft ceo saying about vista</query> The only thing they perhaps like more than buying things is the justification to make a purchase. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading a computer, Vista just gave you, without a doubt, the answer to every question related to “Why do we need to buy a new PC?” For someone like myself that has purchased exactly three computers in the last 10 years, it seems a little foolish, but it’s how the majority of the PC buying patterns work. On top of buying habits, Microsoft will add some additional incentive in the form of discontinuing free support for XP in 2008 to draw in the hold-outs, but in general, the trend will follow that if you’re running the previous OS from Microsoft, you’ll soon be running the latest. I can see no reason why this should suddenly change. Linux on the Desktop Linux on the desktop needs strong support from groups outside the Linux community and I’m not sure that exists yet.<query> why do we need to buy a new computer</query> Those who have already sampled the Kool-Aid have drank deeply. I think the biggest question is whether the commercial Linux distributions can prove to the PC vendors that it is in their best interest to support Linux on the desktop. I for one used the same Linux laptop for five years before switching to the Mac. No PC vendor wants to hear that. Then again, no Linux user wants to hear that their favorite distro is a suddenly a giant piece of bloat-ware. It’s a fine line but one that needs to be walked. Otherwise Linux on the desktop will continue to sit somewhere South of Apple’s 4-5% market share. That’s Apple Inc., mind you, who recently changed their name from Apple Computer having realized that in most cases the world beats a path to your door when you build a better mousetrap.<query> what is the market share of linux on desktop</query> But maybe not for a better desktop.

clueweb12-0003wb-78-25177,9,2,"How to Give Linux Away LG #125 ...making Linux just a little more fun! <-- prev | next --> How to Give Linux Away By Scott Ruecker As a community, we would like to see large computer manufacturers sell PCs with Linux already on them. Is this the only option worth considering? I work as a sales representative for one of the large PC manufacturers, at many different technology retail stores. Three years ago, I heard about Open Source and Linux. My first exposure came in the form of the Firefox browser. When I speak with customers, I talk about my experiences using Linux. I ask them if their computer is running slow, and the answer is always ""Yes"". They tell me how it is running really slow no matter what they do, or how they can't seem to create any free room on their hard drive.<query> what is linux given away</query> If I do it right, they do not even feel their own shift in opinion or preference. I could expand on this some more, and I will, but I thought that giving you the basics of what I do might help others in getting past theFUD without alienating the person you are talking to. Changing someone's opinion or stance without making them feel stupid takes practice - and I get a lot of practice. Talkback: Discuss this article with The Answer Gang Scott Ruecker a.k.a. ""sharkscott"" lives in Phoenix, Arizona; he is a Special Education Major at Arizona State University and claims to have taken way too many History Classes. He works as a sales rep for a large OEM, tries to pronounce ""Linux"" correctly and plays Drums in a rock-n-roll band every Saturday night.<query> who is gang scott</query> First exposed to OSS when he heard about ""This Linux Thing"" in 2002. Got his start on the Fedora Cores, Ku-Ubuntu and then to SuSE. Has used SuSE since 9.1 and thinks he likes it. Copyright © 2006, Scott Ruecker. Released under the Open Publication license unless otherwise noted in the body of the article. Linux Gazette is not produced, sponsored, or endorsed by its prior host, SSC, Inc. Published in Issue 125 of Linux Gazette, April 2006 <-- prev | next --> Home FAQ Site Map Mirrors Translations Search Archives Authors Contact Us Home > April 2006 (#125) > Article<query> when was linux gazette published</query> People often ask me if MS-Office comes with the computer, and I say ""No, but have you ever heard ofOpenOffice.org?"" I tell them how it can read and save the MS formats, and how I have been using it at college even though MS-Office dominates on campus. I tell them what it can do and that it doesn't cost a dime. That usually gets their attention. I also will often hear the customer say, ""As soon as I get home I am going to throw the old computer away"". What I say at that point - and what I think we should all be saying - is ""You know that old computer that can't run Windows the way you need it to anymore? Give it to me, and I'll fix it up and give it to someone or some family that does not have a computer."" I have had several conversations with customers that have led to them giving me their old computers when buying a new one.<query> what is the name of the program that reads ms files</query> I fixed one up and gave it to a friend of mine who lives on a ranch in Colorado, and because of it he has been able to stay in contact with friends and family here in Phoenix. What if we all did that? All of us? What if everyone who used Linux fixed up an old computer, configured it for common uses, and gave it to someone or some family who did not have one? Think about it. We would not only double the number of people who use Linux, but have a very positive effect on society. We all know that having a computer in the home makes everyone who uses it read better. It is my belief that that the ability to read well does as much or more for that person as going to school. Someone who knows how to read can find what they need to learn the skills and teach themselves anything they want.<query> what if everyone who used linux fixed up an old computer and configured it for common uses If a child can be positively affected by having a computer, so can an entire family. I am not trying to proclaim some kind of ""call to arms"" to join me in some crusade - not at all. I just want to share some of the things I say, and some of the questions I ask, that have introduced Open Source Software to new people in a positive way. As the saying goes, ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression"". I hope that what I say in this article will help you make that first impression a good one. Over the last two years, I have gone from not knowing how to pronounce ""Linux"" correctly to... well, still not knowing how to pronounce SuSE correctly. You gotta admit, though - fixing up and giving away computers is at least good karma (I hope).<query> how to pronounce sue correctly</query> Part 2 - Changing Opinions If someone has already made up their mind not to give something new a try, then there is no sense in wasting your time trying make them re-think their decision. However, there are plenty of other people around - and some of them are only held back by excuses. Among those who give such excuses, there are those who are just repeating what they have heard or read and really do not have any of their own information or experience to draw from. They are easy to pick out - once you have heard hundreds of different people say almost the exact same thing like I have. It's not that hard; all you have to do is ask a few questions and you can easily determine if they are just repeating what they have heard or actually have their own reasons for not wanting to give Linux a try.<query> why do people say they won't give linux a try</query> Here is what I do: Ask them if they use IE, WMP (Windows Media Player), Quicktime, iTunes, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access... and always ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they are using. Make sure that you always end with the Anti-Viruses - trust me, I'll tell you why in a moment. You will find that roughly 99% of the people you talk to do not even use all of those programs I listed - and very, very few use any programs that are not on that list. Most people only use IE, Word, WMP, and maybe Quicktime a little - and whatever Anti-Virus software they have installed. Ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they use. After you ask, most people will repeat it back to you saying, ""How many types of Anti-Virus programs do I use?"" ""Do you have more than one Anti-Virus program on your computer?"" Some people do not - but many do use more than one.<query> what programs do people use on computers</query> This is where I tell them, ""When I ran Windows, I used Ad-Aware, Zone Alarm, AVG, McAfee (the free version), Spybot, Spywareblaster, Spyware-Doctor, Webroot, and Registry Mechanic."" Which is true: I had all of them on my computer at the same time and between them I could keep my system fairly safe. Fairly. Ask them if they have ever heard of Firefox. Some will ask, ""What is Firefox?"" - ""Firefox is a browser."" ""What is a browser?"" - ""It is a program that you use to surf the Internet."" ""You mean like IE?"" - ""Exactly, only it is a lot safer than IE."" This is where I go into the features, how it imports favorites and why it is safer than IE.<query> what is the difference between ie and firefox</query> Something like: ""Because it is not a part of the operating system, it is a lot harder for spyware to damage your system when using Firefox."" Again, technically true. Ask them if they have ever heard of OpenOffice.org. Then say to them, ""OpenOffice allows you to view, modify, save, and send the changed document in MS format and it does not cost $500... actually, it does not cost a dime."" I will tell you that a lot of people are not happy when they buy a new computer and then are told by the store employee that it does not come with Word or Office - and that if they want it, it will cost hundreds of dollars. If you can get people to listen to you about OpenOffice's compatibility features and price, of lack thereof, many will not leave until they get the web address from you.<query> does openoffice cost a dime</query> If I can get most of the way through these steps, then I know I can re-visit the Linux question and stand a chance of success. I can show them that it just might be something that could work for them. When I explain the Root and User separation built into Linux - how it makes the computer safer and that they will not need multiple Anti-Virus programs or have to re-format their hard drive every six months because Windows does not actually delete anything - they start to actually look at the retail Linux box I have already handed them. Is this system perfect? No. You may talk about one thing before another or skip over something or do it in reverse - every conversation is unique. I want to inform them of choices they may not have known of, open them up to new ways of doing something and not make them feel like they were wrong or stupid.<query> why is linux used</query>"

This will help your body to get into a sleep rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep and get up in the morning. Establish a bedtime routine. This could include meditation, deep breathing, usingaromatherapy or essential oils or indulging in a massage from your partner. The key is to find something that makes you feel relaxed, then repeat it each night to help you release the tensions of the day. Don't drink any fluids within 2 hours of going to bed. This will reduce the likelihood of needing to get up and go to the bathroom, or at least minimize the frequency. Go to the bathroom right before bed. This will reduce the chances that you'll wake up to go in the middle of the night.<query> how to get to sleep at night</query> Eat a high-protein snack several hours before bed. This can provide the L-tryptophan needed for your melatonin and serotonin production. Also eat a small piece of fruit. This can help the tryptophan cross your blood-brain barrier. Avoid before-bed snacks, particularly grains and sugars. These will raise your blood sugar and delay sleep. Later, when blood sugar drops too low (hypoglycemia), you may wake up and be unable to fall back asleep. Take a hot bath, shower or sauna before bed. When your body temperature is raised in the late evening, it will fall at bedtime, facilitating slumber. The temperature drop from getting out of the bath signals your body it’s time for bed. Wear socks to bed. Feet often feel cold before the rest of the body because they have the poorest circulation.<query> what to eat before bedtime</query> Astudy has shown that wearing socks reduces night wakings. As an alternative, you could place a hot water bottle near your feet at night. Wear an eye mask to block out light. As discussed earlier, it is very important to sleep in as close to complete darkness as possible. That said, it's not always easy to block out every stream of light using curtains, blinds or drapes, particularly if you live in an urban area (or if your spouse has a different schedule than you do). In these cases, an eye mask can be helpful. Put your work away at least one hour before bed (preferably two hours or more). This will give your mind a chance to unwind so you can go to sleep feeling calm, not hyped up or anxious about tomorrow's deadlines.<query> what to wear to sleep at night</query> No TV right before bed. Even better, get the TV out of the bedroom or even completely out of the house. It’s too stimulating to the brain, preventing you from falling asleep quickly. TV disrupts your pineal gland function. Listen to relaxation CDs. Some people find the sound of white noise or nature sounds, such as the ocean or forest, to be soothing for sleep. An excellent relaxation/meditation option to listen to before bed is theInsight audio CD. Another favorite is the Sleep Harmony CD, which uses a combination of advanced vibrational technology and guided meditation to help you effortlessly fall into deep delta sleep within minutes. The CD works on the principle of “sleep wave entrainment” to assist your brain in gearing down for sleep. Read something spiritual or uplifting. This may help you relax.<query> what to listen to before bed</query> Don't read anything stimulating, such as a mystery or suspense novel, which has the opposite effect. In addition, if you are really enjoying a suspenseful book, you might be tempted to go on reading for hours, instead of going to sleep! Journaling. If you often lay in bed with your mind racing, it might be helpfulkeep a journal and write down your thoughts before bed. Personally, I have been doing this for 15 years, but prefer to do it in the morning when my brain is functioning at its peak and my cortisol levels are high. Lifestyle Suggestions That Enhance Sleep Reduce or avoid as many drugs as possible. Many drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, may adversely effect sleep. In most cases, the condition causing the drugs to be taken in the first place can be addressed by following guidelines elsewhere on my web site.<query> what to do to help you sleep</query> Avoid caffeine. At least one study has shown that, in some people, caffeine is not metabolized efficiently, leaving you feeling its effects long after consumption. So, an afternoon cup ofcoffee or tea will keep some people from falling asleep at night. Be aware that some medications contain caffeine (for example, diet pills). Avoid alcohol. Although alcohol will make you drowsy, the effect is short lived and you will often wake up several hours later, unable to fall back asleep. Alcohol will also keep you from entering the deeper stages of sleep, where your body does most of its healing. Make certain you are exercising regularly. Exercising for at least 30 minutes per day can improve your sleep. However, don't exercise too close to bedtime or it may keep you awake. Studies show exercising in the morning is the best if you can manage it.<query> how to sleep better</query> Lose excess weight. Being overweight can increase your risk of sleep apnea, which can seriously impair your sleep. (CLICK HERE for my nutritional recommendations.) Avoid foods you may be sensitive to. This is particularly true for sugar, grains, and pasteurized dairy. Sensitivity reactions can cause excess congestion, gastrointestinal upset, bloating and gas, and other problems. Have your adrenals checked by a good natural medicine clinician . Scientists have found that insomnia may be caused by adrenal stress. If you are menopausal or perimenopausal, get checked out by a good natural medicine physician. The hormonal changes at this time may cause sleep problems if not properly addressed. If All Else Fails My current favorite fix for insomnia is Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). Most people can learn the basics of this gentle tapping technique in a few minutes.<query> what causes sleep apnea</query> EFT can help balance your body's bioenergy system and resolve some of the emotional stresses that are contributing to your insomnia at a very deep level. The results are typically long lasting and improvement is remarkably rapid. Increase your melatonin. Ideally it is best to increase levels naturally with exposure to bright sunlight in the daytime (along with full spectrum fluorescent bulbs in the winter) and absolute complete darkness at night. If that isn’t possible, you may want to consider a melatonin supplement. In scientific studies, melatonin has been shown to increase sleepiness, help you fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep, decrease restlessness, and reverse daytime fatigue. Melatonin is a completely natural substance, made by your body, and has many health benefits in addition to sleep. I prefer to use a sublingual melatonin product because it is absorbed much faster and therefore works more quickly.<query> what is melatonin supplement</query> I offer amelatonin spray on my website that I believe is one of the very best on the market.

Six to eight hours per night seems to be the optimal amount of sleep for most adults, and too much or too little can have adverse effects on your health. Sleep deprivation is such a chronic condition these days that you might not even realize you suffer from it. Science has now established that a sleep deficit can have serious, far reaching effects on your health. For example, interrupted or impaired sleep can: Dramatically weaken your immune system Accelerate tumor growth—tumors grow two to three times faster in laboratory animals with severe sleep dysfunctions Cause a pre-diabetic state, making you feel hungry even if you’ve already eaten, which canwreak havoc on your weight Seriously impair your memory; even a single night of poor sleep—meaning sleeping only 4 to 6 hours—can impact your ability to think clearly the next day Impair your performance on physical or mental tasks, and decrease your problem solving ability When your circadian rhythms are disrupted, your body produces less melatonin (a hormone AND an antioxidant) and hasless ability to fight cancer, since melatonin helps suppress free radicals that can lead to cancer.<query> effects of sleep deprivation</query> This is why tumors grow faster when you sleep poorly. Impaired sleep can also increase stress-related disorders, including: Heart disease Stomach ulcers Constipation Mood disorders like depression Sleep deprivation prematurely ages you by interfering with your growth hormone production, normally released by your pituitary gland during deep sleep (and during certain types of exercise, such asPeak Fitness Technique). Growth hormone helps you look and feel younger. One study has even shown that people with chronic insomnia have a three timesgreater risk of dying from any cause. Lost sleep is lost forever, and persistent lack of sleep has a cumulative effect when it comes to disrupting your health. Poor sleep can make your life miserable, as most of you probably know. The good news is, there are many natural techniques you can learn to restore your “sleep health.” Whether you have difficulty falling asleep, waking up too often, or feeling inadequately rested when you wake up in the morning—or maybe you simply want to improve the quality of your sleep—you are bound to find some relief from my tips and tricks below.<query> why does sleep deprivation make you tired</query> **If you are interested in more information about sleep or any of the 33 items listed, I invite you to delve into the links that follow, which are grouped by subject. Optimizing Your Sleep Sanctuary Sleep in complete darkness, or as close to it as possible . Even the tiniest bit of light in the room can disrupt your internal clock and your pineal gland's production of melatonin and serotonin. Even the tiniest glow from your clock radio could be interfering with your sleep. Thiswill help decrease your risk of cancer. Close your bedroom door, and get rid of night-lights. Refrain from turning on any light at all during the night, even when getting up to go to the bathroom. Cover up your clock radio. Cover your windows—I recommend using blackout shades or drapes. All life evolved in response to predictable patterns of light and darkness, called circadian rhythms.<query> how to improve sleep</query> Modern day electrical lighting has significantly betrayed your inner clock by disrupting your natural rhythms. Little bits of light pass directly through your optic nerve to your hypothalamus, which controls your biological clock. Light signals your brain that it’s time to wake up and starts preparing your body for ACTION. Keep the temperature in your bedroom no higher than 70 degrees F . Many people keep their homes and particularly their upstairs bedrooms too warm. Studies show that theoptimal room temperature for sleep is quite cool, between 60 to 68 degrees. Keeping your room cooler or hotter can lead to restless sleep. When you sleep, your body’s internal temperature drops to its lowest level, generally about four hours after you fall asleep. Scientists believe a cooler bedroom may therefore be most conducive to sleep, since it mimics your body’s natural temperature drop.<query> what temperature should a bedroom be</query> Check your bedroom for electro-magnetic fields (EMFs). These can disrupt the pineal gland and the production of melatonin and serotonin, and may have other negative effects as well. To do this, you need a gauss meter. You can find various models online, starting around $50 to $200. Some experts even recommend pulling your circuit breaker before bed to kill all power in your house. Move alarm clocks and other electrical devices away from your bed . If these devices must be used, keep them as far away from your bed as possible, preferably at least 3 feet. Remove the clock from view. It will only add to your worry when you stare at it all night... 2 a.m. ...3 a.m. ... 4:30 a.m. Avoid using loud alarm clocks. It is very stressful on your body to be suddenly jolted awake.<query> how far away should alarm clock be from bed</query> If you are regularly getting enough sleep, an alarm may even be unnecessary. I gave up my alarm clock years ago and now use a sun alarm clock. The Sun Alarm™ SA-2002 provides an ideal way to wake up each morning if you can't wake up with the REAL sun. Combining the features of a traditional alarm clock (digital display, AM/FM radio, beeper, snooze button, etc) with a special built-in light that gradually increases in intensity, this amazing clock simulates a natural sunrise. It also includes a sunset feature where the light fades to darkness over time, which is ideal for anyone who has trouble falling asleep. Reserve your bed for sleeping. If you are used to watching TV or doing work in bed, you may find it harder to relax and drift off to sleep, so avoid doing these activities in bed.<query> what is the best way to wake up</query> Consider separate bedrooms. Recent studies suggest, for many people, sharing a bed with a partner (or pets) can significantly impair sleep, especially if the partner is a restless sleeper or snores. If bedfellows are consistently interfering with your sleep, you may want toconsider a separate bedroom. Preparing for Bed Get to bed as early as possible. Your body (particularly your adrenal system) does a majority of its recharging between the hours of 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. In addition, your gallbladder dumps toxins during this same period. If you are awake, the toxins back up into your liver, which can further disrupt your health. Prior to the widespread use of electricity, people would go to bed shortly after sundown, as most animals do, and which nature intended for humans as well. Don't change your bedtime.<query> when should you go to bed</query>"

Commenter Mynx Location Date and time April 17, 2012, 11:30AM Nonsense! I share a room with my husband (shock, horror!) and we do more than have sex and sleep in there. We often lie on our bed and watch shows, read or play cards etc. He sleeps until he's woken and I can hardly get any sleep at all. I think that one solution does not work across the board and that every person is unique with our own set of problems and reasons why we do or don't sleep. It's probably best to try a range of things and if you're still not sleeping to seek medical help. Commenter dlh Location Melbourne Date and time April 17, 2012, 1:15PM So what, C, you want a medal?<query> why do i not sleep</query> Everyone is different, plus people change, I have found as I get older that I do the old waking up around 3am after having a solid sleep and then can't get back to sleep. I was told some of this could be menopause and I know some of it may be stress. You can't help but think stuff when you're wide awake at that hour. Plus I'm a very recurring, vivid dreamer. I have found a herbal remedy called Valerian which is really good, I take a couple before bed and have ended up having a great solid sleep and wake up about half an hour before I get up. The vivid dreams seem to have lessened as well, which is a great side effect! Commenter Ms Patonga Location Land of Nod Date and time April 17, 2012, 11:21AM Valerian is great!<query> what is the best herbal remedy for vivid dreams</query> I find it calms me down and helps quieten my mind so falling asleep is easier. Commenter aro Location Date and time April 17, 2012, 11:54AM I'd add to that pure lavander oil: a few drops on wrists and neck. Very, very good for mild insomnia! Commenter Donna Joy Location Date and time April 17, 2012, 12:08PM You are my sleep twin. I often wake between 3am and 4am and find it hard to drop off. Some nights I'd give almost anything to turn off the dreams for a while as mine are frequent, vivid and often of the being trapped or falling variety. Xanax reduces the dreams but makes me drowsy and short-tempered the following day, and Polaramine sometimes brings on vivid but not always unpleasant dreams.<query> what is the best thing to take for sleep</query> I'll try Valerian -- thank you. Commenter Secret Squirrel Location Melbourne Date and time April 17, 2012, 2:30PM I hear you Secret Squirrel! My dreams are often of the ""going nowhwere"" variety, involving exhausting amounts of missed trains, forgetting where I parked the car, on the wrong bus etc - which I see as being trapped in the one place. Not to mention the recurring ""haunted house"" dream which I've had for years, so much so that it is getting more annoying rather than scary. My uncle once told me to try the exercise whereby before falling asleep, you tell yourself ""I am only going to dream of (insert something pleasant) tonight."" It can work, but I tend to nod off before i remember to do so! I do recommend the Valerian as mentioned - I think because it relaxes you, the dreams tend to lose their intensity.<query> what to do when you dream of something pleasant tonight</query> Good luck and sweet dreams! Commenter Ms Patonga Location Date and time April 17, 2012, 3:19PM ........ and yet Valerian keeps me awake even more so. go figure. Commenter OKFJ Location down by the bay Date and time April 18, 2012, 10:03AM I need to take Valerian at least 3 hours before going to bed. Even if it soemtimes does not help me sleep, it does help with the waking as it takes away the feeling of grogginess you get with no sleep.

Let us count the ways: firstly we are over-caffeinated, we are over-wired and we're overworked. Being over-caffeinated (coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks, snacks) and over-medicated (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, including alcohol), is wreaking havoc with slumber patterns. Then being over-wired (video games, web browsing, social media, texting) and overstressed (money, work, relationships, overloaded schedules), is making us too restless to doze off when we should. Plus we're overworked (longer hours, night shifts incompatible with our biological clocks) and overweight (perhaps a chicken-or-egg deal, as different studies have found that one leads to the other).<query> why do we sleep so much</query> And then there's societal pressure, what US sleep expert Dr Mark Mahowald calls ""the pervasive, erroneous attitude that sleep is not a biological imperative, that it is negotiable. We have raised sleep deprivation to a badge of honour."" Mahowald is director of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center, chief of the Department of Neurology at Hennepin County Medical Center and professor of neurology at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The effects might outnumber the causes, and are hardly as benign as many of us might think. ""Any degree of sleep deprivation will impair performance: behind the wheel, in the classroom or workplace,"" Mahowald said. The lowdown: - Insomnia victims have trouble falling or staying asleep in a setting with adequate conditions for sleep; this becomes chronic insomnia if it lasts more than three weeks.<query> what is the effect of sleep deprivation</query> Sleep deprivation is caused by behavioural or situational factors that curtail or mitigate the ability to get enough sleep time. - Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a night. The amount a person needs is genetically determined, Mahowald said. ""Some people might need four hours on the short end, up to 10 on the high end. We have absolutely no control over this."" - Anyone who uses an alarm clock ""is by definition sleep-deprived,"" Mahowald said, ""because if the brain had received the amount of sleep it wanted, you would have woken up before the alarm went off."" - Larks and owls: ""Some people are early to bed, early to rise; others late to bed, late to rise. We have very little control over that,"" Mahowald said. ""So you see a lot of problems when an owl marries a lark and each one thinks the other is being stubborn."" - With sleep deprivation, some glucose metabolism problems might predispose one to diabetes.<query> what is sleep deprivation</query> And if so, a consequence could be heart disease and stroke. - With insomnia, there is no evidence of long-term physical problems or links to other diseases. But insomnia results in poorer quality of life and work absences and can lead to depression. - There is some evidence that severe sleep apnea can lead to hypertension, heart problems and a higher risk of strokes. At different stages of our lives, we're plagued by unique stresses. The good snoozing news: Solutions that go well beyond counting sheep are at hand. Late teens - Common stress sources: schoolwork and social pressures. - This is the stage of circadian rhythm shifts: The ability to fall asleep shifts to later in the night just as the need for sleep increases. This age group has a hard time getting out of bed early and an even harder time attending early-morning classes.<query> what is the cause of sleep apnea</query> That leads to poor attention, concentration and irritability. - Technology's bite: Young people who are on Facebook or video games late into the night have trouble winding down for bed. - Caffeine is a huge factor, not only in beverages and ""nutritional supplements"" but everything from sweets to potato chips, and now inhaled caffeine. - Obstructive sleep apnea is on the rise among teens, and might be related to the rise in teen obesity. 40-ish - Common stress sources: work, finances, parenthood. - Increased work and family obligations abound: Think 5am swimming practices, more early-morning and late-evening meetings at work. - As many of us age, our biological clocks shift so that we go to sleep earlier and get up earlier. Sleep needs don't change, although sleep might be lighter and more fragmented.<query> what is the cause of sleep apnea</query> - Many people in this age range who suffer from insomnia are reluctant to seek treatment because they want to avoid sleeping medications. People are increasingly turning to over-the-counter nonprescription agents that have some effect. - In middle years the risk for intrinsic sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, increases. Restless-limb syndrome often starts. 70-ish - Common stress sources: health-related issues and finances. - Contrary to previous conventional wisdom, aging does not cause poor sleep. It appears that most people experiencing sleep deterioration have another underlying medical cause. - Pain is an issue for this group. Partly as a result, there's heightened concern with those 70 or older taking a lot of medication. - Good news, of a sort: We used to see insomnia related to retirement in this age group, but more people are continuing to work later in life.<query> what age group is most affected by sleep apnea</query> SOLUTIONS - Improving sleep hygiene - avoiding late eating and drinking, keeping the room cool and dark, winding down before bedtime - can improve or resolve transient or acute insomnia but probably not chronic insomnia. - For chronic insomnia, cognitive behavioural therapy is equally as or more effective than medications. Medication often is useful for acute insomnia. - Naps can help - except when they don't. ""We discourage napping when anyone has problems falling or staying asleep at night, which might be an untreated sleep disorder,"" said Dr Michael Schmitz, who runs the Behavioural Sleep Medicine Program at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. ""We encourage power naps, 30 minutes or less, when people can't stay awake or will have late-night events."" - See your doctor if: You have had difficulty falling and staying asleep for more than a week.<query> can napping help insomnia</query> Or if you snore, have frequent awakenings and are reporting sleepiness during the day. Anyone with apnea symptoms should seek treatment. SHNS 41 comments I can sleep 9 hrs a night no problem, yet I also have a very busy job, do shift work, have lots of financial goals, 3 young kids, drink lots of caffeine in the daytime and moderate alcohol. So it CAN be done ! Here's a tip : do NOT use the bedroom for anything other than sleep ( or sex ! ). That way, you become wired to going to sleep when you go to bed. People who do work in the bedroom or watch TV or whatever are making a potential big mistake. We refuse to have a TV in the bedroom. Commenter C Location Date and time April 17, 2012, 10:21AM I feel you should definitely start thinking about opening a practice to help insomniacs - your motto being ""if i can do it anyone can"".<query> can you sleep 9 hours a night</query>"

Published On :26 July,2010 If you will talk about developing a website with anyone, apart from gathering information about the type of website you need, an important (mandatory) question will come – “do you have any preference for the technology to be used for deploying this website?” Most of the time answer is a question back “What do you suggest?”, reason being clients are not tech savvy so they really do not understand this question.<query> what platform is linux</query> And it’s logical too, if I am associated with implementing the technology I can better understand this question and directly say .NET or PHP as the answer, but if I am a cloth merchant looking for a website this question will sound like Greek to me. Now here the service provider takes the advantage that they suggest the technology in which they expertise, rather it should be decided depending upon the nature of the application to be deployed, scope of the future enhancements and to an extent the budget the client has allotted for the same. While talking about deploying web based applications Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms. Now depending upon the platform of the server on which the site is to be hosted defines the options of the scripting languages and the database servers that can be used for developing the application. If we talk about Linux as the platform the most commonly used scripting languages includes – PHP, CGI, Perl, Python etc.<query> what is the most popular scripting language</query> For Windows platform the scripting languages used are ASP, ASP.NET, C#, Cold Fusion etc. For the database servers Linux offers support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase etc and MS SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle are the database servers of choice for Windows platform. Its not mandatory that these are the categorizations for the scripting languages and database servers for the said platforms, the scripting languages for Linux also come for as Windows binary and visa versa. Though there are certain differences among these two as listed below, but both of them are platforms of choice for deploying functionality rich web based applications: - - Linux is an open source freeware whereas Windows is a Microsoft brand. - Additional components for Linux are generally free whereas the components for Windows need to be purchased. - Linux is considered to be more virus proof then Windows - Web space for Linux being freeware is less costly then Windows - The cost of Linux web space includes the cost for database server whereas for windows if MS SQL server is opted it costs additional.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux</query> For the purposes of listing factors to choose which platform, we can say: - - The budget the client has for hosting. - If the specific requirement requires a specific component then identifying weather it is available with Windows or Linux - If the size of database is going to be huge MS SQL sever is preferred because of the additional features it offers for the data management. - Both Linux and Windows are equally reliable and robust, but yes on Windows special software are required for providing safety from hackers and non-authentic access. - Is the client specific about brand then Windows is the only choice. Thus to conclude, both these platform are platforms of choice for deploying feature rich websites and offer flexibilities of deploying interactive and data rich websites.

clueweb12-0814wb-35-04451,21,2,"Windows or Linux web hosting platform? Hosting Blog Hosting Articles Hosting Guide Tutorials Sunday March 11, 2012 Top Web Hosting Shared Web Hosting VPS Hosting Dedicated Hosting Reseller Hosting Windows or Linux web hosting platform? When it comes to choosing a platform or operating system, the choice that most people will face is between Linux/UNIX and Windows. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, its followers and its detractors. In this article, we'll list some of the main benefits of each platform, to help you make the choice that's right for you. Tips on how to choose between windows and linux hosting 1. Linux has a reputation for being more reliable than Windows. However, the new generation of Windows platforms (NT4.0 onwards) are generally considered to be nearly as reliable as UNIX. Reliability is probably only an issue if you're a developer. For the average user, there's nothing to choose between the two systems.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux hosting</query> 2. Similarly, there is nothing to choose between Windows and Linux when it comes to performance. Both perform hosting and operating functions to the same standard. 3. Professional web developers tend to prefer UNIX in terms of accessibility. Again, for the average user, both systems are equally user friendly, with simple to use control panels and interfaces. 4. UNIX is open source, and therefore more flexible than Windows, which is a commercial, proprietary product. UNIX can work across any number of operating systems, whereas Windows is pretty much confined to its own products. 5. UNIX also has a reputation for greater stability than Windows. This might be a decisive factor if you're a professional developer, or if your work requires a stable environment generally. 6. Linux is the gamer's platform of choice, since it allows the game to run smoothly and reliably. It can even be used to run games that have been created for Windows (although the reverse isn't necessarily the case). Many commercial games, such as Playstation 3, come with Linux ready installed. 7. Windows is a commercial product, and as such, it needs to take account of its customers' opinions and requirements. The support you get from Windows is generally considered to be better and faster.<query> what is the difference between windows and unix</query> 8. Perhaps the final deciding factor is that of cost. Linux is open source, and therefore free. It's always going to be cheaper than Windows, which, when all is said and done, is there to make money for Microsoft. In the end, the difference between Linux and Windows is very small. Unless you're a heavy user or a professional, you're unlikely to notice it. Your choice may well come down to personal taste, rather than technical considerations. Try both, and see which one feels right for you.

clueweb12-0202wb-94-15779,23,2,"Diabetes Searches with Google Advanced Search Diabetes Searches with Google By David Mendosa Most of us use the Web search engine called Google. In a few short years it has replacedYahoo! , AltaVista, and a myriad of other sites as the search engine responsible for more traffic to Web sites than any other, according to a recentrating. Google is intelligent. If you use Google, you might assume that you don't need to read this column. But if you don't learn anything here about how to make better use of it, I will buy you a free subscription. Actually, Google is totally free anyway. If I could, I would put my money where my word processor is. I use Google exclusively in searching for information for my articles on the Web, as well as checking out my non-professional interests there.<query> what search engine is used for diabetes</query> It has everything that a search engine needs, and a lot more. The key ingredients are size, speed, and relevance. With more than 3 billion Web pages, no other search engine comes close. When I searched for ""diabetes,"" it reported in 0.17 seconds that there were about 3,100,000 pages that mentioned that term and displayed links in context to the 100 most relevant pages. Google is intelligent. What sets it apart the most from other search engines is its PageRank software, which founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed when they were students at Stanford University. PageRank uses the Web's link structure as an indicator of an individual page's value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B. But Google also analyzes the page that casts the vote.<query> what is google's search engine</query> Votes cast by pages that themselves get a lot of votes help the pages they are linked to get more votes. Then, Google combines PageRank with sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. This means the first pages that Google returns are usually the best ones on that subject. Google has many special features. It groups different pages at the same site together. One feature that I use all the time are ""cached"" links, which is what the page looked like when Google found it by crawling the Web. If the page is unavailable when I find it through a Google search, I click on ""Cache"" to see the page as it looked when Google found it. If you know the Web site you want to search, but don't know where the information is located within that site, you can use Google to search only that domain.<query> what is google cache</query> You do this by entering what you're looking for followed by the word ""site"" and a colon followed by the domain name. For example, if you wanted to know what this site has to say about the all-important A1c test, you would enter this: A1c site:diabetes.org When I did that as I prepared this column, it instantly returned 124 pages, listing my most recent column about ""A1C<7"" here first. I especially like Google's way with words. It's smart enough to guess the correct spelling of a search term. This morning, I searched for the fund where a friend of mine works. I spelled it ""semperverens,"" the spelling used on just three sites. So it asked me, ""Did you mean: sempervirens,"" because that term shows up more than 55,000 times, and the Sempervirens Fund that I was looking for was the first link it returned when I accepted Google's spelling suggestion.<query> how to spell a1c</query> You can also use Google to find the most common spelling or punctuation of a word. For example, ""e-mail"" shows up 9,980,000 times, a slight preference over ""email"" at 9,940,000. It's a dictionary too. By clicking on the top entry for the word searched, you will bring up many dictionaries with their definitions. All this is just in Google's main search engine. But it also has several special search sites. What if you want to find what the government has to say about diabetes? There are hundreds, if not thousands, of government sites. But Google searches them all for you if you use<Unclesam>. Google also has replaced DejaNews.com as the site where you can search newsgroups. It stores the entire archive of Usenet discussion groups dating back to 1981, more than 700 million posts.<query> what is google search for</query> It includes 232,000 in misc.health.diabetes, 139,000 in alt.support.diabetes, 10,100 in alt.support.diabetes.uk, and 6,560 in alt.support.diabetes.kids. The newest part of Google lets you search the news. Still in beta, Google News lets you search 4,000 news sites within minutes of the news going up. I search almost daily for stories that mentiondiabetes . There are so many articles that it can be almost overwhelming. There's lots more including a Web directory like Yahoo! uses and about 400 million images. Another tool provides a rough translation from English to five other languages and visa versa. Finally, if you install the Google toolbar, you can speed up your searches even more. Does it sound like I own stock in Google? I'm certainly pushing it, but I am sorry to say that I don't own any of it. Google is privately held, and I'm not a holder. The American Diabetes Association originally published this article on its Web site as one of my “About the Internet” columns.<query> what is google news</query> Last modified: December 16, 2002 Go back to David Mendosa's Home Page Go back to David Mendosa's Diabetes Directory I comply with the HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.

However even the signal meters on the most expensive radios are not particularly accurate or properly calibrated. As such ""S"" meters should only be used to provide a visual representation ofrelative signal strengths and notactual strengths! Signal meters are handy for making comparisons between different CB operators that are being received and especially useful for antenna experiments: Using the ""S"" meter for checking the received signal strength of a new antenna or antenna location with an older antenna or location is very useful for optimising your antenna system. Most modern CB's have a signal meter in the form of an LED bar-graph (like a mobile phone) but others have the more traditional 'swinging needle' analogue meter that many CB operators and radio users prefer since it looks like rigs of old and can show infinite movements in signal strength rather than jumping from LCD block to LCD block.<query> what is a signal meter</query> Signal meters have scales marked S1 - S9. S1 being the weakest signal and S9 being strong signals. On high grade amateur radio equipment it is widely (though not universally accepted!) that the ""S9"" point represents a received signal of 50µV (microvolts), although some equipment, such as transceivers manufactured by Ranger, specify that the S9 point should be calibrated at 100µV. It is usually accepted that each ""S"" point below S9 this represents a gradation of 6dB (decibels), though this is a contentious statement as some would argue that gradations of 5 dB or 4 dB might be more typical in 'real' S meters. You can see how ""S"" meters cannot be wholly relied upon for laboratory standard accuracy! There are additional markings above ""S9"", usually marked +30 on CB radios, which means a voltage of 30 decibels above 50 microvolts which is 1580 microvolts. Many S meters also double as a very rudimentary power meter to provide an indication of the power output when transmitting (TX) - this will be indicated on the meter's face in units of Watts - again this may or may not be particularly accurate!<query> what is the s9 point on a radio</query> Below is a table that shows what the actual received voltage would be on a perfectly calibrated Signal Meter using the often accepted 6 dB per ""S"" unit calibration and comparing this with the 5dB and 4dB per ""S"" unit calibration.

As a very rough rule of thumb the receiver section of many CB radios require about 0.5 uV (microvolts) of RF input to produce a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of around 20 dB. + 6dB = 4 x the power or 2 x the voltage or approximately1 ""S"" point +10dB = 10 x the power or 3.16 x the voltage or approximately 1.5 ""S"" points +20dB = 100 x the power or10 x the voltage or approximately 6 ""S"" points See more detail about Decibels below: Throwing A Cat Amongst The Pigeons Ranger Communications inc. set a specification in their service manuals that an input voltage of 100 microvolts should produce a reading of S9 on the signal meter.<query> what is the voltage of a cb radio</query> If this is to be the accepted norm then the resulting 'S' readings would be as follows: ""S"" Meters calibrated to Ranger Communications spec's ""S"" Reading Received voltage using 6 dB ""S"" point spacing S1 0.4 uV S2 0.8 uV S3 1.6 uV S4 3.2 uV S5 6.2 uV S6 12.5 uV S7 25 uV S8 50 uV S9 100 uV S9 +10 316 uV S9 +20 1000 uV S9 +30 3160 uV ^ Back to the index at the top of this page PHONETIC ALPHABET The phonetic alphabet is always very useful for making yourself understood when signals are weak.

A decibel is actually one tenth of a Bel and is derived from the logarithmic ratio of two voltages or current or power levels: One of these levelsmust be measured to act as the reference point in order that the other level (or levels) can be expressed as dB relative to that point. So; Decibels (dBs) represent a RATIO of one voltage to another, or one power to another at the same impedance. Decibels can be either a positive figure representing gain or a negative figure representing a loss. Here is a table of decibel relationships: Voltage Loss Power Loss dB Voltage Gain Power Gain 1.000 1.000 0 1.000 1.000 0.981 0.977 0.1 1.012 1.023 0.977 0.955 0.2 1.023 1.047 0.966 0.933 0.3 1.035 1.072 0.955 0.912 0.4 1.047 1.096 0.944 0.891 0.5 1.059 1.122 0.933 0.871 0.6 1.072 1.148 0.912 0.832 0.8 1.096 1.202 0.891 0.794 1.0 1.122 1.259 1 0.794 0.631 2.0 1.259 1.585 0.708 0.501 3.0 1.413 1.995 0.631 0.398 4.0 1.585 2.512 0.562 0.316 5.0 1.778 3.162 0.501 0.251 6.0 1.995 3.981 0.447 0.200 7.0 2.239 5.012 0.398 0.159 8.0 2.512 6.310 0.355 0.126 9.0 2.818 7.943 0.316 0.100 10.0 3.162 10 1 0.200 0.0398 14.0 5.01 25.1 0.100 0.0100 20.0 10 100 dBs can be added to represent the total gain or the total loss, while the gain or losses that are expressed as fractions must be multiplied.<query> what is the decibel</query> These days only channel 19 seems to be used as a calling channel. This is done by keying the mic' and saying ""One nine for a roger?"", ""One nine a roger"", ""One nine for a copy?"" or even ""Hello, is anyone on channel?"". CB etiquette dictates that once you have found another breaker to talk to you move to another clear channel to continue the conversation. However it seems that far to many breakers ignore this etiquette and rudely stay on the 19 chatting away and thereby preventing anybody else putting a call out on the channel. When you use the 19 to make a call and find another breaker to talk to, be polite and ""Pick another window"" i.e.promptly move away to a different channel to continue your conversation there! A conversation on the CB is often called a ""QSO"".<query> what is the cb etiquette</query> e.g. a power gain of 2.5 dB is dealt with thus: 2.0 dB plus 0.5 dB i.e. 1.585 X 1.122 = 1.778 When thinking about our CB signals here are some quick examples: + 3dB = 2 xthe power or 1.4 x the voltage + 6dB = 4 x the power or2 x the voltage or approximately 1 ""S"" point +10dB = 10 x the power or 3.16 x the voltage or approximately 1.5 ""S"" points +20dB = 100 x the power or 10 x the voltage or approximately 6 ""S"" points Transmitter Power Transmitter power is usually simply expressed in Watts, however it is also quite common to come encounter a transmitter power expressed in dBW. This is the power in decibels relative to one Watt. For example if a transmitter is quoted as having an output of 6dBW then that would be the same as saying that the power is 4 watts.<query> what is the power of a transmitter</query> If a transmitter is quoted as having a power of 14 dBW just multiply the 10dBW figure (i.e. 10 watts) by the 4dBW figure (i.e. 2.5 watts): 10W x 2.5 = 25 Watts. Here is a table showing the conversion between dBW and Watts: dBW Power in Watts dBW Power in Watts 0 1 16 40 1 1.25 17 50 2 1.6 18 63 3 2.0 19 79 4 2.5 20 100 5 3.2 21 126 6 4 22 158 7 5 23 200 8 6.3 24 251 9 8 25 316 10 10 26 398 11 13 27 501 12 16 28 631 13 20 29 794 14 25 30 1,000 15 32 40 10,000 ^ Back to the index at the top of this page PLEASURES & PITFALLS CB is great: The Citizens Band can be especially useful for clubs, drivers, truckers and other groups of people to keep in touch.<query> convert watts to dbw</query> A good but basic CB installation is very inexpensive to establish. CB radio can also be great fun and entertaining when just used for chatting and tittle-tattle! CB is easy to use and there is a wide range of excellent equipment available. Radio and CB radio is a fascinating hobby - there is much fun and enjoyment to be had while experimenting with antennas, radios and other accessories. Under certain atmospheric conditions, especially at the height of the solar cycle when sun-spot numbers are high, it is possible to make contacts over great distances. Distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles can be possible! But: Don't give out your address over the air. Don't give out your telephone number over the air. Don't give out personal details over the air.<query> what is cb radio</query> WALLIES: Most areas of the country have one or two ""Wallies"" - people who try to disrupt conversations or block channels with a 'dead key' (a silent, un-modulated carrier), by playing music or by making silly noises. These idiots are in a minority, but as with society in general there is always a moron somewhere who just likes to be annoying. (It's the - stupid little brain-dead bully who likes to steal your football - syndrome.) The ONLY way to deal with these cretins is to IGNORE them! NEVER respond in any way. Never try to argue with them. Responding to idiots like this will only encourage them. Either move to another channel, or switch the radio off for a while. ^ Back to the index at the top of this page FREEBANDING AND SSB See the FREEBANDING page Here ><query> what is the name of the person who plays music on the radio</query> Who uses CB radio? e.g. 1: You may have a convoy of cars going on a group holiday or regular outings and CB allows you to keep in easier contact than mobile phones since everyone can hear each message. This applies to 4x4 clubs, caravan clubs, motorhome or caravanning clubs etc. e.g. 2: You may be involved in a business activity that would benefit from a group of colleagues being able to talk to each other as a group easily and freely, something mobile phone calls cannot do. The best example of this is truckers who can talk to their colleagues or just have a friendly ratchet with any other truckers in the locality - or any other breakers in the area. e.g. 3: You may be a farmer, in which case a CB radio is an ideal way to keep in touch with the farm vehicles from a base CB radio installed in the farm offices or farmhouse.<query> what is cb radio</query> e.g. 4: You may have a group of friends in your locality who just want to keep in touch using radio or you all have a mutual interest in radio as a hobby and CB is a great way to foster that interest and have a good time on the airwaves at the same time. You establish your own little 'net' and may talk to each other at regular times and often on a favourite channel. e.g. 5: You may have an interest in DXing, that is to contact other CB operators in far flung parts of this country, Europe or the world. This is fun and exciting and is dependent upon the 11 year 'sunspot cycle'. Such long distance DXing (""Skip"") is best when the sunspot cycle is at its maximum - currently we have fairly low sunspot numbers so it's not so good.<query> what is cb</query> This activity benefits from a bigger twig like a 1/2 wave or 5/8th wave silver rod or Sirio 827 or A99 etc.) An off-shoot from this part of the hobby is ""Freebanding"" where users use out of band frequencies to make contacts using SSB (single side band) rather than the more usual FM. See more about Freebanding here > e.g. 6: You may have a canal boat, river cruiser or marine vessel and CB is an ideal way of keeping in touch with other members of the community. Antennas specifically designed for the rigours of such a damp environment are available from manufacturers such as Sirio. Those are just some examples.

If the other CBers can hear you and *want* to bring you in, they will do so.

If your transmitted audio is too high it will cause 'over-deviation' of the signal causing distortion which will make it difficult for other to understand what you are saying. This control allows you to make adjustments. Memories: Some radios have several memories to store often used channels. Channel Scan: Can be set to continually scan through all the channels until a transmission is found. LCR: Last Channel Recall is used to return to the last channel transmitted on.<query> what is the cb control</query> PA: Allows a ""Public Address"" function to be used through an external loudspeaker. Key Lock: Allows keypad buttons to be locked so that channels cannot accidentally be changed. Quick Up Down Buttons: Jumps 10 channels up or down at a time. Channel Change: A rotary knob or up down buttons select channels 1 to 40 Squelch: A noise gate that cuts out the hiss & noise present when there is no signal. Adjustable for varying signal strengths - to receive weaker signals it needs to be set as low as possible, at the point when the noise and hiss just stops. RF Gain: This control adjusts the amount of amplification in the receiver (RX) circuits. Normally set at maximum for best sensitivity, but can be reduced to prevent close by transmissions causing receiver overloading (noise and splatter).<query> what is the rf gain on a loudspeaker</query> Dual Watch (DW): Used to monitor two channels simultaneously. Noise Limiter/Reduction: Can help reduce noise or increase intelligibility of weak signals - with varying degrees off success. Frequency Display: Allows display to show the transmitted frequency in addition to, or instead of the channel number. Mic Channel Change Buttons: Channel change buttons located on microphone for convenient channel changes. ^ Back to the index at the top of this page HOW TO GIVE MEANINGFUL SIGNAL REPORTS: Often when you are asked how good somebody's signal is, it is good enough to say that ""You're shaking the windows"" or ""Blowing the doors off"" or ""Plus thirty here"" when the signals are extremely strong or report ""Thin"" or ""Weak"" when the signals are poor. If another breaker requests a ""Radio Check"" or ""Rig Check"" it would be better to provide a more accurate report.<query> what is the purpose of the mic channel switch</query> This is when the amateur radio operator's RST signal reporting method is a better choice. RST is: R: Readability - A rating of how well what is being said is understood. The readability of a signal is given on a scale of1 to 5; ""5"" being perfectly understandable with no difficulty - reported as ""Radio 5"". A rating of 1 means that the signal is completely un-readable. S: Signal Strength - A rating of how strong a received signal is. The ""S"" rating is given on a scale of1 to 9. A rating of ""Signal 1"" indicates an extremely faint signal while a rating of ""Signal 9"" is an extremely strong signal. T: Tone - This is only used for Morse Code, so does not apply to CB radio.<query> what is rst rating</query> The ""T"" rating would be used to give an indication of the tonal quality of the Morse Code signals. T1 would indicated an extremely rough tone and T9 a pure tone. (Used in Amateur Radio, but not relevant to CB radio!) Being as it is only the R and T parts of the RST code that are applicable to CB radio, you may hear reports being given such as ""You're Five and Nine"" which means perfectly understandable with extremely strong signals. A report of ""4 and 5"" would mean quite easy to understand with fairly good signal strength. Even having explained all this, there are some CB operators will give everyone a ""5 and 9"" report, even if the signal being received is weak and difficult to understand! - I don't know why this is.<query> what is the rst code for cb radio</query>"

My first choice was Microsoft Access, because it's easy to use and easy to implement with visual basic. But I've been searching, and it seems that Access can't deal with multiple accesses at the same time on the same database. Since MSDE is free, and it's based on SQL, I think it's the best choice, since it's integration with VB seems easy. What do you think? And which database is faster? Access or MSDE.

All they need is heart of gold and a dream. I truly hate what college admissions has become. I hate that a list comes out every couple of weeks (and gets increasingly ridiculous). I hate that only a handful of colleges are mentioned over and over and over again, while others apparently don't exist. And I hate that admissions counselors have nothing to offer but bull -- wrapped in bacon though it may be, but it's still bull. Let's see a list of schools that talk about the highest STD rates, the most crime, the biggest waitlist boondoggle, the most admissions cronyism, the most professors/staff/coaches who have been arrested for sexual offenses, or maybe even a list of who has the most hidden expenses.<query> what is the most std-prone school</query> Where are those lists, Princeton Review?

However, my two sons were accepted by Harvard and Stanford and graduated from those esteemed universities. (It's interesting that my SAT scores were pathetically low while my own biological children had almost perfect scores. How could they have been so much smarter than their own mother?)

There was a New York Times article that outlined the very thing you're talking about now. Children with upper middle class or wealthy parents do much better on standardized tests like the SAT and ACT and are more likely to graduate from college. This has little to to with intelligence and more to do with access to good schools and being in a family culture that values education and steeps its children in a more educationally rich environment. This, unfortunately, does not and, to some extent, cannot happen in poor families where the parents didn't have the experience of going to college or whose children don't have access to good schools.<query> what is the most selective college in the us</query> http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/the-reproduction-of-privilege/ lakefront_liberal: You're right about that.

My father went to college, but my mother did not, and my brother and I got a huge huge push for the best schools we could get access to from a very young age. My parents sacrificed a lot to the point where we had moved just to be within a district that provided highly gifted magnet public education, where both my brother and I did our 1st through 12 grades.<query> which college is the most selective</query> We both went to UC Berkeley and while he went to NYU law (got accepted to and full scholarships for NYU, Harvard, and UM Law), while I went on to get my Masters. My parents weren't necessarily rich, but they valued education enough to make all the sacrifices necessary to provide for my brother and myself. Then again, I had a tiger mother, I didn't even know college wasn't mandatory until my freshman year of high school. wazza: Parents (obviously) play a huge huge role in providing access http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/wazza/most-selective-colleges-in-america_n_1346444_141451855.html History | Permalink | Share it This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

To that end, we asked the Princeton Review to shares its list of the 16 colleges in its flagship book,The Best 376 Colleges (published August 2011) that earned a 99 -– the highest possible score -- on the Company's unique ""Admissions Selectivity Rating."" Presented in alphabetical order, this list is based on the Princeton Review's analysis of data it exclusively gathers from its institutional and student surveys. We also asked the Princeton Review's Senior VP/Publisher, Rob Franek, to offer his expert advice on how to gain acceptance into these outstanding schools.

It seems to me that the goal should be to maximize the rank:selectivity ratio. For example, Yale is not on this list, but it is typically ranked in the top 3, so maybe students should focus their efforts on Yale since they have a better shot of getting in, and it still ranks above nearly every other school.<query> most selective colleges in us</query> BeyJoshua: Interesting article/videos, but I can't help thinking that it's one http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/BeyJoshua/most-selective-colleges-in-america_n_1346444_141405239.html History | Permalink | Share it DessLoch ""Gamilon Power!"" 294 Fans 5 hours ago (12:51 PM) ?

The really top institutions cannot be bought that way; for example Harvard's endowment is valued at $32 billion. It does help to have a parent who went to that college, especially if they are either unusually successful or consistently active in the alumni association. For everyone else the matter is straightforward: make certain there is no weak spot in your application (grades all B and above, etc.) and have something in your favor that 10,000 valedictorians don't have. A state championship in something usually does it. There are many other possibilities; pursue an interest with enough seriousness and depth to produce results.

College applications are kind of an exercise in BS-ology. You have to groom this phony image of being well-rounded, interested in everything, nice enough to volunteer for ""good"" causes, etc. It's all BS. Fortunately, once you get to grad school, at least in science and engineering, all that fluff becomes irrelevant. In some European countries, the way you make it into the most prestigious universities is by taking an entrance exam. Everyone gets a grade and a rank based on it (no names show).

FaceBook Twitter Email Share 27 Comments RSS 0 Like comment by Dave 486 days ago The US bishops seem to have been happy with the idea of a US universal health care system. I would think, not so much to extend coverage, which is clearly fairly good, but to make doing so less expensive, or probably more accurately justly sharing the burden. The more the US bishops and their associated hospitals can collect in excess money, the more we extend health coverage to other countries, just as we do now. It would be nice if they could set up medical schools in Africa, for instance, this would be a just remittance for their offering so many quality physicians to the US.<query> why is universal health care good</query> I personally, do not the the Federal government as the best venue (subsidiarity) for where to make this decision, but many states are demoralized and seem to rely on the fed for everything, rather than figuring their own stuff out. One thing to remember about the US health care system is that the rapidly rising health care costs are destabilizing the economy to some extent, but this seems to be based in the mass collection of wealth by the top 1%. Sad, but true, while my conservative use of government nature indicates that messing unnecessarily is bad, something about the current pay scale seems incredibly bad for mankind, really, the whole world is now subject to our ruling class. What exactly is basic health care is complicated in wealthy countries (which hip replacement? Which prosthesis?), but much less so in poorer countries.<query> why is the health care system bad</query> It is not that the US doesn't have hard decisions to make. What do we do? We have to leave stuff to the professionals, as the bishops would prefer, but we can't ignore death in the current plan, otherwise, aside from lying about it nature in other ways, it might be just fine. It's obviously true that increasing basic stuff in the West like cancer screenings (mammograms) are going to raise overall costs. If the US people got raising in line with company and economic growth in the country, it is unlikely that the increases in medical costs would be problem. People have the obligation to use the government for some things, level dependent on specific needs (venue size).

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world.<query> what is the benefit of telecommunications technology</query> As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.

The educational structure in most traditional public schools can provide the students with a better, and give them wider opportunities to practice, and to interact with the real world/target audience. 20 days ago Mark Mark W. • @Fernando What did you mean to say, ""The educational structure in most traditional public schools can provide the students with a better ..."" what? You didn't complete your thought. I don't see traditional structure being particularly good at providing opportunities for practice or interaction within their temporal and spatial limitations. Also there is a great difference between the terms ""real world"" and and ""target audience."" Can you clarify what you meant? BTW, a college President I recently served had no understanding of a target audience which I found shocking.<query> what is the educational structure in most traditional public schools</query> 20 days ago Fernando Fernando P. • I see now, Mark. I am sorry for this. .By structure in a virtual classroom, my thought for that is, the student is left on his own to learn on something that he wants to learn. the student is left to learn by himself, and he is responsible for his own learning. On the other hand, in a traditional public school structure, normally, there is a presence of a teacher who serves and acts as facilitator of learning. The teacher sees to it that the student is given clear cut directions and precise instructions on what to do with a particular task or lesson or activity. Also, the warmth that the teacher-facilitator exudes in a public school structure is sensed, felt, and is being experienced by the student, whereas in a virtual world or classroom such may seems to me NIL.<query> what is the difference between a virtual classroom and a virtual classroom</query> by ""Real World"" i mean to refer this term to a tangible, active, and more humane learning environment, where there is normal interaction going on, (either between the student and the teacher; student to student interaction, student with the interaction that is currently happening in the outside world, the interaction and practice with the learning materials that the students are presently using, or actively engaged in, etc..and free exchange of ideas. And by ""Target Audience"" I mean visible, and sometimes it could not be seen at all. 20 days ago Mark Mark W. • @Fernando No worries! We all make typos because our brains work faster than our hands. I understand better now. TY. Learning online takes more motivation because you don't have the physical environment associated with learning.<query> what is the real world of learning</query> Teaching online is a lot more work and it takes someone with special skills. Unfortunately many are coerced into it without proper training and preparation. They muddle through the best they can until they develop their online teaching skills. Now I'm speaking of courses designed to student/faculty interaction. There are some that are intended solely for independent learners and self-study. My advice is to take a good look at a course before jumping in. Talk to the instructor if you can. You might want to check out Black Hills State University's online offerings. They are doing quite a bit of virtual teaching there and so far I'm impressed with what they are doing. So impressed I'll be visiting them later this week. 20 days ago Fernando Fernando P. • Thank you very much, Mark.<query> what is the best online course to teach</query> And, I also would like to thank you for the kind advise that you have shared here in the Discussions in LinkedIn.

clueweb12-0100wb-75-27738,68,2,"Classrooms are obsolete (and so are teachers) — Bruce On Games Bruce On Games A veteran’s view on marketing games home archives about contact services ← Eight news stories 26.3 Eight news stories 3.7 → Classrooms are obsolete (and so are teachers) March 30th, 2009 | Crystal ball, Opinion Hello there! If you are new here, you might want tosubscribe to the RSS feed for updates on this topic. “Oh no” I can hear you say, an article about education. Boring. Yet it should be one of the most exciting things you can read about. It is the education industry and their heritage that have made it boring. And if it is boring for us then just imagine how boring it must be for the victims of our current system.<query> why are classrooms obsolete</query> What seems more apt is that what schools do the most is provide the kind of parenting and socialization that games cannot provide. Most learning is socially constructed, distributed, and mediated. Where will they play these games and who will be their mentors then? #4 Robin on 03.31.09 at 2:56 pm I agree with Brock’s point that there still needs to be a face-to-face social element to child development, which technology can assist but not replace. I don’t agree that traditional school systems fulfil this role very effectively at all. There are too many arbitrary, outdated rules governing social interaction, organisation and time management. The adult environment that schools most closely resemble is prison, which should be a cause for concern. #5 Deirdre on 03.31.09 at 9:38 pm I homeschooled my daughter using a lot of educational games and she learned to be independent and problem focused.<query> what is the role of the school system in child development</query> Traditional high school was a terrible step backward for her, even the social aspect frustrated her because of the avoidance of learning even among the “best” students. So as a teacher, it is difficult for me to argue that the present method of schooling should continue. #6 Stone Bytes on 04.04.09 at 10:58 pm One teacher for a group of around five students top is what I call real, efficient and social education. Considering the crap taught in schools and how the educational systems in many countries are being destroyed year after year, I would not be surprised to hear about a rise of such educational methods. That internet based learning system is not good enough. There needs to be a true human contact. #7 Marshal Anderson on 04.14.09 at 7:40 pm I guess the problem I have with this is that it sets out games as /the solution/ to education, but that it doesn’t actually say what it takes education to be.<query> why is social education necessary</query> I don’t think anyone would disagree that education in the west is currently floundering and lacking any kind of coherent approach, and I personally am not against the possibility that the only solution is to tear it all down and start again – but to suggest that the answer lies in a particular medium without any idea of what the message might be doesn’t really take us anywhere. It seems very much based on a behaviourist approach which assumes that some form of immediate reward reinforces learning. While there’s evidence this works in the learning of some skills and the memorisation of knowledge, there’s a whole bunch more stuff to education than long division and lists of kings and queens (or presidents). I’m really keen to see games technologies contribute to education, but for that to happen we need to avoid polarisation – the more I read about this issue the more I find it’s split between extremes of opinion like the above; give us ideas for how busy teachers today can benefit their students with this technology, within the constraints of society’s conflicting demands on education, so that we have more than a handful of gifted enthusiasts with projects that most schools simply can’t aspire to.<query> what is the role of games in education</query> Huggs :O) Marshal #8 Michael J on 10.27.09 at 12:15 pm Brilliant!

We are massive consumers of education. We start in formal education as toddlers and emerge in our 20s. Often none the wiser. And we learn far more out of school than we do in school. Then we have vocational training, usually continuously in our fast changing world. Plus our hobbies and interests that can often involve absorbing more knowledge than a degree course. Which all means that education is a massive industry. Far bigger than the recreational game industry is going to be for the foreseeable future. Which is very nice for us because gaming is perfectly suited to education. Far more so than the current classroom/teacher system. Our one on one, challenge-reward mechanism is the most perfect way yet of imparting knowledge.<query> what is the difference between education and gaming</query> I have watched our industry try to get into education for thirty years. And failing, continually. Because we try to do learning using games. We try and fit in with the old, inefficient teacher led systems. But we have had successes when we don’t try to fit in. Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training, for instance. And these successes come when there isn’t a teacher in sight, because they are true game based learning. And teachers and true game based education are incompatible. You cannot have them both at the same time. Teachers, at best, think that games are chocolate coated broccoli. A way of dressing up knowledge to make it palatable. They are wrong. Gaming is the optimum delivery system for giving the human mind knowledge. Because it is one on one interactive, because it creates exactly the right challenges at exactly the right time, because it can readily mix text with sound with pictures with videos, because it rewards the student properly at exactly the right time, because it is connected to the sum of all human knowledge, because it is non linear thus presenting knowledge in a more natural way, because it progresses the student at exactly the right pace and because it is connected to countless other people.<query> why is gaming an optimum delivery system</query> With proper game based learning it is very simple to keep a track of every student’s progress. But more than that it is very easy to see their strengths and weaknesses in all their complexity. The aptitudes of every single student will be plain to see. Which would lead to everyone having the optimum further education and making the right career choices for their abilities. Which would be a massive improvement on the current hit and miss methodology. So students wouldn’t just learn more, with better understanding and more quickly. They would also be learning the right things for them and for their life ahead. It isn’t just goodbye to classrooms and teachers. It is also goodbye to exams and school inspectors. Because any student’s knowledge and capabilities would be there to see in real time on the system. In fact exams are a very bad thing as they hold the majority of students back until everyone has mastered the syllabus to a given point.<query> why is game based learning important</query> With game based learning you are going to have a lot of people educated past degree level by the time they are 18. But the people who stand to gain most are those with “learning difficulties” who just cannot get all the attention they need with current learning methods. With game based learning they will have one on one learning that will push their aptitudes and capabilities to the limit resulting in much more fulfilling lives. So what are we going to do with all the teachers? Teach them to stack shelves in Tescos? Nope, there is something far more important for them to do and that is to prepare children for their futures in the real world. Not by teaching, but by mentoring. By guiding every single student, one on one, so each one can get the best out of our society and our society can get the best out of each student.<query> what is game based learning</query> Some educationalists who have a grasp of this seem to think that you still need a physical school. That each student has their own workstation. They call it “podularisation”. And they are wrong. All a student needs is a device connected to the interweb. A home computer,a netbook or even a smartphone . Yes, that’s right, smartphones replacing teachers. AndOnLive technology, or something similar, could be harnessed beautifully to deliver it all. The next thing that is going to shock is that much education will end up being free. Once it is all written and on a server the incremental cost for each extra student is zero. And as we have seen with so many things on the interweb there is an inevitable constant downwards price pressure till zero is reached. This will open up and democratise learning like never before.<query> what is the next step in education</query> It will be more influential than the invention of the printing press. Anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to consume whatever education they want any time they want, delivered to them in the optimum manner for them to absorb. This will massively advance the whole of humanity. I would like to thank Nolan Bushnell and all the other speakers at the Game Based Learning 2009 conference for stimulating my thoughts on this subject.

With this simple but explosive beginning, one of America’s most well respected professors of education looks seriously at the good that can come from playing video games. Gee is interested in the cognitive development that can occur when someone is trying to escape a maze, find a hidden treasure and, even, blasting away an enemy with a high powered rifle. Talking about his own video gaming experience learning and using games as diverse as Lara Croft and Arcanum, Gee looks at major specific cognitive activities: How individuals develop a sense of identity How one grasps meaning How one evaluates and follows a command How one picks a role model How one perceives the world This is a ground breaking book that takes up a new electronic method of education and shows the positive upside it has for learning.<query> who is paul gee</query> #2 Judy Valentine on 03.30.09 at 5:02 pm I’m not sure its the end of collective learning.

I have been studying games and learning and have found that most games, especially serious games have no valid or reliable system of measuring learning or transfer. Also, it seems fairly simplistic to assume that all kids like games, as I have found they do not; and more to the point, that all kids will like the same game.<query> what is the project called that uses mobile technology to teach</query>"

Higher color temperature lamps above 5500 K are ""cool"" (green–blue) colors, and lower color temperature lamps below 3000 K are ""warm"" (yellow–red) colors. Kelvins as applied to color temperature of lights/lamps are derived from the actual temperature of a black body radiator, which is the concept of color temperature based on the relationship between the temperature and radiation emitted by a theoretical standardized material and termed a ""black body radiator"". This is where the ""classic"" definition of Kelvin and that used for lights come together, as hypothetically, at cessation of all molecular motion (the black body state of this hypothetical radiator), the temperature is described as being at absolute zero or 0 Kelvin, which is equal to -273 degrees Celsius.<query> what is the kelvins of light</query> Here is a video comparison between 2nd generation LED (circa late 2009) and a more common 72 watt 10,000K light fixture: LED Comparison with Fluorescent light Back To Top Lunar (Moonlights) Often LED as noted above are used as lunar or moonlights. This is an area where anecdotal information seems to be the main information available. This includes the common belief that moonlight should be ""blue"" when in truth all the moon does is reflect diffused sunlight back to the earth (more during full moons, less during other phases). Dust or moisture can affect the color spectrum seen by the human eye as well (which often makes the light appear blue). This means that a dimmed/diffused daylight is a more accurate production of moonlight. This can be done by fading a Reef White AquaBeam LED as an example.<query> what makes moonlight blue</query> Essentially these are very popular for marine reef aquariums for both a low level ""night light"" and for simulating moonlight for corals and coral propagation. Where some of the misinformation comes into play is that many will state that fish need these lights, of which there absolutely no scientific proof and also that corals need these for proper growth which also has no scientific evidence to back this up. Aquarium Moon lights (lunar lights) do nothing to aid in this. What lunar lights (moonlights) could do with correct programming for the marine reef aquarium is to simulate marine lunar cycles which are necessary for some fish and coralreproduction/propagation, as Corals in the Great Barrier reef spawn 3-7 days following the first 2 Full moons in late spring and early summer. Even here there is still a lot of controversy as to what cycle is best and how much light is best.<query> what do moonlights do for corals</query> From what I personally have observed combined with the opinions of other aquarium professionals is the use of gray nylon filter placed over standard daylights (T2, T5, T8 CFL, etc.) can work as a moonlight; even low level ""white"" lights such as nightlight bulbs, or even theRio Mini Sun LED lights can work just fine for this since this has shown to be a more of a low level light issue and timing issue. Adding or subtracting the amount/intensity seems to be the secret of simulating these cycles which can be accomplish easily either manually or with electronic timers (that can be set to more accurate monthly 29.5 day lunar cycles of lighting). Strategically placing these lights also shows evidence as to properly simulating this effect. Please click on the picture above/left for a larger animated version of the lunar cycle If anyone reading this article has good scientific evidence to the contrary (or even to support) what I have just said about the use of lunar lights, please email me on my contact page with these references.<query> what kind of light do you use for a aquarium</query> Induction Lighting Although not a new technology per say, it is new in regards to commercial availability as until recently, new developments have broken down the barriers of costs and technological setbacks, such as EMC interference, lumen depreciation, ability to dim and a useful range of available wattages. This type of lighting last up to 100,000 hours (often over 20 plus years under normal usage) and is another good candidate to replace Metal Halide Lights. Induction lights do not have the warm up times of MH or similar (20 second warm up vs. 10 minute warm up), use no mercury, have no filaments to burn out, and they produce half the heat (160 F vs. 300 F for a 200 watt Induction Fixture vs. a comparable in output 400 watt MH fixture). Induction Lights generally have a high CRI of 82 with a high lumen per watt output (surpassing most MH).<query> what is the difference between a mh and an induction light</query> Currently the main negative as per Aquarium use is that Induction lighting is only available in 5000 K Daylight vs. a better 5500-6700 K Daylight, although this is still a viable Kelvin temperature as per PAR especially when one considers the high output delivered with half the heat output. Hopefully the companies that are making these lights will see a market in the Aquarium industry and make them in models that provide the correct PAR needed by corals and plants as these can be a nice rival to the Metal Halide, LED, and SHO! HID Xenon HID stands for ""High Intensity Discharge"", this technology is currently used in high end luxury cars, however there may be aquatic implications here in the future as PAR and other potential issues are worked out. HID lights use an electrical charge to ignite xenon gas (a colorless, heavy, odorless noble gas, which occurs in the Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts) contained in a sealed bulb.<query> what is the temperature of hid lights</query> The technology of HID automotive lamps is similar to that of common vapor-filled mercury vapor street lamps. These Xenon HID lights seem to produce much in the lower chlorophyll A segment of PAR, but currently not as much in the higher infrared part of PAR. Back To Top Important Parameters to consider when choosing a light for your aquarium (not a complete list): • Watts per gallon, • Lumens per watt, • Lumen focus • PAR (often easiest determined by Kelvin output), although it is important to note that the symbiotic zooxanthellae found in many corals and clams require more of the ""blue spike"", so high PAR for higher plants is not exactly the same for corals although it is safe to say a PAR reading of 50 mmol will work for most light sensitive corals.<query> what is the par of a aquarium light</query> • PUR/Useful Light Energy (not wasted in yellow/green light spectrum that green plants and zooanthellic algae reflect) • Output in relation to bulb length (this is where LEDs and to a lesser extent T2s and T5s excel). • Lux, I generally only consider this parameter in deeper Reef and occasionally deeper planted freshwater aquarium to determine if I am getting the proper light where it needs to be. • Specimen Placement/ Tank Depth; although not a parameter per say, it still affects lighting decisions and even the few ""watts per gallon"" generalizations I provide in this article. For instance any SPS/LPS coral placement deeper than 18-20 inches should rule out most T5 lights and deeper than 24-30 inches rules out many LED lights (24 to 30 inches at least requires the most powerful LEDs such as the AquaBeam 100 Ultra or Orphek);<query> what is the best depth for aquarium lights</query> In these deeper depths the Metal Halide is still king The watts per gallon is part of the lighting equation as stated above is highly inaccurate when taken by itself, yet may in the aquarium hobby industry still go by this outdated generalization which leaves me scratching my head with all the advances in lighting technology. Taken together, the first FIVE points are the most critical (which does include watts per gallon), but no one of these should be a sole determiner of the lights. Even a 105 watt Super High Output (SHO) which is an excellent light, especially for planted freshwater or hydroponics applications, when compared apples to apples to the 30 watt GroBeam 1000 Ultra only produces 85% of the same useful light energy despite using more than triple the energy. This is not to say the 105 SHO is not a good light, far from it, especially when one considers the vastly lower price and that this SHO light still out produces most any T12, T8 and T5 (using 6500K for all comparisons); as a generalization (assuming equal Kelvin) the SHO requires only 2 to 2.5 watts per gallon for a ""high light planted aquarium"".<query> how many watts per gallon for aquarium lights</query> Using the high end TMC or Orphek LED Lights as a Comparison: * 20 watt T12 light with a Kelvin temperature of 5000 K, Compared to a: *20 Watt LED with an adjusted Kelvin temperature of 6500 K. The ""watts per gallon rule"" would certainly require at least four of the 20 Watt T8/T12 grolite while this same 20 gallon freshwater aquarium would only require ONE 12 watt TMC GroBeam 500, this is .15 of the required wattage or about .60 Watts per gallon. For reef applications using high end LED emitters only, not Marineland Single or Double Bright, Ecoxtic Stunners, etc., I would suggest about .8 to 1 watt per gallon; so two AquaBeam Reef White LEDs would be my suggestion for this 20 gallon aquarium (generally speaking, four high end 12 watt LED Light fixtures such as the AquaBeam Reef White 600 would work well for a 60 gallon reef based on this example).<query> how many watts per gallon for reef lights</query> Of coarse the differences can vary, so even this comparison only works for the described lights and tank, this is also based on the newer Cree XR-E & XR-G Power LED emitters employed by TMC (and similar proprietary emitter bins developed by Orphek as well as some PAR 38 LEDs) which have a high output of useful energy. In fact based on raw data from controlled tests, even the modern comparable Kelvin HO T5 lights or Metal Halide which are so popular do not hold up in comparison to a modern LED with the Third Generation AquaRay LED emitters. This data indicates that a modern LED requires 14-28% of wattage for the same useful light energy output. Even then a T5 or even more so aT2 are vastly superior to the older style aquarium lights when all criteria are applied (SHO as well are also superior).<query> what is the difference between led and led aquarium lights</query> See the picture example below: An incandescent filament is very dark, and approaches being a black body radiator, so the actual temperature of an incandescent filament is somewhat close to its color temperature in Kelvins. Incandescent lamps tend to have a color temperature around 3200 K, but this is true only if they are operating with full voltage. When a lamp is dimmed below its full potential, its filament is not as hot, and it produces less light. The reduced temperature of the filament also reduces the color temperature downward. An incandescent light dimmed to 10% is considerably more red in color than one at 100%. Another consideration as to the color temperature as applied to lights; color temperature does not take into consideration the spectral distribution of a visible light source. In cases where a light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, arc-discharge burner, laser, or gas lamp, does not have a spectral distribution similar to that of a black body radiator.<query> what is the color temperature of an incandescent light</query> Note: Regular readers of this article will note that I changed/simplified my above formula. While the previous formula was always intended as an example (not a hard & fast rule/equation) and those that read this entire article in context could easily figure this out; however one of my aquarium/reef professionals who regularly proof reads this article could see how a reader could take this out context if they were to not read this article in full context (as I pointed out to him as per one extremely rude & condescending email). So as per his suggestion, I removed this formula and replaced it with the above suggested more simplified example of why the ""watts per gallon"" formula does not apply to most modern aquarium lights. Changing bulbs: With the exception of LED, most aquarium bulbs go through what is called a half life whereby they are at 50% output.<query> what is the formula for aquarium lights</query> This generally happens around 6 to 9 months in time with normal usage however with lower usage (say 8-10 hours per day) this can be stretched to 12 months. Back To Top Lighting Time Here is a summary of lighting requirements for different aquarium types. I recommend timers for any aquarium to provide good daylight/night cycles, however this is even more important with Planted Freshwater and Saltwater Reef or Nano Reef tanks. Turn the actinic lights on about one to 1/2 hour ahead of the daylight bulbs and one to 1/2 hour later in the evening. I generally have the brightest lights on for about 12 hours per day. Sometimes with MH I will have them in a third cycle that is on for only abut 10 hours or less. I would run moonlights for about 14-16 hours (some prefer to run these 24/7, however I have yet to find in benefit from this that can be scientifically proven other than aesthetics).<query> how long should a aquarium lights be on</query> Light (lamp) Placement: Pendant vs. Canopy with Reflector (Mirror, Aluminum, Mylar) The advantage to a pendant reflector over a canopy with reflective backing (mirror, aluminum or mylar reflector) is that it will radiate downward in aslightly more magnified fashion than a pendent reflector, however the reflector/mirror has one advantage over the pendant and that is more wide spread light distribution. A pendent (such as an SHO or Metal Halide) or LEDs hung on rails over an aquarium allows for an open tank which allows for more light energy to reach the tank. The negative is evaporation and possibly aesthetics (which of coarse comes down to opinion). If lights are placed in a canopy (which in my opinion looks better) it is generally best to keep a lid on the tank to prevent too much moisture from building up inside the canopy which can also damage lights.<query> why do aquarium lights need to be mounted on a canopy</query> I recommend venting the canopy and adding a small fan in at least one of the vents aimed to push airout. This will help cool the inside of the canopy/hood and, just as importantly, help expel moisture. With low heat lights such as LED and T2s, this is of less importance especially for heat, but still helps protect lights from moisture damage. The use of a reflector such as mylar (even heavy aluminum foil can work, although it tends to degrade from salty moisture over time in my experience) protects the canopy wood from heat and is useful for directing light downward, especially if SHO, T2, T5, or Compact Fluorescent lights are used. BTW, my first choice is Mylar for both reflective properties and longevity. Please the picture in the T2 Light section of this article for a canopy using Mylar (see this website as one many sources for Mylar;Mylar).<query> what is the best material to use for canopy lights</query> The use of lids (glass in particular) does block light energy and gets buildup quite quickly under the lids (although lights exposed to open tanks need to wiped clean often too), however the choice of lid can minimize energy loss (see the section lower in the article under Marine Light Summary for more about lid choices). So this choice comes down more to aesthetics, space, personal preferences, tank arrangement of plants or corals and more. Light Penetration What is often a bigger issue, especially with deep tanks (over 24 inches) is to allow as much of the blue light (which is found as part of the light spectrum of high PAR Daylight 6400 K lights) as possible through to the tank and often a glass top will block these light rays (over 60%) so using polycarbonate or no lid at all may do more for effectiveness than whether you use a mirror or pendent (see further in this article for more on this subject).<query> what is the best light source for a deep coral tank</query> As well for tanks over 24 inches the use of some higher Kelvin in your light ""mix"" may be necessary for coral tanks or in some cases high light requiring plant tanks (depending upon the environment being replicated, as a high tannin, often shaded Amazon River tanks would not require the light intensity and higher Kelvin output of a Reef Tank). The use of 14,000 K MH (or even higher Kelvin 20,000K MH) or AquaBeam Ultra 1000 Marine White LED in a mix with High PAR 6400 K SHO lights may provide the ""mix"" necessary for deeper freshwater tanks. For Marine, even in tanks under 24 inches, the use of actinic blue lights may help provide the correct PAR to specimens lower in your tanks water column; aLED Reef Blue 50,000K may help provide this (this LED along with the Marine Blue is also excellent deeper tank penetration).<query> what light intensity is needed for coral reef tanks</query> Here is the general light spectrum absorption of water: • Only 73% of the surface light reaches a depth of 1 centimeter (less than a half inch) • Only 44.5% of the surface light reaches a depth of 1 meter (3.3 feet) Back To Top Specimen Placement This is an important consideration that is often missed or not enough weight is given to this part of aquarium lighting and aquascaping Reef: Another important point that is often missed by many reef keepers (usually newbies) is even with newer technology high output lights (such as a MH, LED, HO T5, T2, or SHO), specimen placement can make or break a good light system. As per the previous section as to general light absorption of water, I would move corals as high up in the water column as possible, this is especially important with SPS corals (short polyp stony corals) where placement on the rocks directly under your lights is even more essential.<query> what is the light spectrum of coral</query> This is not as essential with LPS corals (long polyp stony corals) since they are more commonly found in near the sandy lagoon bottoms. Sometimes in conversations with reef enthusiasts that are questioning different lighting systems/ideas is that it is often missed that the most high light requiring corals (such as SPS) donot grow 100 feet (30 meters) below the surface in the reefs and that these corals will be just below the surface, so regardless of the lights you choose, placement is extremely important. Even less light demanding tropical reef building corals species are restricted to the euphotic zone, the region in the ocean where light penetrates to a depth of approximately 230 feet or 70 meters (there are cold water corals that grow in deeper water, however these are not the reef building corals kept in aquariums that secrete calcium carbonate).<query> what is the depth of light for coral reefs</query> I should also note that with SPS corals in my own experience, that placement low or even in substrate that I have observed the corals getting ""eaten away"" by bacteria from the bottom up; while this is an anecdotal observation of mine (as other factors were not tested in a controlled scientific study), it is still consideration in coral specimen placement. The bottom line is that you can have the best lighting system that money can buy, but poor placement of specimens can make it all for not. Another thought as marine tanks in general, is to consider what type of environment you attempting to duplicate; for instance a Reef Tank set up to duplicate the Great Barrier Reef would require aquascaping and higher power lighting to best replicate this environment. While a marine tank set up to replicate the much more turbid waters off the California coast would not require the same aquascaping or as high power of lighting.<query> what is the best lighting for a coral reef</query> Freshwater: If your lights are for Freshwater plants I would move the high light requiring plants directly under the lights (I generally elevate them with terracing, which can look quite attractive if done well and serve a dual purpose of aesthetics and better light energy absorption). As with marine tanks, consider the environment you are replicating; for instance an Amazon River environment aquarium (with fish such as Discus) are full of tannins and have many shady areas and so one cannot compare the lighting needs of a tropical reef with the Amazon River. More light and dark spots should be utilized so as to provide a more natural and comfortable environment for your aquarium inhabitants, as well the same intense lighting for the same size Tropical Reef tank should not be used for an Amazon River aquarium of the same size and depth.<query> what is the purpose of aquarium lights</query> A few notes about Kelvin: * Plant chlorophyll absorbs light at wavelengths of 300 to 700 nm (a Kelvin rating of about 6400 strikes a good balance here, which is why this is the best Kelvin temperature for freshwater plants and symbiotic zooxanthellae in corals). * The lower the ""K"", the more yellow, then red the light appears, such as a 4500 K bulb. * The higher the ""K"", the bluer the light appears, such as a 20,000 K bulb. *Higher Kelvin Color Temperature lights penetrate water more deeply, even more so in saltwater, however there is less of the infrared ""PAR spike"" as well. * The human eye sees mostly sees light around 5500K. * Candle flame = 1850 – 1900 K * Sunlight (1 hour after dawn) = 3500 K * Typical summer light (sun + sky) = 6500 K * Cool white fluorescent = 4200 K *Different nanometer wavelengths can be used to reach the same Kelvin Temperature; just as 4+5 & 1+8 both equal 9, so can different nanometer wavelengths be used for the same Kelvin Temperature.<query> what is the kelvin temperature</query> • IMPORTANT- Another point about lighting in general is that higher wave lengths of light such as UVA do not penetrate glass well or even acrylic. I recommend direct lighting (best), quartz or polycarbonate where UVA is essential. Just make sure to clean your bulbs or polycarbonate tops regularly to prevent build up that will block light. Even though infrared will penetrate glass, it will not penetrate dirty glass with algae or hard water deposits on it, so keep your aquarium cover clean for any tank where lighting is important such as FW plants or Reef Aquariums. Here is a very basic breakdown of UV blocking potential: *Glass- about 60% of UV will be blocked *Acrylic- about 40% *Polycarbonate- about 8-10% (this is what I used when a lid was necessary)<query> what type of light blocks uv</query> *Quartz- about .5-2% Back To Top TANK SET UP LIGHTING SUGGESTIONS: Please note that I have received many requests for exact recommendations of lights for certain aquariums. I prefer to not give these as there are too many variables which then will make my advice anecdotal, as with Aquarium Medications, Chemistry, & similar subjects I prefer to give as many tools for the aquarium keeper to make an educated decision on his/her own. As well since Lighting is a fast changing part of aquarium keeping, a recommendation I make today may be less accurate in a year (or less). As a guide I will make a few suggestions in the following sections based on a 20 Gallon, 60, & 100 aquarium (hopefully readers can extrapolate their aquarium recommendations from the aquarium size that is most similar to theirs.<query> what size aquarium lights do i need</query> *With each example I will break it down to aquarium keeping types. *As per ""Light Type"", I will provide T2, T5, T8, CFL, SHO, MH, & LED (with LEDs, this will ONLY mean high output (HO) LEDs, not the plethora of low end LEDs such as those marketed by E.Shine of China) *With mixes of lights whether LED with T2 or T5 OR all LEDs with Daylight and Reef Blue, you can stagger on/off times such as blues (actinics) coming on 1/2 to 1 hour before the daylight and off 1/2 to 1 hour after daylight (such as 10-12 hours of daylight and 12-14 hours of blue). Please take these only as suggestions, NOT something written in stone. In fact, there are so many variations that can come together for the best lighting to fit your aquarium needs (think of how 2+8=10 as well as 4+6=10; in other words there are many options, including mixing and matching to reach the same goal of correct lighting for your aquariums specific needs) Some will note that the LED lighting suggestions below are MORE than the .8 or .6 watts per gallon we suggest elsewhere in our articles (Ditto for other lighting types).<query> how long does it take for aquarium lights to go off</query> The reason for this is that while the .8 watts per gallon is enough HO LED light for your tank, it may not cover your tank entirely, leaving some dark areas. This is why you will find more light suggested here versus elsewhere. Please consider all I have written up to this point, your personal aquarium parameters, exact inhabitants, budget (which is always important), & more when deciding what lighting systems or combinations there of to use. 20 GALLON Light Type Freshwater Freshwater Planted Saltwater;

however specimen placement or tank depth, lighting type strengths and weaknesses must be considered too. I have made several watts per gallon generalizations throughout this article, but these are meant as ""apples to apples"" comparisons (High Output LED to High Output LED, T5 to T5, etc.), not apples to oranges (such as SHO to T12, or High Output LED to low output LED such as Marineland LEDs) Please note that besides years of personal fresh and saltwater keeping experience, MUCH more of this information I have written here comes from research OUTSIDE the aquarium industry. Much of what I have learned (and I am STILL learning) comes from this constant research of as many lighting tech research as I can read often from horticulture or other outside sources as noted earlier.<query> how many watts per gallon for aquarium lighting</query> Some examples include the lack of information in the aquarium industry/hobby that must be found elsewhere includes the SHO or T2 lights that are often superior to more commonly recommended bulbs in the aquarium hobby,yet in much better funded lighting and horticultural industry literature/information these lights are much better known. There is also good evidence that correct lighting benefits ALL fish as well, including salt & freshwater fish. I have observed better disease resistance in marine fish in loosely controlled studies when lighting is upgraded to higher intensity, high PAR lights. Proper lighting may play a role in nutrient assimilation, improvedRedox, lower incidence of Brown Diatom Algae. Studies in humans that show an impact of lighting on health, may have strong implications for fish (this may be a factor in my studies that showed higher disease resistance when lighting is improved).<query> why is aquarium lighting good for fish</query> Lighting that as closely duplicates the sun (not necessarily light that is most pleasing to us) is important for ALL life, although more noticeably for corals and plants. Fish too are part of this chain of life. Basically if you take away the sun and the energy it provides, you take away life itself and I do not think if you are trying to achieve the best environment for your fish whether fresh or saltwater, you are doing them a favor by depriving of this source of energy, so duplicating this is one more part of your ""aquarium keeping puzzle"" (see ""Aquarium Disease Prevention""). I should point out that obviously, some fish prefer subdued light, but this is easily handled by hiding places, caves, plants (live or artificial), products such as Peat or Indian Almond Leaves that ""color"" the water, and simple placement of lights where as some areas of the aquarium are better lit than others with plants/corals placed in way that benefit the most in these areas.<query> why is it important to keep fish in a aquarium</query> Please click on the link below for a pdf downloadable web page of this article, this can be saved to your iBooks, Computer, etc. Aquarium Lighting; pdf (as of 12-27-11) References (there are many more scattered within this article): *""WHY IS WATER BLUE"" *""FACTS OF LIGHT- Color Temperature (Kelvin)"" *""THE KRIB- Aquarium Light intensities comparisons "" *""AQUA BOTANIC- A Comparison between Light Sources Used in Planted Aquaria"" *http://www.ledgrowlights.com/ *http://www.uky.edu/~jholl2/technology_pdfs/KelvinColorTemperature.pdf *http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/colortemperature/index.html * http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/Spectrpy/UV-Vis/spectrum.htm *http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2008/12/aafeature1 *The Staff atQuality Marine USA for their expert input and Lighting knowledge to this article *American Aquarium Design and Maintenance as well as many other Professional Aquarium Maintenance Companies for their input and test results that went into this article as well as help with CONTINUOUS Updates!!<query> why is water blue in aquarium lighting</query> For more about my ""how"" and ""why"" of my article writing:""Aquarium Information"" For more aquarium information and articles (pond too), please visit this site: Aquarium Information Back To Top If you have found this site helpful (or the sister site Aquarium and Pond Answers), please consider a donation to help with the 100s of hours of research and regular updates that go into these articles: | Basic_Aquarium_Principles | Basic_Saltwater | Aquarium_Disease | Aquarium_Lighting | Goldfish_disease | Aquarium_cleaning | Nitrogen_Cycle | Redox_Potential | Clear-Pond | Aquarium_Filtration | Articles | Music-2 | TestFiltration | | Return Home | Downloads | Shipping and Return Policy | Contact Us | Great Links | Aquarium_Information | Privacy-Policy | Copyright © 2012, American Aquarium Products.<query> what is the name of the aquarium</query> This is why often comparing one 6500K lamp to another can often be ""apples to oranges"" as for necessary useful light energy (PUR) needed by plants or corals What Kelvin rating for Plants & Corals; Here are some observations made by me and others in the professional aquarium maintenance community, some of these are simple observations, while others were based on more controlled tests. *The 6500 Kevin lamps have produced the best freshwater plant growth (as this Kelvin lamp generally has more of the infrared nm spike needed by ""higher"" plants, but still has some of the 425-500 nm blue). This Kelvin Lamp can also work with SPS, LPS placed high in the tank water column (nearest the lights) based on the symbiotic zooxanthellae needs found in these corals. For more depth penetration (& to aid in the first blue spike in PAR, please see PAR section), blue actinic, 50,000 K/Actinic or adjustable/multiple LED can be added (such asAquaBeam Marine Blue) can balance out 6500K lamp if used in marine reef tanks.<query> what kelvin rating is best for corals</query> Please note that saltwater absorbs slightly more light energy than freshwater due to the higher density of the water, so 6500 will not penetrate as deeply and are not a good choice for depths over 12 inches despite some Reef Lights such as the ""AI Sol LED"" utilizing this Kelvin Temperature output in their reef lights. *The 9000-10,000 Kelvin lamps also achieve good growth rates, although slower than the 6500 K bulbs in shallow aquariums. 9000 to 10000K bulbs have produced excellent growth with soft corals and LPS, although slower paced SPS growth. The 10,000K can be a good choice for achieving PAR for better depth penetration than a 6500K bulb (such as 12-20 inch or even deeper aquarium) *The 14,000K light/lamp (often popular with Metal Halide and LEDs), will penetrate even more than the 10,000K light while still providing useful PAR (this would be the highest ""Daylight"" Kelvin temperature I would recommend and still expect good growth in corals, see PAR section).<query> what temperature is good for coral growth</query> An excellent daylight color for tanks between 15 and 30 inches in depth. *The 20,000 K light/lamp is more blue yet and brings out all of the fluorescent pigments in many corals (making for a very nice appearance). However the many tests and observations show that when used alone except in tanks over 24 inches, the growth rate of SPS corals can come be slowed or even come to a standstill with 20,000 K lamps. Although a good supplement for appearance and deep tanks, these bulbs generally should not be used as theonly reef Kelvin temperature in tanks under 24 inches. *The 50,000K is generally the Kelvin rating of an actinic blue light source which is beneficial for the first ""spike"" in PAR. This temperature light (as with 20,000K) is best used with other light Kelvin Temperatures and is a better choice than the 20,000K light for such combinations.<query> what temperature light is best for coral reef</query> The 50,000K is a good compliment to the 6500, 10,000, 14,000 Kelvin lights, especially for zooanthellic algae necessary for stony corals, clams, nudibranch, anemones, and other sessile species. Here is a quote as per their experience with Kelvin Temperature for a freshwater Planted aquarium: ""I had a 175, 6700K Metal Halide over my 22gallon cube, and then switched it over to a 14K bulb I had when I used to do saltwater just to see the difference. I didn't like the blue appearance nor how it made the plants look odd. True, my neon tetras glowed more blue as did my beta, but the plants looked weird. I went back to the 6700K last night to make my final decision. Everything looked much better under that light. It is under 6700K that I got explosive growth when I added a good, CO2 reactor.<query> what is the best temperature for kelvin light</query> After I switched back to the 6700K, my plants were pearling away, and they had their true colors and natural look again! If I decide down the road to change to a saltwater fish only with live rock, I can still use the 6700K lights (I won't go back to raising corals - it was good experience, but in all honesty, I found it boring). People need to use the proper spectrum - they shouldn't use what pleases them; they must use what pleases what you are trying to grow/raise be it fish, corals, or plants. You become the shepherd so tend your flock accordingly (corny but true)."" Gary Sanders Simple Basic Kelvin Temperature Comparison Test: First this test is quite accurate when comparing ""apples to apples"", in other words one 6500K CFL to another.<query> what temperature is kelvin</query> Simply provide a ""control"" light such as a new CFL, SHO, T2, T5 with the SAME Kelvin rating. Then use a clean plain piece of white computer printer paper and shine the light through this paper. The results should provide obvious degradation of light color (often less blue since this is often a nanometer color to go first). This can also be used for comparison of LEDs, SHO, T%, etc where a light (even if new) is suspected of not producing the correct color. This test is very accurate for the above use, but CANNOT show what light energy wave lengths that go into the kelvin temperature and is not accurate for comparing (as an example) a T2 6500K to a 6500K LED (although it can make for interesting comparisons between different lights and even different Kelvin lights).<query> what is the correct kelvin rating for led lights</query> Kelvin summary The Kelvin rating is another area of comparing apples to apples in lights, not just watts. Although the above is a simplified explanation of Kelvin as it applies to lights; as such you cannot compare a 6400 K T8 light to a 6400 MH light (the MH is going to have much more output as you will read later). However (using a CFL as an example, this can apply to any light type), a 6400K CFL will have a higher useful energy output than a 3500K CFL, this is why an incandescent filament is very low in Kelvin (dark) as derived from the actual temperature as it is just above a black body radiator. This does not mean that a certain Kelvin bulb is necessarily ""better"" as factors such as ""lumens per watt"", watts, focused lumens and especially PAR/PUR MUST be considered as well.<query> what is the kelvin rating of a light bulb</query> Parameters Watts Per Gallon Comparison Light on time & change Lamp placement Specimen Placement Tank Set Up Suggestions PDF Download Summary References Related Information/ Products For the most current technology in Aquarium LED lights such as the AquaRay ; LED Aquarium Lights with CREE XR-E Power LEDs, the best emitters at any price For the next generation in HO micro compact lighting: T2 Next Generation Sub Miniature Aquarium Lights Superior output to CFL and even T5 for the energy used For first quality UV Hot Cathode UVC Bulbs: UV Bulbs TMC Fluidized Sand Bed Filters The TMC Premium Fluidized Sand Bed Filter increases Bio Capacity of any Aquarium system, with unsurpassed Nitrifying Bio-Filtration superior to most Canister Filters TMC Reverse Osmosis Filter System with TDS Meter The TMC Advanced Aquarium RO Water Filter system includes a TDS meter and operates at less than 2 cents per gallon AQUARIUM LIGHTING<query> what is the best aquarium light</query> References: http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/colortemperature/index.html Color Temperature in a Virtual Radiator- This is an interesting resource with a virtual radiator worth checking out. We have currently disabled this link as it is crashing our browsers, once we determine it is working. http://www.uky.edu/~jholl2/technology_pdfs/KelvinColorTemperature.pdf http://www.sizes.com/units/color_temperature.htmBack To Top 2: THE NANOMETER RANGE (SPECTRUM) A nanometer scale is used to measure the wave length of light energy from cosmic rays to radio waves. An actinic bulb will have a Nanometer spike at about 420nm, a UVC bulb about 265nm, and a daylight bulb about multiple spikes from 400 to 700nm. The difference in the wavelength determines how the wave affects its surroundings. It is this wavelength difference that allows short-wave x-ray to pass through walls, while longer-wave visible light cannot pass though the same material; short-wave ultraviolet and x-ray can destroy DNA in living microorganisms and breakdown organic material while visible light will not.<query> what is the wavelength of a light bulb</query> All light energy is measured on a ""nanometer"" (nm) scale. Nanometer means one-billionth of a meter. This applies to aquariums when we consider the light spectrum and how it applies to our aquariums individual needs: Red light is the first to be filtered out and can only penetrate a short distance. As light waves penetrate deeper into the water, orange and yellow are lost next. Of all the colors of the spectrum blue light penetrates the deepest. Corals need intense equatorial UVA (actinic) as well as other aspects of PAR. Most higher plants need a balanced PAR/PUR light range which includes the blue and two red spikes required for photosynthesis (see section about PAR & PUR). The Nanometer scale and Kelvin temperatures come together when applied to aquarium lighting this way; Natural sunlight on a clear day registers at 5500- 6500 Kelvin degrees.<query> what is the color of the light spectrum in a coral reef</query> Kelvin temperatures less than 5500K become more red and yellow and the higher the Kelvin temperature the more blue the light is. Most photosynthetic invertebrates should be kept with lamps of a daylight Kelvin temperature from 6400-14,000 K (higher Kelvin with deeper specimen placement, not necessarily tank depth). 20,000K daylight lamps can also be used for deeper tanks, however I have found it better to use a 14,000K Daylight or less supplemented with more blue (400nm- 550nm). Photosynthetic invertebrates (many corals, anemones, clams, nudibranch, etc.) also need more blue (400-550nm) than ""higher"" plants especially as tanks increase in depth, with 465-485 recently being shown the optimum blue. Not only is blue/actinic lighting beneficial to photosynthetic invertebrates, it is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye when used to supplement ""daylight"" lighting.<query> what temperature is best for photosynthetic invertebrates</query> Freshwater aquarium plants benefit from lighting with a Kelvin temperature in the range of approximately 6500 degrees. Freshwater plants prefer light with more red in the spectrum (see PAR Section). It is noteworthy that Fluorescent and even more so incandescent lights produce a lot of yellow and green nanometer light, which research indicates is mostly wasted energy in terms of the needs or freshwater plants and SPS Corals. This is where anLED Aquarium Light, Metal Halide, or even (to a lesser degree) T2 Lights excels as there is much less wasted yellow/green light. See the picture to the left that shows a T8 5500 daylight aquarium light that is commonly sold, this graph clearly shows the wasted green/yellow energy as well as the incorrect spike in orange rather than the correct PAR spike in red 630+ nm (click to enlarge) It is also noteworthy that many ""terrestrial plant lights"" as well as many aquarium plant lights (often are lower in kelvin temperature) have more ""red nanometer spikes"" than higher kelvin 6500k, 10,000k & higher lamps.<query> what temperature is the best light for aquarium plants</query> The problem with these lights is that while all plants utilizing photosynthesis require the same essential ABCs of PAR (see the PAR section), the facts of light energy penetrating water requires higher kelvin (6500k +) be added to provide maximum PUR (see Useful light energy/PUR section). Aquatic Plants and corals have adapted/evolved to the natural light energy at certain depth of water and the misguided attempt to adapt these terrestrial plant lights is not going to be 100% effective as a light with more water penetrating blue & slightly lower red nm energy. 3: LUX: A measure of the intensity of light (referred to the photometry of light), one lux is equal to one lumen per square meter. Once again this is another area of comparing apples to apples in lights, not just watts.<query> what is the difference between watts and lux</query> It is noteworthy that a LUX Reading ONLY reports light intensity to which the human eye is most sensitive (green light) However this can still be a useful tool for freshwater plants & most corals in marine reef aquariums. When the Lux is not enough the zooxanthellae (inside of corals tissues) do not create plentiful oxygen. The minimum light intensity should be no less than 3,000-lux when it reaches the deepest part of the aquarium. You can over light your coral to a light saturation point (quite hard in my experience, but this should be noted), maximum Lux should be no more than 100,000 to 120,000. By comparison Lux in tropical reefs has been measured to be between 110,000 and 120,000 Lux at the surface of the reef and 20,000-25,000 Lux one meter below the surface.<query> what is the minimum light intensity for coral reefs</query> Back To Top 4: PAR: PAR is one of the more important considerations along with the even MORE important related Useful Light Energy (aka PUR which literally stands for Photosynthetically Useful Radiation). I have noticed that PAR is both over looked & over-rated (meaning PUR is more important) by both marine and freshwater plant keeping aquarists. PAR is the abbreviation for Photosynthetically Active Radiation which is the spectral range of solar light from 400 to 700 nanometers that is needed by plants & symbiotic zooanthellic algae (Zooxanthellae are single-celled plants that live in the tissues of animals such as corals, clams, anemones, & nudibranchs) for photosynthesis. In particular, this is found from actinic UVA to infrared. UVA is 400-550nm(of which 465-485 has the highest PAR of the actinic range) which is the absorption bandwidth of chlorophylls a, c², and peridinin (the light-harvesting carotenoid, a pigment related to chlorophyll).<query> what is par</query> Low (near) Infrared is 620-720nm which is the red absorption bandwidth of chlorophylls a and c².(I should note for the technical ""purists"" that might read this article, true infrared is beyond 750 nm, but as per my many resources the energy spikes in the red spectrum are generally referred to as infrared or near infrared) Photons at shorter wavelengths (UVC) tend to be so energetic that they can be damaging to cells and tissues; fortunately they are mostly filtered out by the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Green light occupies the middle spectrum (550-620nm; what is mostly visible to us) and is partly why chlorophyll is green due to the reflective properties. Bulbs that emit mostly actinic light will have a lower PAR (although actinic UVA still occupies an spike in PAR as seen from the graph and improves the PAR of your lighting), bulbs that occupy mostly the middle spectrum (yellow-green) such as ""warm White (2700- 3500K ) will produce little necessary PAR, while bulbs that produce mostly infrared (as seen from the graph) will produce more important PAR light energy,however it is the balance of infrared and UVA that will generally provide your best PAR output .<query> what is the middle spectrum of light</query> Important Definitions as it applies PAR in plants and zooanthellic algae: See the graph to the left as it corresponds to each of these definitions. *A: Phototropic response; having a tendency to move in response to light. Basically this is the Chlorophyll containing plant or algae ""moving"" to respond to a positive light source to begin the process of photosynthesis (initial growth of plants, zooxanthellae, etc.). This is found in the 420-500nm ""blue"" spectrum. *B: Photosynthetic response; the process which begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called photosynthetic reaction centers that contain chlorophylls. *C: Chlorophyll synthesis is the chemical reactions and pathways by the plant hormone cytokinin soon after exposure to the correct Nanometers wave length (about 670 NM) of light resulting in the formation of chlorophyll, resulting in continued growth of a plant, algae, zooxanthellae and the ability to ""feed"" & propagate, and without this aspect PAR (670 NM light energy), zooxanthellae and plants cannot properly ""feed"" propagate.<query> what is the par in plants</query> The results of the lack of this high PAR ""spike"" would be stunted freshwater plant growth, and eventually poor coral health in reef tanks. This lack of near-red light over 630nm is common to many so-called aquarium lights (such as the diagram at the bottom of the Nanometers section). *With this in mind and based on better funded tests/studies outside the aquarium industry show that many stony corals, clams, and other sessile species that depend on photosynthesis of zooanthellic algae not only thrive but also propagate with light that achieves the optimum PAR, which includes daylight from as low as 6500k. When the amount of energy used (in watts) is considered, this can include6400 SHO lamps which can generally penetrate most freshwater tanks well and also perform well in marine reef tanks under 18 inches of depth when balanced with blue/actinic lights necessary for the higher need of 465-485nm light energy by symbiotic zooanthellic algae).<query> what is the par for aquarium lights</query> By Carl Strohmeyer Updated 2/04/12 OVERVIEW When choosing your aquarium lighting (especially Reef or Planted Freshwater), there is much more to consider than watts per gallon. In fact is the 2-5 watts per gallon 'rule' is a VERY basic start (this rule varies depending upon what is kept & who you ask), however this is very general and quite out-dated due to the variety available modern lights with varying lumens per watt lights, different wavelength, focused lumens, PAR/PUR output, etc. Sadly the watts per gallon ""rule"" for aquarium lighting is still thrown around today despite all the technological advances in lighting which often makes this grossly inaccurate. As an example, a high PAR/PUR LED from the most exclusive/best emitter bins can only need 4% of the wattage as a household T12 to produce the same results (about 15% for better aquarium T8 or T12 lamps), but even then many LEDs available such as those sold by mass merchandisers are not of high useful PAR output (PUR), as these often use much lower quality emitters with poor PUR output.<query> how many watts per gallon for aquarium lights</query> Further PAR Information; As the reader here can see, there are three main spikes in the PAR spectrum, with all three being important, however the most important spikes occur at the red side and all three are generally incorporated more or less in a daylight bulb of approximately 6500K. As a light energy penetrates deeper through water, these ""red spikes"" need to move slightly ""left"" (lower) on the nanometer graph so as to allow for proper use of PAR (in other words Photosynthetically useful radiation; please see the PUR section). This means higher kelvin lamps of 9,000k to as high as 20,000k may need to be employed. This can vary with bulb type though as not all so-called daylight bulbs are the same, see theUseful Light Energy section of this article. *Besides the obvious depth penetration, it is also noteworthy that most green algae need more of the actinic spike than ""higher plants"", hence the popularity of actinic lights for reef aquariums, however the optimum nanometer range is about 465-485nm, not the lower 420nm many actinic lights produce or the more broad range many ""blue"" aquarium lights produce of 400-520 nm (this is where the latest technology LED lights ""shine"", having a more precise 465-485nm blue).<query> what is the wavelength of the par spectrum</query> For this reason it is a good idea to have extra actinic for corals/clams that depend upon zooanthellic algae, while at the same time limiting blue/actinic in freshwater aquariums to avoid excessive green algae growth. *Planted Freshwater Aquariums: It is also important to note that freshwater algae also prefer more of the ""blue"" UVA light so the use of actinic blue lighting should be avoided in planted freshwater aquariums, as well the use of higher Kelvin Daylight (14,000K or especially 20,000K) should also be avoided in all but the deepest tanks since higher Kelvin Daylight lamps produce higher amounts of ""blue"" light. Otherwise many freshwater plants may not be able to ""out compete"" against some algae such as hair algae. *More recent studies show that excessive low UVA (under 420nm) and especially UVB radiation can actually bleach coral, so use of excessive blue lighting under 420nm should be avoided.<query> what light is best for freshwater aquariums</query> Measuring PAR Although Kelvins (as well as LUX conversions using questionable LUX to PAR conversion factors) are ways of getting rough estimates of PAR, only a Specific PAR Meter (also called Quantum Light Meters) can give you the best measurement of this aspect of determining your tanks lighting requirements (both at the surface and under the surface) (Here is a link to a PAR Meter Apogee MQ-200 PAR Meter) Currently accepted numbers measured as µMol•m²•sec (also referred to as micro mols or mmol) are 50 mmol for most plants or low light corals such asNemezophyllia, while Acropora can require PAR outputs as high as 300 mmol (any higher is simply a waste of energy/light) HOWEVER, keep in mind that a PAR Meter is not accurate in important light energy spikes WITHIN the 400 to 700 nanometer range, so while one light might measure a higher PAR mmol reading, another light might be still superior due to the more important PUR output (this is where I have found the use of a PAR Meter over rated by some).<query> what is the par for a coral tank</query> Some organisms, such as Cyanobacteria, purple bacteria and Heliobacteria, can make use of the unusable light discarded by the plant kingdom, in this case, light outside the PAR range required by plants, which is why Cyanobacteria thrive in lighting conditions that include the more yellow 4000 K and below and why actinic (50,000K) as well as balanced light in the 6400 to 14,000K range combined with passing water through an ultra violet sterilizer (to kill free floating Cyanobacteria) is important for control. In the case of Red Slime Cyanobacteria, these Cyanobacteria do not use the PAR spikes at 465nm and 675nm and instead utilize more of the middle yellow and green light spectrum that is most common fluorescent (even so-called aquarium fluorescent lights) and incandescent lighting. *Please do not confuse the term PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) used in plant growth as discussed here with another use of the same term in lighting which is Parabolic Aluminized Reflector.<query> what light spectrum is used by cyanobacteria</query> This type of light is used for stage lighting and should not be purchased for marine, freshwater, or Greenhouse use under the mistaken belief that these lights are ""great"" for plant/coral growth. *For further reading (references) about PAR: *Light and Plants *A rational approach to light measurements in plant ecology * Photosynthetically Active Radiation * http://www.aquariumpros.com/articles%20PDF/lamptypes.pdf *Fish Health: Many recent studies have shown the importance of full spectrum lighting (which will generally encompass a high PAR value) as it relates to health in humans & animals, can be extrapolated to fish as well for a disease prevention which is why good lighting should not be restricted to Reef Marine or Planted Freshwater Aquariums, but to fish only salt or freshwater tanks as well. In fact the medical community is now utilizing 6400K SHO lights (& similar full spectrum lights) due to increasing studies that show better immune function, mental health, and more.<query> what is the par value for aquarium lights</query> Animal studies support similar results as well. See these references: *New Science Sheds Light on Immune Deficiencies *Light as a NutrientBack To Top 5: Useful Light Energy (PUR): PUR (Photosynthetically Usable Radiation) also known as ""Useful Light Energy"" is what concerns us as aquarium keepers even considerably more than PAR in providing correct lighting (yet provides a lot of confusion, especially when considering LED Lights). PUR is that fraction of PAR that is absorbed by zooxanthellae photopigments thereby stimulating photosynthesis. As noted above, PUR are those wavelengths falling between 400-550nm and 620-740nm. Generally a Spectrograph is used to rate PUR (these are much more expensive than a PAR meter, with the result of many falsely considering PAR and ignoring the more important PUR.)<query> what is pur</query> It is noteworthy that whereas higher plants (generally kept in planted freshwater aquariums) require more of the infrared aspect of the PAR Spectrum while the zooxanthellae found inside many sensitive corals require more of the Blue spike 400 -550 (465-485 in particular according to more recent research). For this reason either/both higher Kelvin Daylight and actinic/blue is required for many reef aquariums. *As noted in the PAR section the exact nanometer spikes will need to be lower so as to provide the actual PUR, for this reason popular a ""red"" 5000-5500k plant light is NOT the best light for any water application except for very shallow water since the spikes are not adjusted for water penetration. Balancing these plant lights such as the ""Aqua Flora"" with 6500k to 10,000k lights is necessary for best results (such a combination may have the added benefit of certain plants growing more toward the surface).<query> what is the best light for a coral reef</query> *It is also noteworthy as per recent head to head studies with acopora corals that photosynthetic corals found in waters increasing in depth have adapted to PUR of increasingly bluer light spectrums and thus lights with too much red can actually stop coral growth altogether. The ability of newer technology lights to pin point the exact nanometer spectrums in output results in much less wasted energy and allows for a light of considerably lower wattage to actually out produce another bulb of higher wattage that wastes much of its energy in light bands that are not useful for life processes (this is major reason the ""watts per gallon rule"" is so useless when applied to modern technology, yet it is still thrown around by many). Even the best of fluorescent lights that are a Kelvin temperature of 6500 K use a percentage of their light energy in the yellow and green light spectrum which is mostly useless for aquarium plants or corals (LEDs & modern T2s/ T5s do not suffer as much from this problem from what I have observed using a light filtering lens).<query> what wavelengths of light do corals use</query> This is where although a 6000-8000K light generally will provide good PAR often there is also more yellow/green light. When used in water applications (especially as depths increase), one aspect of a higher Kelvin (10,000- 14000K) daylight lamp is more efficient penetration (although Kelvin temperatures much over 14000K loose much of the important 700nm ""spike"" & should be avoided as theonly light source) The picture above demonstrates this with two 15 Watt CFL (30 watts total) vs. one12 Watt Marine White LED (all white 14,000K emitters). This picture is taken with a camera that filters out certain wave lengths allowing for a better viewing of the difference which is otherwise not easy to discern, however the picture shows how the LED on the left has less of this wasted yellow and green than the CFL lights on the right.<query> what is the kelvin temperature of a marine led</query> Otherwise the light output appears the same, although this is still important when you consider that this is achieved with only 12 watts of LED vs. 30 watts of Compact Fluorescent lights. Please click on the pictures to enlarge With some LED Lights, new technology LED emitters can be selected for the exact wavelength of light, thus much less useless yellow or green light is emitted, so although the LED may seem less bright than some HO lights with the naked eye (such as T5s or MH) the actual output of light energy in spectrums we cannot see is much higher. This is why gauging a light by what you see is highly inaccurate. The Picture to the left shows the light spectrum as seen through a special 3D lens which breaks apart the light spectrum. This provides a dramatic example of how much of the light energy the 4000K CFL is in the useless yellow spectrum (the 4000K is not a terrible bulb either, as many still use this for plants).<query> what is the difference between led and cfl</query> Please read the full article here to understand why the Watts per gallon isonly part of the equation for your aquarium light determination. As you will read more later in this article a watt is simply a measurement of energy NOT light output or even quality. Even comparable lumen output at the lamp is no longer a good measure of lighting parameter performance due to PAR, PUR, focus, and restrike; as noted earlier a good example is a modern LED (such as theAqua Ray) which has a vastly higher PUR output than a comparable wattage CFL. There are other factors effecting lighting for your aquarium than just watt output. For example: You cannot compare the output of a 150 watt Metal Halide to a 150 watt outdoor floodlight. Nor an 85 watt standard incandescent to a85 Watt 6400 K SHO Bulb.<query> what is the wattage of a aquarium light bulb</query> The TMC Reef White shows a much more complete light spectrum and much less wasted energy in the useless light spectrums. IMPORTANT Further/Newer Information as to Useful Light Energy: As alluded to earlier in this section, EVEN a Spectrograph (which I admittedly use to make certain points) should not be the only determining factor for ""Useful Light Energy"" as these only rate the light spectrums of a light in air, NOT under water so as to determine PUR. However when increasing depth of water are thrown into the equation (in particular for photosynthetic marine life), these spectrographs become less accurate as these corals and other photosynthetic marine life have adapted to the wave lengths of light energy that reaches their depths, which the spectrograph cannot show. Obviously this is more blues and/or ""bluer"" daylights (such as 14,000k or 20,000k).<query> what is useful light energy</query> For this reason I prefer the less scientific, but in my opinion more accurate term of ""Useful Light Energy"" over PUR. This also has implications even in equal quality but different lights such as a TMC Reef White 1000 (with 14,000k daylight emitters) versus a TMC 1500 XG. The 9000k emitters in the 9000k XG are simply not a good light energy source for tanks over 24 inches, but are an excellent source for tanks under 20 inches (especially under 15 inches). Further explanations to hopefully convey the importance of the concept of ""Useful Light Energy""; *I have noted that a dozen ""hardware store"" cool white fluorescent lights can provide adequate lighting for a planted aquarium and even basic reefs, however it would only take a few correct kelvin (for the application) T5 lights to accomplish this same task.<query> what is the best light source for a reef</query> The point is that even a T12 cool white provides some useful light energy, but it takes copious amounts of these lights (& wattage) to work correctly (in other word many more watts, which again speaks against the ""watts per Gallon rule"") *In another comparison, one can use one of the many cheap LED panels commonly sold that use 90-120 watts or more to light a reef or planted aquarium, or you can use a LED Fixture that utilizes the best technology emitters available such as only found in many TMC AquaRay LED Lights. This is similar to the above example as lower end emitters donot pin point the important light wave lengths the best patented emitters can (think about lighting your aquarium with 100's of LED flashlights, would you do this?). *As a final comparison, it is important to note as per PUR, that for instance one 6500k light is not the same as another as there is more than one way to mix light ""colors"" (wave lengths) to achieve a certain kelvin temperature rating.<query> how many watts does an aquarium light need</query> Think about how mixing all paint colors will produce black, while the mixing of all light energy produces white. We as humans may notice this to some degree, however we do not have the ability to pick out particular colors such as a honey bee can; as well photosynthetic aquatic life also has differing abilities to pick out the useful light energy it needs for life processes and even though the kelvin temperature may be equal, the light energy that provides this kelvin ""color"" is not. The point of these comparisons is you simply cannot compare apples to oranges when it comes a high wattage of T12 cool white lamps versus targeted T5 (or T2) as well as the ""cheapie"" LED panels with high wattage versus high end LED such as theAquaRay. In fact even with the ""high end"" LEDs by TMC, the Reef White 1000 Ultra produces a higher PAR than the TMC 1500 XG Ultima, yet the 1500 XG (9000k) produces more PUR at depths 12 inches or less!<query> what is the difference between reef white and reef white</query> Back To Top 6: LUMENS: The international unit of luminous flux or quantity of light used as a measure of the total amount of visible light emitted. The higher the lumens, the ""brighter"" or more ""intense"" the light looks to the human eye. You can figure lumens per watt by dividing the lumens your lamp lists by the wattage the fixture lists. Knowing your lumens per watt is often as or more important than watts per gallon. For example a T12 light that is rated at 20 watts with a total lumen output of 800 lumens has a lumen per watt output of 40. While a13 watt T2 bulb rated at 950 lumens has a lumen output of 73 lumens per watt. This is a clear example that the watts per gallon rule is severely flawed as the 13 watt T2 (or two of these) is clearly the better choice for a 15 gallon planted aquarium (or reef) and this does not even take into consideration the PAR rating which is also important for plants/corals or lumens per length of bulb (space).<query> how many lumens per watt</query> This lumen comparison also applies toSHO, VHO, and Metal Halide all of which far out produce most T12 lamps in lumens per watt. Focused Lumens; It is also noteworthy that even the lumen output can be deceiving when considering aquarium lights;LED are a good example of this as these newer technology lights have extremely focused light energy with little essential light energy lost (such as by Restrike), unlike almost every other type of aquarium light currently available. With this focused energy a LED often requires half the lumens (or often even less) to provide essential light energy (such as PAR) to plants, corals, etc. The newer generation LED lights have considerable less loss of lumens at 20 inches than a CFL light (as per tests that show 166% more lumens for the same wattage LED as compared to a common CFL of equal wattage).<query> what is the difference between led and cfl</query> As another example, think lasers, although not nearly as focused as a laser, modern LED emitters (such as the Aqua Ray) are much more focused than other types of commonly used aquarium lights. Caution as to using Lumens as a useful measurement of Light Output: While lumens are a important useful measurement for standard household light bulb comparison, it is only a part of the equation for aquarium use, especially when this measurement is applied to new technology lights employed by aquarium keepers (such as LEDs). As an example of just one aspect where the lumen measurement falls short is when Kelvin is considered; a bulb emitting 1000 lumens at a color temperature of 20,000K will not emit as much PAR as a bulb emitting 1000 lumens at 6500K. More over, when compared to ""Useful Light Energy"" (PUR), Lumen output falls well short as useful comparison of light output.<query> what is the lumens of a led aquarium light bulb</query> This said, I am not saying Lumen output and focused lumens are useless, as these parameters are a piece of the light parameter ""pie"", but often it is overrated and these parameters should only be taken as a part and a small part at that when compared to PAR and especially PUR. Back To Top 7: WATTS: Watts equal one joule of energy per second. For us, it's a measurement of how much energy our light fixture is using NOT of light output! This why the 3-4 watts per gallon for FW plants (3-5) for reef can be deceiving, and this rule is only a starting point similar to the 1 inch of fish per gallon ""rule"". This archaic rule was more accurate when all that was used were T12 lamps which is what this rules is based on.<query> what is the difference between watts and lumens</query> Keeping this in mind the average T12 has a lumens per watt rating of 40, which means you would need half as many watts of a bulb that produces 80 lumens per watt (assuming PAR, Kelvin and other aspects are equal) The term ""watts per gallon"" is getting more archaic as newer T-2, T-5, compact Fluorescents, the SHO, and especially the new reef compatible LED lights. Keeping this in mind; 'watts', when applied to a standard fluorescent tube are spread over longer bulbs as the wattage increases. For instance a standard 30 watt T 8 bulb is 36"" while a standard 20 watt T-8 bulb is 24"". For high light requirements such as plants or reefs, at least 1 inch per watt is required when comparing tube style fluorescent bulbs. Many high output light such as the Metal Halide or the more economicalSHO PC bulbs use a lot of 'watts' in a small amount of space.<query> how many watts are in a fluorescent bulb</query> The 110 watt SHO bulb uses 110 watts in 10"" or even less if mounted in a pendant. Another aspect of watts is the output of lumens per watts actually used. As a comparison when lumens are considered; the actual output of a 400 watt incandescent bulb is about 25 watts of light, a 400 watt metal halide bulb emits about 140 watts of light. If PAR is considered to correspond more or less to the visible region, then a 400 watt metal halide lamp provides about 140 watts of PAR. A 400 watt HPS lamps has less PAR, typically 120 to 128 watts, but because the light is yellow it is rated at higher lumens (for the human eye). Wattage of lights versus PUR is where the actual watts used when comparing one light to another is simply not at all accurate, such as comparing a MH or LED of say 75 watts to T12 cool white Fluorescents also of 75 watts; these cool white T12s will simply not even be close to ""useful light energy"" output at 75 watts as the LEDs or MH (of coarse other factors apply to the MH and LED as not all are equal here as well).<query> how many watts is a 400 watt bulb</query> What I am trying to say is sometimes it comes down to comparing apples to oranges. Other aquarium lighting considerations besides energy used (watts) are PUR, PAR, Lumens per watt and even output relative to the size of the light. For example a SHO that uses 105 watts yet is only 10"" and placed into a reflector will be very efficient as per wattage and space utilized for this. Another example is aT-2 bulb that only takes up a small space (7 mm diameter) can be a very productive bulb as per lumens per watt (73 lumens per watt!), PAR and space used. For example I would recommend a pair of 19 inch/13 watt/ 6400K T-2 lights over a pair of 20 inch/15 watt standard (T8 or T12) for a 20 gallon planted tank; the reasons are higher lumens per watt (73 vs. 40-50) and correct temperature/PAR (6400 K vs. 2100 -4500).<query> what is the wattage of a aquarium light bulb</query> The bottom line is 'watts per gallon' can be used when comparisons are ""apples to apples"" such as one Patented High output LED emitter to another, but not when comparing a T8, to a T5 to a T2 , to a Metal Halide and especially to an LED. An example of an ""apples to apples"" comparison would be the Patented emitters used by TMC require .8 watt per gallon (or less) under 24 inches of water for high light requiring reef life (.6 watt per gallon or less for planted freshwater aquariums). 8: CRI: To help indicate how colors will appear under different light sources, a system was devised some years ago that mathematically compares how a light source shifts the location of eight specified pastel colors on a version of the C.I.E. color space as compared to the same colors lighted by a reference source of the same Color Temperature.<query> how many watts per gallon for a led</query> If there is no change in appearance, the source in question is given a CRI of 100 by definition. From 2000K to 5000K, the reference source is the Black Body Radiator and above 5000K, it is an agreed upon form of daylight. A CRI of 100 has a heavy red spectrum. The color temperature is 2700 K for incandescent light and 3000 K for halogen light. An incandescent lamp, virtually by definition, has a Color Rendering Index (CRI) close to 100. This does not mean that an incandescent lamp is a perfect color rendering light source. It is not. It is very weak in blue, as anyone who has tried to sort out navy blues, royal blues and black under low levels of incandescent lighting. On the other hand, outdoor north sky daylight at 7500K is weak in red, so it isn't a ""perfect"" color rendering source either.<query> what is the color rendering index of an incandescent light bulb</query> Yet, it also has a CRI of 100 by definition. CRI is useful in specifying color if it is used within its limitations. Originally, CRI was developed to compare continuous spectrum sources whose CRI's were above 90 because below 90 it is possible to have two sources with the same CRI, but which render color very differently. At the same time, the colors lighted by sources whose CRI's differ by 5 points or more may look the same. Colors viewed under sources with line spectra such as mercury, GE Multi-Vapor® metal halide or Lucalox® high pressure sodium lamps, may actually look better than their CRI would indicate. However, some exotic fluorescent lamp colors may have very high CRI's, while substantially distorting some particular object color. Technically, CRI's can only be compared for sources that have the same Color Temperatures.<query> what is the cri for fluorescent light</query> However, as a general rule ""The Higher The Better""; light sources with high (80-100) CRI's tend to make people and things look better than light sources with lower CRI's. Why use CRI if it has so many drawbacks? It's the only internationally agreed upon color rendering system that provides some guidance. It will be used until the scientific community can develop a better system to describe what we really see. It is an indicator of the relative color rendering ability of a source and should only be used as such (Source:Color Rendering) To be blunt, CRI is NOT a parameter that is important in determining the best aquarium light, but it is included here since many mistakenly tend to consider it an important parameter, in fact most lights sold with CRI ratings prominently displayed are intended for home or industrial use, NOT aquariums!<query> what is the cri rating for aquarium lights</query> Back To Top AQUARIUM BULB TYPE: Aquarium Light Types Explained Here Include: • T8 & T12, • T5, • T2 • VHO, • CFL, • SHO • Metal Halide, •LED, •Lunar • Induction, • HID Xenon *T-12; A standard pin, 1-1/2"" wide bulb. The main caution to the use of these bulbs for aquariums, even though many forums often suggest this, is the use of shop lights as an inexpensive alternative to many aquarium lights. A 4100 K cool white shop light is not going to come close to a 6400 K daylight lamp that is of peak PAR efficiency (even if you match lumens).<query> types of aquarium lights</query> This bulb will generally use more watts and have a lower lumens per watt ratio (usually around 40) and is common in shop lights and even many aquarium bulbs. These are generally the least expensive lamps to purchase and even though they may be ""old school"", some still try to make up for the low technology with the fact you can purchase several for a low price to make up for poor efficiency. *T-8; A standard pin, 1"" wide bulb. As compared to the T-12, a 48"" T-12 will use 40 watts, while a 48"" T-8 will often use 32 watts (although not always). Even though the watts are higher on the T-12 the T-8 is more efficient with less wattage. The T-8 is the more common bulb/lamp size in many basic aquarium lights.<query> what is the wattage of a aquarium light bulb</query> *T-5; Generally around 13 mm in diameter. This is a mini pin bulb which generally uses even less watts per lumen than many than T-8 bulbs. A common lumens per watt output for T-5 lamps is around 65. The T5 has become very popular among both plant keeping freshwater aquarists and reef keepers for good reasons; they are compact, come in many varieties and high lumen per watt outputs (as a broad generalization only requiring 2 to 4 watts per gallon for more shallow planted/reef applications depending upon tank depth and other factors). As with T2 Lights, T5 are generally not well suited for deeper tanks over 20 inches • One negative with T5s is that the quality control on these lighting fixtures (not the bulbs themselves) is often lacking. This problem tends to be withsome of the HO (or VHO) T5 light ballasts/fixtures, and in fact tends to be a problem with VHO Compact Light Fixtures as well.<query> what is the lumens per watt for a t5 light</query> For this reason my recommendation is to avoid the VHO or HO T5 or Power Compact CFLs and stick with the standard output versions. If higher output is needed consider the newer technology SHO, LED or MH lights instead, in fact when cost per lumen as per lifespan is considered, aLED Aquarium Light Fixture is now a much better deal (since LEDs last 50,000 hours vs. the common 8000 lifespan of a HO T5 or VHO Power Compact). Another consideration for higher output requirements, such as large planted freshwater aquariums, consider the vastly superior in terms of performance and cost SHO light over the T5 (the T5 is a good light, but it is often pushed by aquarium keepers that are not aware that technology has passed them by). Back To Top *T-2; These bulbs are the latest fluorescent technology yet (LED are advancing even more).<query> what is the difference between a vho light and a ho light They measure only 7 mm and allow for several bulbs in a small space. A 13 watt 20 inch T-2 Bulb (6400 K) produces 950 lumens which is 73 lumens per watt in a very small space with low wasted green/yellow light energy that is often found in other Power Compact Lights! As little as 1 to 1.50 watts per gallon for a planted aquarium is all that is needed from these T2 Lights! (depending upon tank depth, and not for tanks over 20 inches max; consider SHO for tanks over 18 inches). Quite bluntly, these T2 lamps and fixtures are about the best bulbs in a small space I have seen! These are very useful for small to medium planted aquariums or Nano Reefs or even shelves for betta breeders (although ONLY as a compliment in larger aquariums over 20 inches in depth for freshwater and 16 inches for marine).<query> how many lumens in a t2 light</query> The linkable fixture feature (although some T5s also have this neat feature) is also a nice aspect of these T2 lights/fixtures (this allows for use in larger aquaria such as 60 gallons PLUS). Some T2s can be linked with small extensions (that are available with these T2 fixtures), these allow you the choice of either placing a T2 in series (end to end) or in parallel (which is useful if you desire a higher output yet in a small space or to utilize a daylight and blue/actinic light parallel to each other) with out having to add multiple outlets/plugs. The newest generation T2 Lights require less watts to provide the same useful light energy (in particular required by plants & coral) than all other lights except for LED. Speaking of LED Lights, the T2 makes an excellent compliment to LED Lights (for cost savings as well).<query> what is t2 light</query> The actual useful energy output of this comparison would be a minimum of 50% more useful energy for roughly the same wattage and same length of lamps Water penetration is another consideration, as higher frequency ""red"" light energy is quickly filtered out in water, and many light energy requiring plants, corals, etc. have adapted to light energies found at certain depths of water. This overview is just an brief explanation, please read further for more in depth discussion (and I do not assume this article is the end all of aquarium lighting discussion, I will add a lot more as time goes on as newer information that explains or corrects the subjects contained in this article better). It is important to note that Aquarium Lighting is complex subject, and this article has both more depth information as well as some basics (in the summary recommendations), however this is a subject that simply reading one section of this article will yield incomplete information.<query> what is the useful energy output of aquarium lighting</query> The picture to the left displays a newly set up planted freshwater tank that has 4GroBeam 500 LED and 4 6400K T2s as well as a Mylar Reflector (there are many locations sellingMylar including online). (Please Click the picture to enlarge) When all important parameters are considered (PAR, useful energy, lumens per watt, etc.) the a typical 6400K T2 about 40% of the wattage of a standard T8/T12 aquarium light for the same useful output (a 13 watt T2 will equal 30 watts of most older fluorescent aquarium lights). The T2 will even exceed a comparable T5 light by about 20% in useful light energy output in up to 20 inches of water. I expect these new T-2 lamps to sweep the small to medium aquarium keeping hobby (especially planted FW and Nano reef) due to their extremely high efficiency and out put.<query> how many watts in a t2 aquarium light</query> (only LED lights are more efficient, please click on the picture to the left for a comparison). In fact these lamps are even a good choice for many aquariums such as 60 gallons and larger since each fixture can be linked together forming a larger fixture (similar to some T5 fixtures, which are also good fixtures, just not quite up to the more modern T2 in efficiency vs. output). For instance I have used two T2s linked together for some 60 gallon FW aquarium and two sets of two (placed in parallel in the hood) for planted 60 gallon FW aquariums. T2 Fixtures/lights also work well in Marine Aquariums (particularly pico/nano reef) since these lamps in the 6400 K version have a high output in PAR required for symbiotic algae that live within corals. As wellactinic/blue versions of the T2 light are now available to the consumer.<query> what is t2 aquarium light</query> One negative with the first generation T2 as compared to the older T5 is that there are not the selection/variety, however as noted in the previous paragraph, blue/actinic T2 lights are now available to the hobby. As well, there is not as much need for some of the versatility other lights, as the T2 has its own versatility such as small space combined with higher lumen per watt output. I would also counter uninformed aquatic forum comments such as this one:""T2 are still pretty much a niche market that could be easily overwhelmed by the T5 and they could disappear at any time or just become even more expensive"". The answer is both yes and no. The T5 at one time was still a niche market as well, and more importantly the T2 has grown considerably popularity in Asia (possible due to space concerns) and even in small scale Hydroponics/home green house applications in North America.<query> are t2 lights niche</query> Statements like that are why the aquarium industry is often a decade behind other industries in adapting new technologies (if at all in some sad occasions). One other negative with first generation T2s that goes for T5s (especially the expensive HO version of T5) is that the quality control on these lighting fixtures (not the bulbs themselves) is often lacking. From my investigation of looking at defective items, it seems to be difficulties in good solder in the confined spaces of these small micro lighting fixtures. This problem seems to be a first generation problem of T2, as the newer (second generation) T2s we are now using do not seem to have this problem with early tests. As well the problem of short ballast lifespan does not exist as it does with the VHO version of T5 lights, but then a VHO version of the T2 does not exist.<query> what is the problem with t2 bulbs</query> Back To Top *VHO Power Compact This stands for ""Very High Output"". These come in T-5 thru T-12 standard fluorescent tubes and in the newer power compact (usually 4 pin) lamps such as the popular Current USA, Coralife Quad &New generation Via Aqua Helios VHO. The new Helios & other VHO Power Compact Fixtures come in a variety of sizes with outputs up to 180 watts out of lamps under 40 inches in length, which rival many Metal Halide (although not in depth penetration). These new higher output VHO fixtures/lamps have higher Kelvin and wattage output than previous generation VHO lamps/fixtures of similar size. These can be used for both marine reef applications as well as freshwater planted aquariums (these new VHOs are not scheduled for full release to the public until early 2009).<query> what is vho power compact</query> Coralife has a new quad lamp VHO (such as the 20 inch; 96 watt fixture) that have high output in small space. However both these before mentioned lighting systems are a bit pricey in my opinion for the ""light out"" for the price paid. As well the electronic ballasts contained in not just these, but ALL these VHO styles of CFL light fixtures (Current USA, JBJ, etc.) tend to have a short life span of under 3-5 years in my experience. When the ballasts go out, generally the replacement cost is the same as a new fixture. With this in mind, I would recommend theSHO Lights which only require an inexpensive incandescent fixture and are vastly less expensive the similar high output PAR light (for example: $35.99 for a 105 watt SHO).<query> how long does it take for a vho light fixture to go out</query> I should also note that as of my latest update of this section (VHO), I have found their durability in relation to cost, and output in essential lighting parameters (not just the way out of date watts per gallon so called rule) is not as good as the up and coming SHO or especiallyLED Lights, which in my tests, feedback, research and experience are the future of aquarium lighting, especially as it pertains to freshwater plant and reef aquariums. More bluntly, I would generally advice aquarium keepers to avoid the often over hyped VHO Power Compacts or HO T5 in lieu of the SHO, LED, or Metal Halide for high end lighting needs or stick standard CFL orT2 Aquarium Lights for cost effective aquatic lighting needs. Back To Top *PC (or CFL); This stands for ""Power Compact"" or ""Compact Fluorescent Lamp (light)"".<query> what is the best aquarium light</query> These bulbs come in straight pin arrangements, square pin arrangements, and the self ballasted standard incandescent fixture ""screw in"" type. These bulbs are similar to T-5s and have about the same lumen per watt output (generally around 60 lumens per watt). The standard medium base version of these lamps will fit in a common incandescent light fixture, making these lights about the most economical lights you can purchase with this kind of output. These are an excellent choice for use in planted Freshwater or even Marine. These can be used in a basic Nano Reef tank under 30 gallons, especially when the hood already contains incandescent fixtures, as you need not purchase special fixtures for these. See the picture to the left as an example, please click to enlarge These self ballasted high PAR lamps are inexpensive and make it easy for even an aquarist on a budget (even a freshwater fish only tank) to provide the best possible lighting within a budget for fish, plant, and even basic Nano reef health!<query> what kind of light bulb for reef tank</query> Back To Top *SHO Power Compact Lights: A newer Power Compact that in my opinion is awesome for planted aquariums (in fact the best other than some high end LEDs for planted freshwater aquariums). As well the SHO can be used for reef aquariums (as an addition to LED or Metal Halide) The SHO Light is currently sold in a self ballasted PC bulbs/light. The 105 Watt SHO Daylight bulb puts out 6300 lumens and is comparable to a 525 watt Standard bulb (click on the picture for a link). This comes out to 60 lumens per watt; however this is a deceptive guide, as you can fit many more of these bulbs in a given space and also utilize more efficient reflectors. The SHO is already VERY popular with Green Houses/hydroponics and is growing in aquarium use popularity, although it is still relatively unknown to many in the aquarium hobby (although many forward thinking planted FW and some reef keepers are aware of these lights now ).<query> what is the difference between a light bulb and a light bulb</query> In fact the 105 Watt SHOs were in short supply during the spring of 2009 due to just one company purchasing 1000 of these for lighting greenhouses. My point is; if a company (greenhouse business) that needs the correct lighting that are price effective to grow plants for a business, all the more reason these should be used in many freshwater plant aquarium applications (& even many reef tanks as well due to high PAR and output needed by zooxanthellae living within corals, complimented by actinic LEDs or MHs). Keep in mind that there is vastly more research $$$ into horticulture than into aquarium keeping (the money generated by the aquarium industry is just a needle in the haystack compared to most other industries), sadly this point is missed while many continue to use older less efficient, yet often more expensive lighting technology for their planted aquariums.<query> what kind of lighting is used in aquariums</query> For this reason I recommend reading the whole article (as well as links provided) for a more thorough understanding (it may take more than one reading as well) I should also note that while I have years of hands on experience (over 30+), this is a fast evolving subject of aquarium keeping requiring my constant research and consulting with others (who often have more scientific expertise than myself); the result is constant changes to this article. The five most important criteria in determining the light you need are: • Lumens per watt • Lumen focus (as well as restrike) • PAR (this is important to understand) • PUR/Useful Light Energy (Probably the most important factor; this is related to PAR, however many lamps can have reasonable PAR output but fail in comparison when PUR is considered).<query> what is the most important factor in aquarium lighting</query> In fact the medical community is now utilizing these SHO bulbs (& similar full spectrum lights, which is also often making the SHO in short supply) due to increasing studies that show better immune function, mental health, and more. Similar animal studies show like results. I learned of this when inquiring as to why the SHO lights were currently unavailable from the North American distributor, and they pointed out that several hospitals and convalescent homes had purchased over 1500 of these lights. They pointed out the simplicity of these Super High Output bulbs are quickly making these a favorite of the medical community for their full spectrum light needs (I now use a few 65 Watt 6400K SHOs in my home after learning this and there is certainly a difference). See these references: *New Science Sheds Light on Immune Deficiencies *Light as a Nutrient While there are few drawbacks to the SHO light for aquarium use; one such drawback is that in any ""tube light"" some of the light that shines up from each tube just reflects right back into the tube and is lost (this is called ""Restrike"").<query> what is the difference between sho and strobe light</query> HOWEVER, the spiral design & especially the use of a reflector tends to limit this minor problem and based on extreme plant growth achieved this is obviously not as much a factor as some may claim (this is essentially a problem with ALL compact Fluorescent lights). As well, while the SHO does not produce nearly as much heat as a Metal Halide, the simple fact of the wattage used by these lights still produces heat, so a well vented hood or the use of a reflector is advised ( any light should be placed in a ventilated hood/canopy as trapped moisture can quickly damage any light whether an SHO, T5 or LED). Finally the only other potential negative is that these SHO lights are more of a DIY lighting application, not an out of the box and place on your aquarium light applications; so those who do not have DIY abilities, time, or simply desire an out of the box light might find this is not the light for them.<query> what is the difference between a fluorescent light and a soo light</query> Back to the positives of Super High Output lights; quite bluntly there are few equals for high output aquarium lighting (especially forplanted freshwater aquariums), especially when cost is considered (as well as other positives) since these lamps do not require expensive ballasts like a MH (SHO are self ballasted) and generally cost $30 and up per lamp. Since the 6400K SHO requires as little as 2 to 2.5 watts per gallon for the most light demanding plants; Four 85 watt SHOs (or 105 watt for even higher output) can easily handle a 6 foot FW 125 gallon planted aquarium (some T2 or T5 can fill in some more dim spots if necessary) While in Marine Reef Aquariums this same combination (maybe using 105 watt SHOs) along with one or twoLED Lights (such as TMC Marine Blue) would work in most reef applications for $500 to $800 for a large aquarium (less for smaller aquariums, or in combination with LED).<query> how much does a aquarium light cost</query> Consider the 65 Watt SHO for smaller tanks of depths under 15 inches. The SHO can be mounted into your hood using a standard incandescent fixture. I recommend using an aluminum foil or better an easily made mylar reflector to amplify light downward (& reflect heat away from the canopy). I also recommend venting the hood to remove heat and moisture (a small outward direction fan can be helpful too) The SHO light is most effective hung as a pendant light using reflector similar to how Metal Halides are commonly installed over an open aquarium. These SHO lamps are also an excellent compliment to MH, VHO or other ""strip"" lamps for use in reef tanks (in part due to their high intensity in small space and PAR output which is important for the symbiotic coral/algae relationship). Research (albeit older research now) has shown that many stony corals, clams, and other sessile species that depend on photosynthesis of zooanthellic algae not only thrive but also propagate when maintained under Power Compact lighting alone, and the SHO power compact has a MUCH higher useful light output over standard CFL.<query> what is the difference between a sho and a vho light</query> The picture to the left shows one way of DIY mounting of a SHO light with a reflector by designing your own ""rail"" system that fits on the aquarium top. Multiple SHO Lights can be added with just such a mounting system This tank shows just one of many simple ways to install a SHO light which also includes hanging pendent style, or inside of a canopy, but this picture shows my favorite method. Please click the picture to enlarge As of the most recent update of this section of the article, the SHO is easily one of the lights of the immediate future for aquarium lighting (the others are the quickly improvingLED aquatic light & T2 and some of the newer T5), in particular planted freshwater aquariums or some reef aquariums. This is not to say that MH or VHO are bad, it is just when you consider all the aspects of aquarium lighting parameters (not just the out of date watts per gallon rule), then throw in costs of purchase, reliability (a problem with many VHO & some T5 lights) lower heat output (the main issue with MH); there is simply little comparison at this time.<query> what is sho light</query> In summary as to SHO lights for aquarium use, what I find amusing is that the only negative comment I have had from someone whoactually used an SHO in his 30 Hexagon is that his plants grew TOO FAST with constant pearling and he could not keep up with them due to his work schedule. Honestly this negative is positive proof of these lamps abilities! In fact, even with quickly improving LEDs (see later in this article), the SHO may still be your best choice when price is considered (it is still often the most popular choice for Hydroponics or Planted Aquariums). Back To Top *Metal Halide (MH); Metal Halide was generally considered the ""Kings"" of reef aquarium lighting due to depth penetration, output, spectrum, and over all beauty and amount of coral life they help support making most corals ""pop"" with life (however the newest HO LEDs are now over taking the MH and the keyword is ""was"").<query> what is the best aquarium light</query> Aesthetically speaking the Metal Halide is also hard to beat, however the latest technology LED lights are now beginning to surpass MH for Reefs and LEDs have been proven to surpass MH with plant growth in nursery/hydroponics environments (one study/test shows a 12 Watt Full spectrum LED producing better growth than a 175 Watt MH of the same type!). That said for tanks over 30 inches in specimen placement , the Metal Halide is still generally the best available light, especially when used in light combinations that include 20,000K, with other popular Metal Halide Kelvin Color Temperatures being 10,000K, and 14,000K (the 10,000K generally providing the best PUR for tanks under 20 inches in depth). As for other light comparisons to the MH, even the newer T-5 lamps cannot achieve the depth penetration and overall output of these lights.<query> what is the best light for reefs</query> Metal Halides generally have very good lumens per watt ratio (although I have seen a lot of variation and even incorrect ratings here); however it is safe to say that MH are generally found with lumens to watt ratios of 50 to as high as 90 which is among the highest of any aquarium lights available (along with excellent PAR production as well). Metal Halide work via a gas mixture of halides and other elements, the actual light production comes from the small bubble of gas that is held in place by metal wires and/or supports. The electricity running between them and the small gas bubble, heats them, similar to an incandescent filament. This is one of the reasons that Metal Halide bulbs give off more heat than other bulbs. MH Lights are generally sold in two basic types for aquarium use: the Mogul base & the HQI Double Ended Metal Halide bulbs.<query> what is the difference between a metal halide and a mh light</query> Mogul base screw in Metal Halide bulbs for Aquarium use come in a variety of color spectrum from 10K to 20K (the bluest)and wattages from 250W - 1000W. German made (Ushio) metal halides have an excellent reputation for producing the best lighting effects for reef aquariums. The newer Halogen Quartz Iodide (HQI) lighting systems are used mostly on saltwater reef aquariums. HQI bulbs are commonly offered with spectrums of 10,000K and 20,000K. These high-intensity bulbs help corals thrive, but give off less heat than regular metal halide bulbs. HQI Double Ended Metal Halide bulbs have been used in Europe for many years have gained popularity in the U.S. among aquarium hobbyists in the last several years. Double Ended MH HQI bulbs offer many of the same features as standard mogul base Metal Halide bulbs but are designed differently. These bulbs are much smaller than mogul base screw in Metal Halides and are double ended.<query> what is hqi bulbs</query> The benefits of using HQI Metal Halide bulbs are that they offer a more clean color spectrum (useful light energy/responsive wavelength), are more efficient, produce slightly less heat, and last longer than standard Mogul Base metal halide lamps. The downside is the heat that MH lights produce, often resulting in the need for hood fans and even chillers, although the newer open design units such as the EcoSystems USHIO double end fixture and HQI bulb works well for 10-25 (or even larger aquariums when other lights are included in the ""mix"") without a chiller. The sizes I most often have used are between 10,000K and the 14,000K with 75 watts for small aquariums up to 400 watts for really deep tanks (over 30""). With the 10,000K- 14,000K lamp what I currently recommend.<query> what is the difference between hqi and hqi bulbs</query> • Watts (or watts per gallon, however this term is over used/simplistic) However the above five aquarium lighting criteria is an over simplification, so an understanding as best possible of other aspects as well as the positives and negatives of each lighting type, including types that the often ""5-10 years behind technology aquarium industry"" ignore such as LED, SHO, T2, or Induction are important as well (as I see it from tests and research; the SHO, T2 and especially the LED are future of aquarium lighting, not the popular dual CFL & others). Here are other important factors; 1: KELVIN RATING (such as 10,000K daylight bulb): What is meant with Kelvin Temperature of Lights is not the classic interpretation of what Kelvin is, however I think is should be considered before I move on to our lighting definition of ""Kelvin Temperature"".<query> what is the kelvin rating for aquarium lights</query> Back To Top *LED (light-emitting diode): Quickly becoming the new king of aquarium lighting (at least with the new ""high end"" HO/PUR LED emitter bins), with the same shimmering effect and ""popping"" of coral life otherwise found in Metal Halide. This aquarium light type uses semiconductor technology as its light source. The difficulty in the past (and where many still misunderstand the complexities of LEDs) is correct wave length of the emitters. Achieving the correct wavelengths in the correct amounts has been the challenge and why a simple LED flashlight has about as much in common to an advanced aquarium LED as a paper glider to an 747 jet airplane. This however is also the advantage as much of the useless green and yellow light spectrums can be omitted as well. Another challenge has been the sophisticated circuitry required to control voltage for delicate high end emitters from spikes or drops in voltage.<query> what is led aquarium light</query> As well new power supplies (ballasts/drivers) are in development that can add 10% more output from the same LED emitter. The new reef compatible & freshwater planted tank LED's are likely to take over the market along with the T2, T5, & SHO lights as the better LED fixtures become more readily available, the price comes down, PUR (useful light energy) & general aquarium compatibility come up. Correct emitter PUR/Kelvin technology has been a barrier in the past and continues to be the problem with the plethora of LED fixtures made in the same factories using the same lower technology under multiple brand names and sold at most aquarium stores. In addition these lights do not have the heat problems, often last 50,000 hours, produce less useless yellow/green spectrum light (in aquarium adjusted configurations), and are very compact.<query> what is the difference between led aquarium lights and led aquarium lights</query> In fact this lack of production of yellow/green light in many all 'high end' emitters used by various LED Kelvin lights (whether 6500K or 14000K) often makes the LED look less bright to the human eye, when in fact the opposite is true as per useful light energy. High end LED lights that utilize the proper Nanometer output emitter bins may prove to be more suitable for aquatic life tank-lighting and reef tanks because they offer superior flexibility when compared with traditional fluorescent lighting & even Metal Halide. When LED lights operate, the photometric radiation remains within a narrow band on the electromagnetic spectrum. Specific photometric wavelengths are often beneficial to some aquatic plant life and reef tanks. Controlling specific wavelengths becomes possible through a basic network of colored LED lights connected digital LED controllers, circuitry, and drivers.<query> what wavelengths do led lights emit</query> It is in this area where development costs are incurred and where many who do not understand the business aspects of these costs will questionwhy one LED manufacture has or can have exclusive patent rights or similar. Basically any 'high end' developer is going to want to recover development costs as quickly as possible and ""off the shelf"" sales is NOT the way to do this; AND TMC, CRee, OSRAM, Orphek, etc. are no different than any other manufacturers in other businesses. As an example; Drug manufacturers are similar in development costs, as while not all research and development results in a ""winner"", the projects that do ""pan out"" have to pay off and you are certainly not going to find the latest heart medication in a generic package, YET based on a few questions I have received, some persons think this does not apply to LED emitters and similar?<query> what is the difference between a drug manufacturer and a led manufacturer</query> Since LEDs emit light only in very specific direction, the installer has the option to illuminate a precise area by simply rotating the polycarbonate tube casing. For this reason the LED does not need to produce as many lumens of light as most conventional lights as many lumens of important light energy is lost due to lack of focus, including all power compacts and fluorescent lights in general, but need higher lumen outputs to achieve the same lighting parameters. Controlled Tests with Plants and The Aquatic Life Implications; In tests for plant nurseries (Green House, Hydroponics) full spectrum LEDs such as the newer generationTMC GroBeam Aquarium Lights, 3w LED Grow Lights or even the older generation LED Grow Lights have been proven to surpass even Metal Halide Lights in both growth and useful output. The picture to the left are the plant growth results comparing the same Kelvin output LED and Metal Halide Lights as measured by a PAR Meter (please click to enlarge view): It is noteworthy that the human eye is very sensitive to light in the yellow and green regions (500-600 nm).<query> what is the difference between led grow lights and led led aquarium lights</query> This graph shows the relative spectral intensity of 2nd generation (not the newest emitters) LED 6500K and a typical HID-MH grow light (6500K), together with the human eye response curve as measured by a PAR meter (for the light output, not the human eye response). This graph also shows why a high performance LED light (of any Kelvin) may not appear as bright to the human eye). This controlled test has aquatic implications, as photosynthesis is the same whether it be a terrestrial plant, a freshwater aquatic plant, or symbiotic zooanthellic algae found in corals. The only difference would be that light energy is quickly absorbed by water, especially red light waves and many MH (such as a 14,000K or 20,000) have excellent depth penetration, however modern LED lights such as an AquaRay/AquaBeam 600 Marine Blue have similar penetration.<query> what is the difference between led and led light</query> It is still easy to make assumptions from the raw data based on this study with plants that a 12 Watt High Output LED (such as theMini 400 or GroBeam 500 for planted aquariums or the AquaBeam 600 Reef White/Marine Blue for Marine Reef Aquariums) can at least replace a 100 watt MH of equal Kelvin ratings in reef or planted aquarium applications (theTMC AquaBeam Ultra 1000; 30 Watt LED should easily replace one 175 Watt Metal Halide, if not a 250 watt MH of similar rating for marine applications). Please click on the picture above/left for a better view of a 40 gallon freshwater aquarium with just ONE GroBeam 500 12 Watt LED as an example of what just 12 watts of high end emitter LED light can do! Or click on the video below for a reef aquarium with only three AquaBeam Reef White 500/600 12 watt LED Strips: YouTube Video, Red sea max 130 after aquaray mod<query> what is the best led light for reefs</query> Back to the Controlled Tests with Plants: The picture to the left shows the useful PAR light energy of a MH compared to a LED Light (both full spectrum daylight). Please note that this is anolder generation ""Full Spectrum Daylight"" LED used in this controlled test,not the newest generation GroBeam or higher Kelvin Marine White 14000K. Legend *Dark Blue = LED Lights (6500K) *Light Blue = Necessary PAR Spectrum of Chlorophyll *Lavender = Metal Halide (6500K). There are mixed reviews on the older generation larger units such as the Solaris (which is basically the first generation of LED aquarium lights & quite pricey at that) and earlier TMC LEDs as well when compared to MH light fixtures, I personally did not find LEDs practical for Reef or Planted Aquarium Lighting until 2008.<query> what is the par spectrum of led lights</query> However the newer 3rd generation and lower cost TMC Aqua Ray are a vast improvement in price/affordability and PUR output; in fact at the price of theAquaRay LED Aquarium Light Strip, coupled with the 50,000 hour lifespan their actual light cost per hour for comparable output is actually favorable to most available aquarium lights. More about Emitters: Many do not seem to understand that not all emitters are equal even with the open source Cree-XR-E emitters, commonly sold for other applications; these are only as good as their correct wavelength output (Kelvin Temperature/Nanometers). One cannot compare a first generation CREE XR-E or similar emitter from a few years back to the newest XR-E of today anymore than you can compare first generation iPhone to the latest iPhone (same name, improved technology).<query> what is the cost of aquaray</query> Based on email I get (some very insulting too), forums I have read, & especially YouTube videos (for DIY LED Aquarium Lights) many persons seem to make this very incorrect assumption. This has resulted in a plethora of non reef capable LED lights flooding the market, some claiming to use CRee daylight emitters while in reality these are not even close to the same currently patented emitters used by high end LED lights! I do not know whether to laugh or cry when I read or watch YouTube videos where someone brags how cheaply that they put together a DIY LED Fixture, when in reality this is the same as bragging about making your own PC Computer using a circa 2000 Intel processor and attempting to compare it to a computer using the latest Intel processor! Since ""Blue"" light is the easiest to achieve with low end LEDs, this is way to often spot poor quality LEDs (as well as ""cool white""), as with common household LED light replacements, these will appear more blue than high end daylight LED emitters.<query> what kind of led lights do you use for aquarium lights</query> Here is a brief description of Kelvin: Kelvin is defined by two points: absolute zero, and the triple point of pure water. Absolute zero is defined as being precisely 0 K and –273.15 °C. Absolute zero is where all kinetic energy (motion) in the particles comprising matter ceases, and they are at complete rest. At absolute zero there is NO heat energy (the total absence of heat). The triple point of water is defined as being 273.16 K and 0.01 °C. Here are a few Kelvin numbers: *Absolute zero = 0 K (-273.15C) *Waters freezing point = 273.15 K (0 C) *Waters boiling point = 373.1339K (100C) The true definition of Kelvin is that it is a unit of measure of temperature on the thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale.<query> what is the triple point of water</query> Another example are the exclusive Cree Emitter bins used by Tropic Marine Center AquaRay/AquaBeam should not be confused with CRee emitters sold for other lighting applications, as these donot produce the correct Kelvin/Nanometers of Light energy required for delicate marine reef inhabitants and freshwater plants. One example is the Daylight CRee XR-E from several generations back that are available to the general public, Chinese manufacturers, and used by manufacturers such as Aqua Illumination, E.Shine, or others and sold under USA brand names (such as Marineland). This older generation emitter ranges from 6000 to 9000K (in the same emitter too!) and has much more of the green/yellow bands and much less of the near infrared bands of light. Another example is the blue emitter bin used by TMC produces a rather exact 465nm - 485nm (which as per our PAR section of this article is the primary UVA wavelength for optimum PAR).<query> what is the wavelength of a cree emitter</query> Worse would be the cheaper no name emitters used by manufacturers such as BaiSheng & others and sold under a plethora of other names for so-called aquarium use; these use daylight emitters that can vary from 2000K to 6500K and are in reality totally useless for aquarium use other than just plain light! Think about why a CFL 10,000K daylight is so much different and more expensive than a common household CFL sold in hardware stores, or the many decorative LED aquarium lights or even those for home or flashlight use; try using one of these to grow your delicate coral or plants (the answer is they will not). Sadly shortly before writing this update, I got a obscene email about why should he pay for a Cree emitter in a high end aquarium light such as the Aqua Ray or similar, when he could by these for much less money for other application.<query> what is the best aquarium light</query> This shows the unfortunate lack of understanding of what is important in aquarium lighting, whether LED or other lights (hopefully this is understood better for any reader here up to this point in the article). This is the reason mostearlier LED aquarium lights were not adequate for supporting life properly until recently. Another misunderstanding about LED emitters is targeting the responsive wavelength, while exact coral responsiveness wavelengths is unknown, much is known in a more broader sense (and even more knowledge is growing such as the ""blue band"" of coral responsiveness). As an example we do know that much of the yellow and green bands are useless. The unfortunate aspect of this misunderstanding is that these same misunderstandings do not seem to be applied to Metal Halides to which part of their success has been the targeting of responsive wavelengths rather than the ""shotgun"" approach of lighting in the past.<query> what is the responsive wavelength of coral</query> It is noteworthy that many other LED lights now on the market such as the Rio Mini Sun, Marineland Double Bright, or ""Ecoxotic Stunner"" areonly for adding highlights and supplemental lighting, not as a primary lighting source. This also is the case for the many submersible LED lights that are also available in stores or the internet (of which the circuitry generally fails due to humidity damage). The graph on the left shows the daylight emitter output of the popular Marineland Double Bright 1 Watt 6000K emitter ( please click on the picture to enlarge). This graph is very clear that there isnone of the essential near infrared spikes required for PAR/PUR, only blue and mostly wasted green/yellow visible light, this is what fools many who measure lights visually as the Double Bright will look bright to the human eye, but in reality is only a highlighting light (observed use in actual reef aquariums has proven this out too)!<query> what is marineland double bright</query> This is similar to the older (now out of date) TMC LED lights from a few years back, however the current TMC LEDs (such as the Marine White) now use the most current CRee emitter bins (with exclusive rights to these patents as noted earlier). The bottom line is the results of top notch emitters such as the patented Cree emitters speak for themselves by professional Reef Aquarium Maintenance companies, Quality Marine and others. There is a reason many LED knock offs utilize 100 plus emitters (often 1 watt each although the SkyLED is ONLY .06 watt per low PUR output emitter). These older technology LEDs use a shotgun approach to achieving aquarium lighting (similar in principle to my use of a dozen low end T12 fluorescent light tubes 30 years ago to achieve adequate lighting). A good example of this approach are the Acan Lighting LED lights.<query> what is the difference between a sky led and led light</query> For those interested in the best in LED technology, the TMC AquaRay as well as the Orphek and a few other truly high end LEDs are your best choices. Please note for those who choose to dig up old graphs and diagrams from TMCs website (which is not at all current), I already have provided the most current PAR readings, graphs, etc. and you can either accept or reject this information and the many aquarium keeping professionals that are using or have tested the LEDs I have spoken of. Comparing a TMC ""Marine White"" or ""Full Spectrum"" (which is not even sold any more) from a few years back to a latest CRee emitter bin ""Marine White"" is like comparing a cell phone circa 2000 to an iPhone circa 2011! Use of LED to prevent Red Slime Another positive attribute of LED Aquarium lights as per s recent study (August of 2009) is that LED used in marine aquariums that suffer withMarine Red Slime Algae (Cyanobacteria) can immediately eradicate Red Slime algae when used in a full spectrum lighting configuration.<query> what kind of led lights for aquariums</query> These ""immediate"" results were just two weeks. I do not know (as of this update) the exact reasons, but my suspicions is that CFL still produce more of the yellow/green nanometer range of light which encourages Cyanobacteria and discourages competing green algae. * PAR LED Lights are another newer innovation. These high PAR 6500K LED lights come in many different configurations of varying number of emitters. This LED was originally developed for the Hydroponics/ Plant Nursery Industry but has now crossed over for aquarium use. This LED produces very high amounts of useful lumens in the peak PAR with almost no wasted yellow or green light, making this an excellent and more economical choice for planted freshwater aquariums (& even marine aquariums too, especially those under 24 inches). This light is very focused with little spread, making it ideal for intense bright spots, but less than ideal for lighting vast areas of an aquarium.<query> what is the par of led lights</query> The other unique feature is this light is simple to install via a common household incandescent fixture. The picture above/left shows a PAR 38 6500K Daylight over half of a 40 gallon aquarium, demonstrating the high lighting capabilities of this more affordable, yet high output LED. *LED Summary; The bottom line is when you compare an LED Aquarium light to the many popular CFLs and even T5s in terms of lumens per watt, focused lumens, PAR/PUR, lower wasted yellow/green light energy, low heat output, energy consumption, long life (50,000 hours vs. 8000 hours), the modern LED is generally a better light even in long term cost since (as an example) a 12 Watt Aqua Ray GroBeam 6500K daylight (either #500 Strip or Mini #400 Tile) can easily replace a up to a 80 Watt power compact (also daylight) when you compare ALL aspects of lighting as presented in this article.<query> what is the best led aquarium light</query> When compared to even older T8/T12 aquarium lights, a third generation TMC Aqua Ray & OtherHigh End LEDs require only 15% (or less) of the wattage for the required light energy of a planted or reef aquarium (as little as .6 watt per gallon for high light planted aquariums and .8 watt per gallon for Reef). The flaws of LED aquarium lights are quickly disappearing and based on the energy savings in electricity in wattage of the lights (as compared to MH) as well as electricity use for air conditioning or the cost of a chiller often necessitated by larger Metal Halides. I should also note that LED light technology is growing by ""leaps and bounds"" and many of the bugs including price are currently being improved upon. In fact for Planted Freshwater the top LED Lights (with the highest PUR) have few limits in their applications.<query> how much wattage does a aquarium light need</query> While with Reef Aquariums even most of the best LED fixtures still are at their limits at 24-30 inches of water depth for delicate specimen placement LED Light systems are easily complimented with T5 Fixtures,T2 fixtures for smaller applications, or even the SHO self ballasted high output CFL for large tank applications (please note that the SHO are currently only available in daylight bulbs). See this video for an aquarium with three TMC Reef White LEDs & two CFL lamps: Reef Aquarium with Reef White 500/600 LED Finally;, I should note to newer readers of this constantly evolving article that may think there is bias toward high end LED lights, you would only be 1/4 correct, as first I do not recommend the plethora of junk LEDs commonly sold and as well if you were to read this same article circa 2007, I did not recommend ANY LED Light, including the TMC AquaRay, however technology had increased considerably in this arena of aquarium lighting.<query> what is the best aquarium light</query>"

I have never seen my plants pearl as much as they do now, and I went from about 185 watts of HO t5s to 170 watt CFLs. I would consider these a serious upgrade!!!! Mark T. SHO MOUNTING SUGGESTIONS Please click on pictures below to enlarge Since the SHO lamps/bulbs are larger than most incandescent or CFL lamps, they will not readily fit in a small plastic aquarium hood (a T2 or CFL will), however considering the output in both light and temperature (not as much temperature as a MH by any means), they are best either hung over an aquarium using the pendant we sell or a simple clip on Incandescent Fixture which can be purchased almost anywhere for low cost.<query> what is the difference between a cfl and a sho light</query> The picture to the above shows how the SHO bulb properly attaches to the polished reflector and standard incandescent fixture. Please note that the wires or other method of securing to the reflector are exaggerated for this example, we recommend twisting inside or clipping any wires, etc so as to look aesthetically pleasing. The other popular mounting method is to place Incandescent fixtures inside a wooden canopy style hood, and then silicone mirrors, heavy duty foil, or mylar to the areas directly behind where the SHO will fit inside the fixtures so as to amplify the light from the SHO bulbs. This is a very simple albeit DIY method, although the pendent method is probably the simplest/quickest (and directs the most light into the aquarium by limiting Restrike. See picture above. The is photoshopped picture/diagram above displays approximate SHO lamp placement in a planted freshwater aquarium.<query> how to mount sho bulbs</query> This shows four lights, although for aquarium 4 feet or less in length, two lights is generally adequate (only one light for 2 feet or less in length) Suggested Wattage *As a generalization, 2 to 2.5 watts of Daylight SHO Lights are required for planted freshwater aquariums *For Marine Reef, 2.5 to 2.8 watts of these SHO lights (possibly mixed with other light types) Light (lamp) placement: Pendant vs. Mirror The advantage to a pendant reflector over a Mirror/Mylar/Foil (depending on reflection quality) is that it will radiant downward in aslightly more magnified fashion than a Mirror/Mylar/Foil, however the Mirror/Mylar/Foil canopy mount mehtod has one advantage over the pendant and that is more wide spread light distribution. So this choice comes down more to tank arrangement of plants or corals.<query> how many watts of light for aquarium</query> Light Penetration What is often a bigger issue, especially with deep tanks (over 24 inches) is to allow as much of the blue light (which is found as part of the light spectrum of these 6400 K lights) as possible through to the tank and often a glass top will block these light rays (over 60%) so using polycarbonate or no lid at all may do more for effectiveness than whether you use a mirror or pendent. Supplementing with Actinic blue/50,000K T5 orLED lights is also suggested for deeper tanks marine tanks, especially reef (generally not as important for planted freshwater) Specimen Placement One more point is depending on what you are using the SHO light for (or any high output light), I would move corals as high up in the water column as possible (in placement on liver rock or similar), or if this light is for FW plants I would move the high light requiring plants directly under the lights (or even elevate them with terracing, which can look quite attractive if done well and serve a dual purpose of aesthetics and better light energy absorption) Summary: Whatever method you use to install a SHO light for your aquarium (or Greenhouse/Hydroponics), please keep in mind that these are not an “out of the box” light (there are no installation kits) and require some DIY ability to best utilize their benefits.<query> what is the best light for a aquarium</query> However these are not all that difficult to install if your application has the room and the rewards of economical yet high powered useful light energy is well worth it for persons with at least some DIY abilities! For our business partners webpage: Business Partners; Great Links Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL) along with SHO (Super High Output) CFL are simple yet effective lights that fit into simple incandescent fixtures, reflectors, or simple focused flexible light fixture such as the Eco Light.

Thus you can easily see that it is impossible for anyone to lay down a fixed set of rules and follow them, in reference to each particular case. All well regulated cemeteries should have their own nursery so you could plant just whenever you have a favorable day. I have planted trees from our own nursery row as late as the third week in May, out in full leaf and without a single loss. This, of course, would be impossible if you had to buy your trees at some distance from home; hence the double advantage. It is common to note how little attention most people pay to the trees after they are once planted. Is it any wonder one sees so few really beautiful specimens? This is apparently due to the fact that they do not require his constant care, and usually seem to thrive without his aid; yet what a vast difference between a well trained, properly cared for tree and the one that has to take care of itself.<query> when to plant trees in a cemetery</query> Perhaps you have noticed in the early spring that a tree of a certain kind may come into flower earlier than another tree of the same variety. That which comes into flower earlier is the male, to be ready for its mate. In all of these elemental facts the tree is just as much alive as man himself and it presents an exceedingly interesting thing for one who is willing to think, to observe, to learn. I wish that it might be possible for people generally to see more into the great world of living things all about us. So often it happens that people go through the world and see almost nothing of the world in which they live. I think perhaps the most beautiful tribute to a tree that I ever heard was told by the President of the Elyria Ohio Rotary Club when I went down there several years ago to give this little talk on trees.<query> what is the meaning of tree</query> In introducing me he related this experience from his own life. He said, ""I have the most wonderful tree in the world at my house. Some fifteen years ago I had a little boy who was then three years of age. In the early fall he would go out to gather up the buckeyes, sometimes by pockets full and sometimes by baskets full, and bring them in and play with them. One day he took sick; the next day he was better. He went out as usual. This time he brought in just one large fine buckeye and played with it, and the next day he died. ""I took that large fine buckeye and carried it with me all the long winter. I would take it out every little while and look at it and was reminded of him. Then, when the spring came, I went out and planted it down under his sand pile.<query> when did buckeyes die</query> Later the sand pile was taken away, the buckeye sprouted and came up a healthy little plant. I built a fence around it and told the boys of the neighborhood that they might break anything, anything I had, the windows of my house or anything but please not to break this tree. They have respected my request and it stands there today, fifteen years old, the most wonderful tree in the world."" I thought as I listened to that story, that there was in this little tree not alone a monument to a little boy who died, but also a monument to a father's love. I wish that it might be possible for people to see something more in trees than just an accident, because as a matter of fact God Almighty put the trees here to help adorn the world. I have sometimes wondered what this world would be if we could remove from it all of the really fine things, if we could remove music, literature, art and religion and the beauty of the great outdoors—that great unmatched beauty of the world of living things.<query> why are trees important to the world</query> I have wondered what this world of ours would be. Have you ever thought of the immense importance of foliage? To the beauty of the world; to its livableness? Just remember, after the leaves have gone, this fall, when there is no blanket of white snow to cover the earth—then again in the early spring when the snow has gone, or is dirty. Look out across the landscape and see how ugly and barren it is. Then notice as the leaves come out and the grass comes forth, what a wonderful change there is with this color of green, this blanket of green that God put here to cover up the ugliness of a naked world. That is why it seems to me that we are likely to under estimate or perhaps neglect to think about the importance of trees to the world way beyond the question of their practical utility.<query> why are trees important</query> It seems to me that God must have known his business when he caused trees to grow upon this earth. You know there is one thing that does arouse me tremendously and that is to see the terrible butchery of trees. Almost everywhere I go I see this slaughter, very largely by the telephone and electric light companies—sometimes by, well, I will call them ""tree-quacks"", sometimes by well-meaning but ignorant tree owners who permit it. God intended that the tops should be on the trees. I am not saying that there is never a time when trees should not be cut back because sometimes it is necessary, if it is done right, but as a general proposition I think it is the most inexcusable thing that any man can be guilty of, to slaughter the trees as they grow. This is what happens: you cut the top of a tree off and you immediately destroy its circulation, and then naturally in her desperation she forces out the latent buds along the side of the stump, and presently you have a new and rather vigorous growth of new shoots, and that is what deceives a lot or people.<query> why do trees need to be cut back</query> They overlook the fact that the stump sticking up there is a constant invitation to disease. Science has demonstrated diseases in trees as it has in other forms of life. In trees it is called fungi, a parasite by nature; it lives by tearing down some other form of life. Now, wherever you see a decaying tree there is disease working and in a certain time of the year it throws out to the surface of the bark what they call fruiting bodies. You have seen them on the outside of trees; they look more or less like toadstools. Those fruiting bodies give off a myriad of microscopic spores that float through the air and most of them fall to the ground harmless, but some of those spores find lodgment in an open wound. It doesn't make any difference what causes the wound, it may be lightening or it may be a lawnmower in the hands of some careless man, anything that breaks the bark causes a wound and in to that wound some of these spores find their way and they start to grow, to send out their little threadlike tentacles, very much like cancer, and they travel up and down from one cell to another, eating, or consuming the cells.<query> what is the disease in trees called</query> That is what they live on, and finally you have internal decay. What we call decay is merely the result of this active disease that is working on the inside. You cannot have anything worse than a horizontal wound in a tree. You look at that wound under a microscope and it is very much like a sponge because the cells are hollow and you cut right across them and there you have your sponge-like effect, a constant invitation for the spores of the fungi to find lodgment there and start to grow and just as sure as the sun rises and sets there will be a decay because there is no life in that stump, there cannot be any life without leaves, so, down to the point where the new growth starts the decay proceeds and goes constantly on and on into the wood of the tree and after a while you have nothing but a mere shell, and so this thing that deceives people, this vigorous new growth in the little branches that are forced out from the latent buds is a screen to hide the ravages of disease in the wound.<query> what is the result of decay</query> But even if it didn't cause the destruction of the trees through disease and decay I cannot imagine why anybody can see beauty in a tree that is beheaded. I wonder sometimes what has become of men's sense of beauty. I heard a story from a member of Congress that interested me very much. I want to tell it to you now because I think it is more or less apropos to this band of tree butchers that we find in America. I had related in one of my talks in the House this little story about the buckeye tree, and after I sat down a member of the House from Florida came over and sat down beside me and told me that he wanted to relate an experience that he had the preceding summer. Now this gentleman was an old, white haired man, one of the most portly gentlemen that I have ever met, a man perhaps in the late sixties with wonderful poise and self control.<query> why was the buckeye tree beheaded</query> I have never seen him excited, and I have never seen him over enthuse. He related his little story somewhat like this, he said: ""When I was young and our first and only son was born my mother proposed that we plant a magnolia tree in the front yard in his honor. Being young and more or less irresponsible I laughed at the idea, but she persisted, so we planted a magnolia tree. ""The first time it bloomed was when he was graduated from high school; the next time it bloomed was when his sister was graduated. Then several years passed. The boy went away to war. In the war he contracted an incurable disease. He came back and lingered for a while, and finally passed away. ""Last summer they were going to widen the street in front of my house, and probably cut down that magnolia tree, so I went to see the city engineer.<query> when did the magnolia tree bloom</query> I said to him, Sir, I understand that you are going to widen the street in front of my house. He said, 'yes, that is the plan.' I said, 'Sir, I understand you plan to cut down the magnolia tree in my front yard.' He said, 'Well I am afraid we will have to.' ' Well, Sir, I came to tell you I shall shoot the man who cuts that tree.' He said, 'Do you mean it?' I said, 'Sir, I mean it. ' The man who cuts that tree I shall shoot and kill him.' ' Well,' he said, 'it won't be cut. "" Sometimes I think that is about the kind of treatment that is necessary to stop this unending slaughter of America's trees.<query> who cut down the magnolia tree</query> A tree demands very little care and attention if it be done annually, but that it must have to develop properly. How to save our trees? That is the problem; to prevent them from dying; to keep them in good health, strong and beautiful; to keep them with us. Surely these are admirable endeavors and worthy of much thought and attention. I cannot emphasize enough the necessity of removing the old bark of the trees once every two years just before spring opens. This should be gathered carefully and burned. It is not only of the greatest benefit to the growth and appearance of the tree, but it also destroys thousands of insects, larva and pupa in them, which have their winter quarters under the loose pieces of bark, just getting ready for their destructive work as soon as spring opens.<query> how often should you cut down trees</query> I see it everywhere I go, tens of thousands of them absolutely slaughtered and ruined. So far as telephone and electric light men are concerned I will make the statement that not more than 15% or 20% of the cutting is necessary that is usually done to get all of the wire clearance that is reasonably necessary for those wires to go through. I know because we have done a reasonable amount of it and have secured clearance, ample clearance with only a moderate amount of cutting. We cleared the trees in my home town for the telephone company there and didn't cut a single limb bigger than your thumb and gave them ample clearance. I think it is the most damnable slaughter, the most useless sacrifice of beauty that I know of in America, and sometimes I think the only kind of treatment that will answer is the kind of treatment that the tree butchers mete out to trees.<query> how much cutting is necessary for a telephone</query> That may sound a little harsh and yet I want to say, gentlemen that these men who slaughter the trees of America in this way defy all the laws of our country and all the laws of decency. They know no law and no restraint, only the law of force. I had an experience down in my home town—the telephone company was proposing to stretch a new line along the main street where I live and it is a beautiful street—I didn't make it so—the main street, where I live, the foresight of men fifty or seventy-five years ago made my street beautiful, and I was afraid of what would happen, so I called up the manager of the telephone company and asked him what their program was. He said, ""Well, we will have to put the wires through."" I said, '''Does that mean cutting?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""No more than is necessary."" Well, I said, ""Now listen, don't you cut any of those trees on the street where I live."" He said, ""what do you mean'?"" I said, ""I want to be perfectly frank with you, I have got a gun in the house, and the first fellow who undertakes to cut those trees I am going to use the gun on him, I know how to use it and it is in first class condition."" He said, ""What<query> do you cut trees</query> do you mean?"" I said, ""I mean business."" Well, as a matter of fact the trees weren't cut. I know of a case down in Poland, Ohio where one determined man in that community by his own force kept the electric light company from despoiling the trees that were a century old and were the pride and the glory of that community, the trees that made the town worth living in. It seems to me that what we need is just a little more of the fighting spirit out of which America was born in order to protect the rights of the public. Speaking along that line makes me think of the story about the minister who was lecturing his congregation on the subject of heaven and hell—an old fashioned subject. They used to talk a good deal about it, some of our modern ministers lecture on sociology, and books and theatres, and so forth, it used to be that they talked about heaven and hell.<query> why was the fighting spirit of america born</query> Anyway this must have been an old fashioned sort of minister because he proceeded at some length to plead with his congregation about this subject of great importance. Finally after he had finished he said to them, ""Any of you who want to go to heaven, stand up."" They all stood up except one old fellow who was asleep. They sat down and he said, ""Any of you who want to go to hell, stand up."" The old fellow woke up just in time to hear the last part of it and he stood up and looked the minister straight in the eye. The minister looked at him and said, ""My good man do you know what you are standing up for?"" He said, ""I do not, but you and I seem to be the only ones for it."" Now, with your permission I would like to talk for just a little while about another subject which seems to me of great and far-reaching importance and that is the question of forest devastation.<query> who said stand up for me</query> I am interested in it tremendously because it seems to me that this question of forest is one of the things that project themselves farther into the future of our country than most of the things that we ordinarily concern ourselves with. I call you to witness that we have lived through every tariff law that was ever enacted whether it be a high tariff, or a low tariff, and we have lived through every tax bill, high or low, somehow we have lived through it, and we have lived through a lot of other laws, good and bad, but there are some things that no nation can live through and remain great and strong and one of those is the destruction of the great natural wealth that only God can make. I have reference particularly to the destruction of America's forest wealth. A hundred and fifty years ago America became a new nation and this land was endowed by the creator with a greater quantity probably of natural wealth than any nation in the history of the world, and we started in with a prodigal hand to spend it as fast as we could go.<query> what is the destruction of the forest</query> Those of our forefathers who landed in Virginia under Captain John Smith sent back word to the mother country that they had discovered a land of inexhaustible fertility, and so it seemed, but you can go into Virginia today and buy thousands of acres almost for a song because it has been robbed of its fertility, it lacks the power of producing things in sufficient quantity to pay for cultivation. As a matter of fact I see an increasing number of abandoned farms from the Atlantic Seaboard west. In my own county there are 400 abandoned farms and this section was settled less than 200 years ago. Those of our forefathers who landed on the coast of New England carne face to face with a wonderful covering of trees, trees everywhere and yet today the New England states have exhausted four fifths of their original lumber supply; half of their remaining supply is in the State of Maine that is largely pulp wood varieties.<query> where are abandoned farms</query> They already import 30% of their own consumption and will import more and more as time goes on. Even the great Empire State of New York that once was the greatest producer of lumber in the Union today produces only 10% of its own consumption. They produce 30 board feet per capita every year and use 300. Penn's Woods, Pennsylvania, named because of its wonderful covering of trees has so far exhausted its supply of timber that they produced today less than enough for the Pittsburgh district alone, about 20% of their own consumption. The great lake states where there was a wonderful supply of magnificent white pine—that is almost gone. The original supply was estimated to have been 350 billion board feet, and it is now reduced to 8 billion, and it will be all gone in perhaps ten or fifteen years.<query> what is the largest producer of lumber in the united states</query> The wonderful supply of yellow pine in the south Atlantic and Gulf States is four-fifths gone. So I might go on and tell you the story, step by step, but the last report of the United States Forest Service tells us that the entire eastern half of the United States will be stripped bare of its timber from a commercial standpoint within twenty-five years. Of course there will be many individual trees, but speaking commercially the eastern half of the United States faces a lumber shortage, or exhaustion. And also that same report says that the apparently inexhaustible supply in the far west will be all gone in thirty-five or forty years, according to the present rate of consumption because as each section is stripped of its timber it lays a heavier and heavier demand on the remaining sections. One of the men with our company—that is the Davey Tree Expert Company (incidentally I have to stay in business to make the money I spend in politics) one of the men with our company was working in Mississippi last winter.<query> when will the eastern half of the us be stripped of timber</query> He knew I was interested in this subject of conservation and he wrote to me about the conditions he found in the little town down there. He said the town had been built around the lumber industry and the whole supply was exhausted so the company had been bringing logs from the Pacific Coast by way of the Panama Canal, up through the Gulf of Mexico by rail so this little town in Mississippi could keep alive. That is not an isolated case; there are many many communities that have almost ceased to exist because of the exhaustion of the lumber supply. I was told last summer by a representative of the United States Forest Service that one-fifth of the timberland in the state of Michigan had gone back to the state for nonpayment of taxes. It is land good for nothing else except growing trees and the trees have been so entirely cut away, the land has no more value, and nobody wants it, so they dumped it back on the state for the rest of the people to carry the load.<query> why did the lumber industry stop</query> However, the question of lumber supply is only one phase of this far-reaching proposition. I sometimes wonder how we would carry on in our scheme of civilization if we ran out of lumber. Stop to think of all the things into which lumber enters and ask yourselves how we would maintain our scheme of civilization, our standard of living and progress, without lumber, and you have some idea of the magnitude of the problem. But that isn't all. I have in mind the terrible tragedy that we were reading about so much in the papers this Last spring when the flood waters were sweeping down through the Mississippi Valley. I am thoroughly convinced that the more serious aspects of that flood were due to the destruction of the trees around the headwaters of the streams that makeup the Mississippi. It wasn't the water that fell down into the Mississippi Valley, it was the water that fell in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Indiana and Kentucky and Illinois, Wisconsin, Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa—all that great section where the trees have been cut away and the water sweeps quickly into the little streams and it pours rapidly into the larger streams and finally into the Father of Waters.<query> why did the mississippi flood happen</query> ""One ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure"" and the removal of the old bark is just such an ounce of prevention against the ravages of caterpillars and scale in summer. PRUNING I was taught some years ago by our local nurserymen, to do all tree pruning when the trees were dormant, or when the sap was down; but from my own experience, and observation of late years, I do all my pruning when the sap is up and I recommend same to all my friends. In our own locality, the center of Ohio, I find the month of June and usually the first two weeks of July (if the weather conditions are right) is the best season of year to do this work. One should always use a sharp, fine-tooth saw, and as soon as the trees are pruned paint the cuts with one coat of thin paint.<query> when to prune trees in ohio</query> And so the channel was just too small, it couldn't hold it, and we had a flood, and we will have more and more floods as the destruction continues because nature made the trees, the forest trees as a reservoir to hold the water back and let it seep out gradually. Go out sometime into the woods and see the condition that the creator made. Look down at the wonderful soil, loose, porous, soil it is and take up a handful of it and see the provision that was made to absorb the moisture and then watch the water in imagination as it comes down from the heavens through the leaves and settles into this loose porous soil and follow it further, in imagination as it travels by underground channels to the little springs, and see how those springs feed the little streams, and they in turn feed the rivers, and thus you have a continuity of water supply.<query> why did nature make the trees</query> But when man comes along in his breathless haste to get rich quick, or for some other reason and he cuts the trees away, allows the land to be burned over. When the rain descends from the heavens it sweeps across the surface of the land and takes with it the precious topsoil, precious top soil. It is said by scientists that it takes nature ten thousand years to make one inch of fertile top soil by the process of decaying vegetation, piling one little particle upon another—ten thousand years, and oh so little time to wash it away. I stood by the Potomac River in Washington some two or three years ago when that stream was on the rampage and like all flood waters that stream was also muddy, and I thought to myself: what part of my country is making this terrible contribution to the sea?<query> how long does it take for topsoil to form</query> And then after the flood waters had subsided I went into Potomac Park again and there on the grass I saw an inch or two of precious top soil deposited there by the mad rushing waters, but only a little fraction of the enormous quantity that had been carried down to the ocean. Reading in one of the News Weekly Magazines this last spring about the flood in the Mississippi I came across one paragraph that struck me with great force. It told how fishermen were coming back from the Gulf of Mexico and describing the condition of the water. It said that the Gulf Stream was actually becoming discolored by the prodigious quantity of soil carried down by this flood. It also told how great schools of fishes were coming far out into the Gulf in order to escape suffocation. This question of the washing away of the precious topsoil it seems to me is one of the very serious aspects of our forest devastation policy, but that is only one side of it.<query> what was the effect of the gulf stream flood</query> There is also the question of adequate water supply. Our capital city, Columbus, Ohio several years ago was face to face with a water famine, the situation was so bad that they held prayer meetings calling upon God Almighty to save them from the threatened catastrophe—that is our human system, we do everything wrong then when we get into trouble we call upon God to pull us out of the hole. Anyway they had their prayer meetings and whether God answered their prayers we don't know, but a providential rain did come and averted this terrible catastrophe. Can you imagine anything more serious than a city of 300,000 people without water? Columbus secures its municipal supply from the Sciota River and that stream is all but dried up all because the trees and the vegetation had been cut away from its head waters, and so sometimes you have too much water and that causes a flood and then you have too little water at other times, and that causes a drought.<query> why is columbus ohio without water</query> That is a part of the penalty that man must pay for his folly and for his destruction. There is another aspect to it that is both interesting and important. Scientists tell us that one tree in an average growing season throws into the air about five hundred barrels of water through its leaves by the process called transpiration. Just as our breath is laden with moisture so there is thrown out through the leaves great quantities of moisture in vapor form to remain in the air to be condensed and come back as rainfall. Then it is taken up again by vegetation and again it is thrown out in vapor form to be condensed once more and thrown out as rainfall. So you have the constant supply of water for all forms of life. . You probably have heard the old saying about the sun drawing water, referring to evaporation.<query> how much water is thrown out of trees</query> Science tells us there is infinitely more water thrown into the air through the leaves of vegetation than from all the evaporation and all the rivers and lakes in the ocean. It is a constant supply of moisture into the air by the process of transpiration through the leaves. Speaking about conservation—I heard a story about a Scotchman that may interest you. I have a suspicion that maybe there are some Scotchmen here. Well, you know they have a reputation for being rather thrifty. I don't know whether it is true or not. Anyway this particular Scotchman was sitting in a hotel lobby feeling pretty blue and looking as though he were beyond the power of consolation. A stranger came by and asked him what the trouble was and Sandy said, ""I am on my Honeymoon and I couldn’t afford to bring my wife."" Now I want to refer, in closing, to two other things, first to the tragic example of China because we have in the example of China ample evidence of' what may happen to America and a proper indication of what we ought to do.<query> why is it important to conserve water</query> China once had a wonderful covering of trees, very much like our own, perhaps not as fine and still a very wonderful covering and China did with her trees just exactly as we are doing with ours. She cut them away, allowed her land to be burned over and then the floods came and swept away her precious topsoil. China has become a land of perpetual famine. They only have one crop in seven years. In the other years of that period they must look to the world for food. One of my brothers took a trip around the world some three or four years ago and he was interested in the subject just the same as I and when he returned he told me of his observations. He described how when they came up through the Yellow Sea he was impressed by the increasing chocolate color of the water and he wondered what its significance was.<query> why is china a land of perpetual famine</query> Then when they went out across the land and saw those miles and miles of barren land, he began to understand. He told me that he saw men and women and children out gathering weed stalks by the roadside with which to cook their rice, they had no wood for fuel, not even bushes, just weeds. There are millions of acres of land in China where nothing grows at all, not even weeds, then there are other millions and millions of acres where nothing much more than weeds can grow, and so they have a land stripped of its fertility in large part with an enormous population, and I am afraid that the case of China is hopeless. I wish that my country might profit by that example because no land in the history of the world ever survived the destruction of its great natural wealth.<query> where does weed grow in china</query> That land where Christ was born today supports only 10% of the population that it did 1900 years ago, because the land has been robbed of its fertility and fewer and fewer people can live there. Meanwhile the population of the world is increasing. This question of preserving the fertility of the soil so that it may grow food for man and animals and all forms of life I think is one of the great problems of this and future generations. I am interested in this question because it affects my country. Possibly you and I may not see the severe consequences of our national folly, we may be dead and gone before its worst phases appear, but even so we have a very great responsibility for the safekeeping of this great heritage. Our America—we sing of it in song, we glorify it in our literature, but what is America?<query> why is the soil important to the survival of life</query> Is it land? Is it rivers and lakes or mountains? No. That isn't America, because this land was here many years ago and the same mighty rivers were flowing to the sea, long before civilization began and the same majestic mountains lifted their lofty summits to the skies before man was, and even the same stars twinkled in the nighttime before there was any life upon this globe. No—America is a great human thing, a great new system, and philosophy of government. America is people and those things which affect people are the things of supreme and lasting importance. Nothing is of greater significance than the destruction of the basic wealth upon which people exist. I am tempted to relate to you the little story of my good old father, because it was from him that I received my first inspiration in the cause of conservation, from his lips years ago I heard the story.<query> what is the difference between america and the world</query> Never leave any stubs when pruning, but cut always just as close as possible to the trunk of the tree, so that the cambium gets a chance to close the wound, and the sap must be up in the tree in order to promote this growth. Cambium is the white and softer part of wood between the inner bark and the wood. It is popularly called the sap-wood. This is annually acquiring firmness and thus becoming hard wood. If a limb is cut when the sap is down, and has to stand several months, before the sap rises up again this cut becomes hard and dry, and in most cases the cambium never starts to grow and in a few years the cut is rotten and makes a home for insects and we all know that where we have insects we cannot have a healthy tree.<query> what is the cambium</query> He was born in, England at a time when there were no public schools, and he was twenty-one before he knew his ABC’s. That is almost inconceivable to us in this country where education is free, but it was the general rule then in England because only the children of the aristocracy had the advantages of education. So he started in as a full grown young man to learn to read by the slow painful process of self-education. He began with a little copy of the New Testament and a little dictionary, picking out one word at a time until he finally acquired a grammar so that he might learn to put the words together properly. He showed me one time not very long before he passed away the old faded copy of the New Testament from which he learned to read and on it there was a brown spot where a drop of milk had fallen as he studied while he milked in the long ago.<query> when was edgar robertson born</query> Then, like millions of other sturdy sons of Europe he heard the call of America, this great land of freedom and opportunity, and he came here to work out his destiny. He pursued his education still further studying by night and working by day until he finally acquired an education that would have done credit to the average college graduate, and I sometimes think a more profound education. But one of the things that impressed me most about him was the fad that he became one of the really fine Americans that it has been my privilege to know. He learned every word of our Constitution, every word of it. He learned every word of every verse of America and every word of the Star Spangled Banner, and until old age laid its heavy hand upon him he could sing those songs with a zeal and a fervor that were good to see.<query> what was the most important thing that john f. kennedy learned about He became a full citizen under our law at the first opportunity, and he told me of that sacred day when he raised his right hand and foreswore allegiance to the British Crown and swore allegiance to the flag of America, and his eyes filled with tears as he described that most sacred day of his life. I saw him from the time I was a little fellow, and long before I could comprehend the significance of it, every time he passed by Old Glory he tipped his hat in veneration. I think perhaps there is something in that story for you and for me, for those of us who were born here, those of us who were privileged to come here by choice to make this a home because this great wonderful America, this new nation is a rich heritage, America is only a hundred and fifty years old, that is only two normal life times.<query> who tipped his hat in veneration</query> It seems quite a while to talk about a hundred and fifty years, but just a little while ago we were reading about King Tut who reigned in Egypt thirty-five hundred years ago, and as we look back across the long span of time we begin to realize how very young America is, because in that period of thirty-five hundred years we can see countless nations rise and fall, kingdoms and principalities and powers almost without number come and go and then we realize how very young America is and when we take an inventory of our situation we realize how far we have gone on the road of destruction.

This country, great and wonderful as it .is came into our keeping as stewards to use and to enjoy for a little while, and then we must pass it on and when we received our America with all of its matchless and manifold blessings we received also a great and everlasting responsibility to keep our America as great and as wonderful and as worthwhile as it was when we received it.

Siebenthaler Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 41st Annual Convention It is obvious to all of you that any exhaustive treatment that might be given the subject of ""Nursery Materials for Cemeteries and How to Plant Them"" would soon assume the proportions of an encyclopedia of horticulture.<query> when was the aacs convention</query> I think the secret of fine exterior foliage is mostly due to a good, clear, healthy interior, entirely free from suckers, dead wood and all small branches that do not help to make up a pleasing exterior. The sunlight and air should reach every part of the tree. Do not prune simply because you see your neighbor pruning, but start about your work with the aim of accomplishing a certain fixed purpose, and never cut a branch from your tree unless you have a reason for so doing. The tree may be spread, or it may be contracted, by cutting to a bud that point outward for the former or to a bud that inclines inward for the later. If this be done intelligently it will prove of great value in the training of your trees. As a rule, the weaker the growth the harder it should be pruned back.<query> when to prune a tree</query> This will encourage a heavier wood growth the following season. By this article it can be seen that growing fine trees is not a sinecure, but still it is a glorious work, demanding a man's whole energy and unfailing love for Nature, and one of her most beautiful creations--the tree.

C. Simonds Graceland Cemetery, Chicago, IIlinois Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 39th Annual Convention Of all the characteristics of a cemetery, which is the most desirable? A cemetery should first of all be comforting. This means that it must be beautiful, restful, secluded. To attain these characteristics it must include within its boundary much of nature. What is nature? In its broadest significance it includes almost the universe. Some persons use this term as if it were synonymous with the Deity, saying, Nature does this, nature does that, nature's laws are the laws of God.<query> what is the characteristic of a cemetery</query> Although we sometimes speak of inanimate nature, it is often personified. Often we hear the expression ""Mother Earth"", perhaps less frequently nature is referred to as ""mother"". Mother most endearing of all words. The poet says: “Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind."" She is represented as soothing and comforting and especially as healing the mind, the part that is in greatest need of healing when a dear friend is left to the permanent care of a cemetery. Nature, therefore, is the most important feature to have in mind in designing a cemetery. For the purpose of this paper, nature will be considered as that manifestation of the out of doors that is independent of man. We find it in its most attractive and familiar shape in the woods, the borders of lakes and rivers, the hills and valleys, ravines and sky and in the clouds.<query> what is nature's meaning</query> Nature has infinite variety. When we detect the work of man, as in an orchard, a field of corn; or a row of trees along an avenue, we cease to think of what we see as the work of nature, out rather look at it as man's creation. We see nature when we look at the wooded margin of an open field with its skyline of oaks, its thicket of wild crab apples blooming in the full sun, its viburnums and elderberries. We see her along the rights of way of railroads as we journey from one place to another. In spring or early summer, when we look from a car window, we are greeted with large beds of iris, lupines, shooting stars, spiderworts, butterfly weeds, black-eyed susans, ferns, or a little later, with the flowers or Joe Pye Wood, wild roses, lilies, cardinal flowers, goldenrod, asters and hundreds of others of nature's planting.<query> what is nature's work</query> If the train passes through woods, we may see here and there, as we look from the car window, masses of sassafras, filled with yellow flowers in spring, rich with foliage throughout the summer and gloriously colored with yellows and reds in autumn. We may also see oaks, maples, hawthorns, dogwoods, elderberries, prairie roses, wild grapes clematis, bittersweet and a host of other woody plants all beautiful and all helping to give what we call ""the charm of nature."" What is this charm which we feel when we go to the woods, when we go to pine forests, when we so to uncultivated prairies which glow with wild sunflowers, asters and goldenrod and when we wander along the wooded banks of lakes and rivers and through wooded ravines? It is difficult to analyze and define, hut it is due to nature's perfect freedom, to beauty of outline and color, to deep shadows and bright lights, to many things being hidden by foliage or inequalities of ground, to the air of mystery that pervades things in which man has no hand.<query> what is the charm of nature</query> It is this charm of nature which we should try to introduce into cemeteries. It is this that makes her ""consoling and kind"". Many cemeteries do not have this charm. Often one sees from the train cemeteries fully exposed to view on all sides and containing only monuments, headstones and a few forlorn trees. Even some pretentious cemeteries with very costly monuments and perfectly kept lawns lack this charm which soothes and comforts. Are there any cemeteries in which this comforting characteristic can be found? Mr. Strauch introduced it into Spring Grove Cemetery in the naturalistic /borders of the lakes and in the preservation of the wooded ravines. Recently a cemetery has been established on Long Island which bids fair to contain the charm of which I speak. This cemetery, designed by the Olmsteds, is to have no stonework above the ground.<query> what is the charm of a cemetery</query> A family name may appear on a stone tablet set even with the turf. There is a plentiful supply of shrubbery to separate one lot from another. When nature has had time to correct the inevitable imperfections and rawness of new plantings, this may become one of her most charming retreats. Many cemeteries contain touches of the charm of nature, but I know of none really perfect. It is true that people's tastes differ and we have different points of view. One telephone man said that to his eye a line of straight telephone poles on each side of a road with arms carrying a plentiful supply of wires was the most beautiful decoration a thoroughfare could have, but I think even he would have hesitated about putting such a decoration in a cemetery. These opinions, however, are evidently somewhat biased. A lover of nature has nothing to sell, no ax to grind.<query> what is the most beautiful decoration in a cemetery</query> He is merely anxious to have people enjoy with him the beauty that he sees. The appreciation of this beauty is something that must be cultivated in order to be fully enjoyed. Some do not even see a sunset until their attention is called to it. Some see no beauty in winter, while others experience great enjoyment at that season in the branching of trees, the twiggery of shrubs, the snow and the glistening ice-covered branches. There are two or three things which seem desirable in order to secure that beauty of nature which is so comforting. The first is to reduce the amount of stonework either by planting out most of the monuments and headstones, or by reducing them to inconspicuous dimensions. Some of the money that is spent for monuments should be spent in securing more land so that there will be room for shrubs and flowers.<query> what is the best way to preserve the beauty of nature</query> We should appreciate the fact that while a perfect lawn is most desirable in some places, there are other places where the ground cover should include other things. Where height is not objectionable, lilacs will often spread out and make a beautiful ground cover when left undisturbed. The same is true of many other shrubs. Where land is poor and sandy perhaps nothing in the shrub line is better for a ground cover than the aromatic sumach, which is beautiful at all seasons, and especially attractive in the fall with its rich coloring. For a still low covering, there are many vines that are suitable. In the deep Shade of woods the Virginia creeper often makes a beautiful cover, hiding the entire ground with a layer of leaves of a delightful green in summer and often richly colored in autumn. Wild violets, myrtle, Japanese spurge, moneywort, ground ivy and carpet bugle are a few of the many beautiful ground covering plants.<query> what plants are good ground coverings</query> In a neglected country cemetery a large area became covered with cypress spurge. This is a beautiful little Euphorbia and while it is often called a weed, it was the most attractive thing in the cemetery being green arid fresh-looking while the grass everywhere else was brown. The neighboring farmer called it cemetery grass and the first question he asked was how to get rid of it. Often, too many so-called bedding plants are used in a cemetery. These bring in revenue and are showy in summer, but they leave the ground bare from October until May. To bring in the charm of nature we should use more hardy perennials. These often beautify waste places in a most satisfactory way. They are on hand from early in the spring until snow comes and even their dead stems and seed vessels are often graceful and beautiful throughout the winter.<query> what plants are used in a cemetery</query> Many city dwellers are in the habit of going to northern Wisconsin or northern Michigan for rest and recreation during the summer. Some of these have asked ""Why can't I have my cemetery lot like the northern woods which I love 80 much?"" These persons certainly feel the charm of nature and would like to have this charm about their final resting place. The longer we live and the more we observe, the more shall we be convinced of the truth of that oft-repeated saying, ""Nature is the best teacher"". The superintendent who can introduce foliage and flowers as nature uses them everywhere in covering waste places, creating forests, developing secluded beauty spots and doing all this while concealing his own part in the work will be the most successful in the development of a really worthy cemetery. In a cemetery well endowed with the charms of nature, one cannot see from end to end and from side to side and on beyond to surrounding buildings or farms.<query> why can't i have my cemetery lot like the northern woods</query> From every point there will be views, some wide, some narrow, and these will be bounded at the sides and terminated by foliage. The side boundaries will not be straight but will recede here and there into bays, tempting one on to see into their depths. Against the foliage will be seen, from time to time, quantities of flowers, wild crab apple blossoms, lilacs, flowers of hawthorn, forsythia and a hundred others. Here and there at the base of the foliage there may at times be the blossoms of iris, peonies, goldenrod, coreopsis and other flowers too numerous to mention or if it is in the fall, there will be attractive fruits, foliage and the blossoms of witch hazel. If there is a hill or ridge, it will be masked at the top with the foliage of trees reaching from the ground to the skyline so that one can easily imagine in looking at the upward slope that it extends on indefinitely to a great height.<query> what is the foliage of a tree</query> If there is a valley, the views into its depths will be preserved. There will be extended openings showing at the bottom a green turf or the foliage of low growing plants like moneywort, myrtle or partridge berry, or perhaps, there will be a stream or lake or little pools reflecting the sky and forming jewels in the landscape. If there is a good view outside of the cemetery to a distant hill, lake or river, or to a sunset, this view will, of course, be preserved. In such a cemetery the stone monuments will be inconspicuous, but the cemetery as a whole will be a memorial park, a fitting monument for all buried within its enclosure where ""Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind.""

Plumb Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention Mankind is living today in the Air Age.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> We turn the switch of the radio and out of the air comes reports of the days news from cities miles away. Lives are saved by the S. O. S. sent out from ships in distress. Our mails are being carried day and night over a vast net work of airways and the air has become the highway of travel between all countries and all people. We not only breathe the air for the very existence of life itself but in countless other ways are we dependent upon air in this modern age. Nothing is more universally distributed over the earth's surface and it is as free to the scientist as it is to plants and animals. Air is composed of the four common elements: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, but nitrogen is in the greatest abundance. Plants and animals are composed of the same four elements and nitrogen is the plant food required in the largest quantities.<query> why do we breathe air</query> As man's dependence for food is almost entirely on plant growth it is of great importance that our supply of nitrogen be increased to take care of the ever increasing population of the world. It is estimated that the air over every square mile of land contains twenty million tons of nitrogen or thirty thousand tons over every acre. Mother Nature with unusual impartiality has distributed nitrogen to every country in proportion to its area. The problem of the Scientist was how to extract this nitrogen from the air and make it available as a plant food. It was known for ages that lightning fixes or converts some of the nitrogen into a chemical compound which the rain and the snow carries into the ground where the plant roots can absorb it. It was known that clovers and other leguminous crops took some of the nitrogen from the air, but all of these processes are slow and the Scientist struggled for centuries to find the secret of extracting some of this abundant nitrogen from the air so that it could be used for the good of mankind.<query> how much nitrogen is in the air</query> The new concentrates contain no weed seeds or waste material. Their application is easy and pleasant, the labor cost is reduced arid the exact amount necessary for each plants requirements can be supplied and all guesswork eliminated. So literally, ""OUT OF THE AIR"" has come our most necessary plant food. As the population increased the area of fertility must be expanded. The day is coming when one acre must produce as much as two does now. We must adapt ourselves to these new methods and prepare for even greater discoveries which will improve the fertility of our soils.

Moore Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention I chose the subject, ""The Influence of Landscape Gardening on International Relationship"" because landscape gardening is a work in which you are vitally interested and because no phase of human endeavor yields more attractive results nor appeals more to the finer susceptibilities of the human heart.<query> when was the aacs conference</query> The apparent result of the practice is the transformation of unsightly places in all communities of note, into spots upon which the eye delights to rest. Cemeteries today—these sacred spots, the laying out of which it is your duty to superintend—are no longer called places of the dead, places shunned by the public, but have become through your zeal gardens of living beauty—a tribute to the intelligence of man and a sign that civilization is advancing. It should not be assumed that a beautifully laid out and planted cemetery or a beautiful park, are assets only to the community in which located. The influence of beautifully landscaped areas extends far beyond their own environs. The passing tourist notes them; he speaks about them. They thus become an example to be emulated. Many towns and cities are known throughout the length and breadth of North America by reason of their beautiful parks and cemeteries.<query> why are cemeteries important</query> In the hearts of all civilized people is a love for the Beautiful things of the Creation—flowers and trees and shrubs—and so, in life, as if drawn by an invisible magnet, we find ourselves attracted to these places of beauty and in the end we have so ordained that when the soul hath left its tenement our bodies shall repose unforgotten in areas where each succeeding year the opening buds and leaves and flowers proclaim ""There is no Death"". Such, Mr. President and members of the American Association of Cemetery Superintendents, is your work and mission. You build a rampart of living beauty around the places where our dust shall lie and which, as a result, are no longer referred to as ""places of the dead."" You hold this convention in Canada because you are attracted; you are interested in our cemeteries and parks and by the beauty of our home surroundings and landscapes.<query> what is the purpose of the american association of cemetery superintendents</query> Millions of your people visit Canada for the same reason, and I may add, because you like us, and Canada is rapidly becoming the summer playground of North America. Thus the work of man in his efforts to supplement nature in planting to hide the unsightly and to enhance the already beautiful is having a great effect in bringing together our peoples and in strengthening and cementing the bonds of good-will and friendship which for more than a century have been the talk and wonder of the world. You may be surprised to know that in Ontario, of which Toronto is the capital city, there is an organization known as the Ontario Horticultural Association which has a membership of 80,000 and comprises 285 societies. (It is purely amateur and is the largest of its kind. As you drive along the roads and through the municipalities you observe the gardens, the plantings of shrubs, the flowers of all kinds.<query> what is the largest horticultural association in canada</query> To this organization should largely, go the credit for this desirable condition. Our people are influenced by a desire to have beautiful homes and also that the sight of them should give pleasure to visitors from the states. They are interested in them. They desire their friendship rather than their money, and they find that the influence of the beauty they have created coupled with the beauty of park and cemetery and street within our municipalities is doing more to bring about a closer feeling of friendship than any other single factor. Through this attraction the people of the United States and Canada are getting together in a way previously undreamed of and as a result a full and proper understanding will inevitably accrue. It has been claimed that good roads are the attraction. No, not solely. Were these roads to run hundreds of miles through a wilderness, through a desert, they would be deserted except by the adventurer.<query> why are the people of the united states and canada attracted to each other</query> Good roads are but one factor. There are two others—beauty and friendship—and of the latter, the most important, we offer you good measure, pressed down and running over. By reason of this understanding, this closer friendship, your country and mine, two great English speaking nations, have found a common ground upon which can be expressed this great love and regard for each other in a way that will be the admiration and envy of the world. We are going to establish the world's most beautiful peace memorial at a point upon our border—an International Peace Garden. In this great garden, one half in the United States, the other in Canada, the landscape architects craft will find its greatest expression, and the influence of the resultant beauty coupled with its great sentiment, will be such as to draw all peoples—and it will become the world's greatest shrine.<query> where is the peace garden</query> What will the influence of this garden be on international relationships? Within its vast area will be trees and shrubs and flowers from all parts of the earth, Gardens beautifully landscaped to represent the national style of various countries, The governments of both countries will be asked to neutralize the area and to it will come the people of the hundred nations which compose the population of the United States and Canada and people from overseas and from the Latin countries to the south and all will be citizens of this great and beautiful area. Nothing can be so beautiful as a garden, nothing more attractive, and it will belong to the people themselves, and the names of all subscribers will be kept for the eyes of future generations to scan; the adults in one set of volumes, the children in another, for all are to be given an opportunity to subscribe to raise the endowment of five million dollars.<query> what will the influence of this garden be on international relations?</query> Nothing appeals to the human heart more than beauty. This garden will be not merely a beautiful expression of the love of each nation for the other, but a living and enduring one. It will not crumble nor decay like a shaft of granite. The dust of centuries shall not bury it. Each circling spring will see it renewed as a mountain stream is renewed in power and beauty, and a thousand years hence it will, in its majestic grandeur, still be the greatest symbol of international friendship and goodwill. The first International Peace Garden will be the world's strongest fortress, stronger than loop holed battlement or dugout of concrete and steel, for these cannot, stand the brunt of modern warfare. It will be the fortress of friendship built upon the rock of Christianity as expressed through the love of each nation; and in its shadow we may each forever crest secure.<query> what is the international peace garden</query> In friendship alone is there security, is there real happiness. Your act in coming to Canada is an act of friendship. Last year to this city came the National Association of Gardeners. That was an act of friendship. They have the same ideals and aims and are engaged in the same great work. They sponsor the International Peace Garden project. I wonder if you realize how much your lives and work influence the thoughts of the masses toward life's better things. Your work is not a job; it is an influence. The burial of the dead is a job. The beautification of God's acre is an influence. The poet says: ""Tis all a checkerboard of nights and days Where destiny with men for pieces plays, Hither and thither moves and mates and slays And one by one back in the closet lays"".<query> what is the meaning of the poem tis all a checkerboard of nights and But that is not true. The influence of a life is not lost for it pertains to the soul. Your great national organization exerts an influence. It is devoted to the beautification not only of your cemeteries but of your country. You convene today to discuss your problems, to tell each other of the things you have accomplished and of the things projected and so your influence extends more rapidly than otherwise and will continue until it reaches from coast to coast and to result in a blessing to every community. This influence is not only a national influence but an international one. The standards you set in the laying out and maintaining of your cemeteries are emulated by Canada. Your cemetery practices are very advanced. You have made a special study of the problems pertaining thereto. So in this respect we learn something from you.<query> what is the influence of a life</query> In certain other fields you learn from us which goes to prove that friendly international intercourse is a great medium of education as well as being the greatest factor in the maintenance of goodwill and understanding between nations. Men, and women who think only of their own immediate interests, and there are millions, lack vision. Their souls never find expression and are stifled. Men and women who think nationally have a broader, yet not the broadest, outlook. They who think internationally think of all men. To think internationally is to think like God. You and I in our own way and through the instrumentality of our chosen and common profession are today together. Americans and Canadians bound by the ties of relationship, in, that we speak a common language and in that our traditions, honorable in the extreme can be traced back to a common ancestry, and you are not ashamed of the old mother that gave you birth.<query> who thinks internationally</query> I am speaking now of your nation. We call you cousins but let me say that when the International Peace Garden is established, as it surely will, and when the international line is removed from its centre and when our governments neutralize it, we will be able to call you brothers and sisters, for all who visit this great neutral area, peoples of all nations of the world, will be citizens of that land. Today, according to our laws, you are aliens and foreigners. Recently I visited the United States and I belonged to the foreign class, but I see the day approaching when by reason of our getting together through the building of our great Fortress of Friendship, the Peace Garden, the word ""alien"" will be removed from the statute books of both countries and as long as Americans and Canadians are law-abiding it will not matter under which flag they sojourn.<query> when is the peace garden established</query> In conclusion will you permit me to say, and in this may there be inspiration. Your work is immortal, if anything on earth is immortal. If the painted canvas shall be treasured and so endure so shall those beauty spots you create be preserved and treasured. The results of your work are like the friendships you make today. Time shall not efface them; a century hence their verdure shall be as green, the trees as beautiful, and the ties of friendship the stronger, for such things are handed down from generation to generation. Beauty, friendship and love are all akin and in and through and round about them is God—and so they shall endure. In that great spirit of everlasting friendship Canada welcomes you. A spirit that will not tolerate any cloud to darken the international horizon; a spirit that long ago leveled the mountains of prejudice and has done so much to bring about such meetings as these where international friendships find their greatest expression and are cemented in indissoluble bonds.<query> what is the meaning of the painting friendship</query> In the Spirit of God—inspired friendship—which is the spirit of Canada and of the Peace Garden, you are welcomed. One day your people and ours and all peoples will throng the portals of a magnificent garden. Eyes will feast upon its beauty and be illumined with a new light. Hearts will be uplifted with a new hope and songs will rise to tongues which never sang. Children will join the chorus and the whole world will become akin. On that day will come the realization that the two great English speaking nations have set up an unparalleled and unprecedented example of love to the world. With it will also comes the realization that the hope of peace on earth and goodwill between nations as exemplified by ours, may forever endure. Hope that hellish war may forever be banished. So will the men and women who love beauty and the boys and girls born of these with the wisdom of years and the towering faith and vision of youth remove the mountains of hatred, of prejudice, and of envy and build an insurmountable barrier in the way of those who foment war—a barrier of love and create and leave to the world its most beautiful and significant memorial.<query> what is the spirit of the peace garden</query> Can the members of any organization have a greater influence than that? Is any work more conducive to friendly international relationship than yours? ""There is no death—what seems so is transition"". May this address be vibrant with life. May it convey the thought that good work well done, the beautiful thing created, will never be laid aside, but will continue through the years an example to those who follow and as a memorial to the integrity of those of your profession who went before. Now may I welcome you from the depth of my own in the words of an original poem! A LAND WITHOUT A LINE You came to the land of the Maple Leaf And we met you with a smile, We took your hands in a friendly grasp And hoped you'd stay a while. Though you live 'neath the Stars and Stripes And we 'neath the Union Jack, We speak the same old mother tongue— Uncle Sam and Jack Canuck.<query> who said there is no death—what seems so is transition</query> Between us runs three thousand miles, A line from coast to coast, Where never a fort and never a gun Is seen, we proudly boast. No bayonet with its murderous steel, No sentry anywhere, And we live in peace on either side As though no line were there. Side by side for a hundred years, May it be a thousand more! With never a word to cause us grief Nor any to make us sore. We have lived, and still the Union Jack And stars and Stripes unfurled Have flown together on the line The wonder of the world. Please God, till earth's last sun shall set And earth's last tear be shed, May we two nations still be friends When to heaven Thou call’st Thy dead.<query> where is the union jack</query> Until on that eternal morn As its glorious sun shall shine, Thy nations meet around Thy throne In a land without a line.

Let us take a burial ground conducted strictly upon the lawn system, say for instance, Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, where every surrounding indicates quietness and repose; the beautifully kept lawns, or open spaces surrounded by, or dotted with trees and shrubs bearing foliage of different hues, and shades of green. Each of these lawns or spaces are beautiful pictures in themselves, the trees being planted to throw light and shade on the sward heightens the beauty of the picture, and the effect upon the spectator is soothing and commands silent admiration. The very somberness of the surroundings indicates repose, and the mind immediately associates itself with the idea of the suitability of the cemetery as a final resting place. Beds planted with brightly colored flowers upon such lawns would be extremely out of harmony with the surroundings, and would not be desirable.<query> what is the meaning of flowers in a cemetery</query> Flower planting, no matter how artistically the work is done, is palpably artificial, and in the majority of cemeteries, out of place. A modern cemetery should appear as natural as possible. Imagine a nicely graded section adorned with trees and shrubs; the landscape artist has expended his energies in making it appear as perfectly natural as possible. A lot owner, whose portion is probably in the most prominent part, conceives the idea of having bed upon, or a border around his lot; the graves are also adorned with plants until the lot has the appearance of what a brother superintendent justly describes as a crazy patch-work quilt. No doubt the work is artistic, it does not harmonize with the surroundings, and to the trained eye of a landscape gardener the effect is harsh in the extreme. Lot owners, as a rule, care nothing for the harmonious appearance of the whole.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> To the individual lot is what they desire to call attention. One great aim of a cemetery superintendent should be to educate the people to the fact that ""in simplicity there is beauty;"" that a cemetery should look natural and park-like, and that the general appearance of the whole should be studied, rather than any particular spot. A stupendous task, more especially, in localities where the residents migrated from parts where the modern cemetery system is unknown. To their minds the old country churchyard, with its heterogeneous mass of flowers and vegetation is beautiful, and exactly what a burial ground should be. A few days ago the writer counted no less than 34 plants of different varieties, including mint upon a four-foot grave. Nothing can persuade the owner that it is not the most beautiful grave in the cemetery.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery superintendent</query> To prevent this class of ornamentation will require stringent rules, the enforcement of which means unpopularity, and few officials care to have their cemeteries unpopular. Several who have tried arbitrary rules in this direction have had to modify them in obedience to public feeling. There are many first class cemeteries where flower planting is extensively practiced, these are now being styled “flower garden cemeteries”. The question of the desirability of flower planting is settled as far as they are concerned. There are also burial grounds where flower planting would prove an improvement, but these places can scarcely be classed among the lawn cemeteries. They are simply grave yards, no great amount of landscape work having been lavished on their construction, and the management “a sort of go-as-you-please”. Then again, there is the dollars and cents side of the question.<query> what is flower planting in cemeteries</query> In the majority of cemeteries, both large and small, the desire to make money is paramount, and what should be has to give way to the mighty dollar. So few can afford to sacrifice cash to sentiment, and as most cemeteries are conducted for the money there is in them, flower planting will be encouraged. It is business, simply business. Where flower planting is considered desirable, study should be given to the use, as much as possible, of dwarf growing plants and such as bear flowers, quiet in color, for in few instances do the brighter colors harmonize with the surroundings of a burial ground. For cemetery work nothing looks worse than a bed containing a mixture of tall growing plants, such as dahlias, lilies, salvia, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks and others too numerous to enumerate. Pretty effects can be obtained with dwarf growing plants, especially when massed, and they are not so visible from a distance, therefore their appearance is not so striking, nor is the appearance of the lawn so broken as by their taller brethren.<query> what kind of plants are grown in cemeteries</query> For many years I purchased seed from specialists and had a failure each time, then I purchased strong plants which flowered well and in a hot season produced abundance of seeds which I had sown immediately it was ripe, under this treatment I produced thousands of plants. Bulbs. As the cultivation of hyacinths, snowdrops, scillas, crocus and similar spring bulbs is so well known I do not propose to offer any remarks on them. I trust this short paper has interested you as it is my earnest desire to do.

H. Hadley Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that I owe you a little bit of apology in appearing here with what comparatively little I have to show you.<query> what is a good shrub for planting</query> I had expected to show slides, which I always figure save me a lot of work because what the slides show I do not have to tell you, but unfortunately for me, at least, my slides apparently were lost on the way and have not shown up and in the very short time allowed me for tracing the slides and finding other illustrated material to show you I was unable to find very much. At this season of the year most of the material of this type is out on the road at fairs and other similar places. However, I will try to make up for the lack of actual material by explaining as we go along. You are particularly interested, I assume, in the question of the relation of this insect to industry which you people are representing, and I will try to confine my general remarks to that particular phase of the proposition.<query> what is the purpose of the slides</query> Before going much further I just want to pass around two mounts, one on each side, which show the insect itself in the various stages and two small samples of leaves showing the general way in which it attacks the foliage. Now a little about this insect and how it got here, and so forth. As you surmise from the name of the insect ""Japanese Beetle"", it is a native of the islands of Japan and of a certain few nearby islands in that part of the world. So far as we know the insect arrived in this country prior to 1916, and probably somewhere around 1910 to 1912, as a grub or soft grub about the roots of Japanese plants probably the Iris or Azalea or a similar variety, the roots of which come in the soil. It was first found in New Jersey in the vicinity of Riverton which is about nine miles above Camden, on the Jersey shore of the Delaware River in the summer of 1916.<query> where did the japanese beetle come from</query> At the time two inspectors of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture found it, not knowing what it was, but merely recognizing that it was something new to them and not a habitat found in this part of the country as far as they knew, and after a. little searching around there, being enthusiastic collectors as well as official inspectors, they tried to find as many individuals as they could to work with it. They found in the neighborhood of a dozen or so within a quarter mile radius of this same field. It happened to be along the edge of a little creek running through there where they found them. Four years after that, in 1920, one man collected in about two hours' time six quarts of the beetles. Now there are relatively 3500 beetles in a pint or 7000 in a quart so you can judge from that something of the increase in numbers of the insect since that time.<query> where are beetles found</query> The insect has spread annually, as we believe, at a definite rate from the original point of infestation, at the rate of five to ten miles per year in all directions. That we believe to be the normal actual spread of the insect in new environment. The map I have here which I will open up (does so); shows color variations which indicate the gradual spread of the insect from the original point of infestation. You will notice the different colors represent the spread year by year from the original point of infestation, which point is in the centre of the map here, and a scale of the map is an inch to a mile. You can get a good idea from that as to the rate of spread. This is the City of Philadelphia here (indicating) the Delaware River running up to Trenton, up here towards New York; this being Riverton right up here, and the original point of infestation about three miles out from the town.<query> how fast do insects spread</query> That represents, as well as we have any example, the comparatively steady spread of an insect in a new locality, steady and uniform, and we do not expect to be able to prevent that yearly spread, the actual spread of the insect. At the present time the infested area, or rather up to the beginning of the present season. the middle of June, the infested area covered 770 square miles, the increase being from less than one-half a square mile in 1916. So far as is known the insect does not occur any place in the world other than this infested area in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and its original home country in and near the islands of Japan; and one phase of our work, namely, quarantine enforcement is aimed to prevent as far as possible the widespread distribution of this insect.<query> where do mosquitoes live</query> Now a little as to the life history; you are more or less acquainted with a class of insects closely related to this Japanese Beetle, that is, the May beetles or June beetles, as they are commonly called. This Japanese insect belongs to the same general family of Mayor June beetles. If we start at the present season for instance to trace the life history throughout the year just now we are in the tail end of the beetle season. At the present time the progeny of the present beetle generation, the eggs and grub which have hatched from that, is in the ground feeding. They will remain here all winter and until next spring as a grub, increasing in size, at least increasing up to real cold weather and then hibernating for the winter and recommencing growth in the spring up until we will say about the middle of May.<query> what is the life cycle of a june beetle</query> Then there is a transformation, still under the ground, to what we know as the pupa stage. For instance, you are acquainted with the June beetle caterpillar, the beetle in the intermediate stage that is the cocoon, it is the intermediate stage. This stage lasts apparently about two weeks. The earliest beetles commence hatching between the 10th and 15th of June. Throughout the rest of the summer then there is a continuous hatching of the beetles. But the height of the season is from the latter part of June through July and early August that completes the life history for the year. There is but one generation per year so far as we know. A single female beetle will lay on an average of 30 to 60 eggs during her laying period which extends practically through the season of the beetle flight from the latter part of June until early August.<query> when do beetles hatch</query> Now, to give you an idea of the ability of this species to carry itself through and to show how it withstands adverse conditions. It does not breed as rapidly as some other insects but it has practically 100 percent of young that come through to maturity. To illustrate that point I will cite this one example. Two or three years back we were interested in finding out how many eggs would hatch and mature, so for a number of days we collected 100 eggs a day for a period of three weeks, taking them from different places in the soil and we averaged 99 or slightly better than that in the average of each 100 eggs hatched and the grub surviving. In another test we collected 1200 eggs in one day from a number of points, brought them into the laboratory, each egg was put in a small tin an inch in diameter, in soil and kept to determine the hatching, and we were able to hatch out exactly 1200 larvae from the 1200 eggs.<query> how many eggs hatch in a day</query> In other words, the insect in all stages is very resistant to adverse conditions, which explains why we have such an increase in the comparatively few years it has been here. Now a little bit about the habits of the insect: The more injurious stage is the parent beetles. We have records of their feeding on something over 200 different species of plants. I think it is about 220 including useful and cultivated varieties as well as non-useful weed varieties. There are certain different preferences they make. They show a preference for certain weeds such as smart weed, alder and mallow. Unfortunately, however, their preference is not strong enough to allow them or to keep them feeding on the weed varieties only and there seems to be a notable tendency, as the insect becomes better established, to leave the weed varieties for the cultivated varieties.<query> what is the most injurious stage of a beetle</query> There is only one cultivated class, ornamental, that is distinctly free of attack from the insect and that is the conifer group, arbor vitae, pines, hemlocks, all that class. We have no record of their feeding on that class of plants. Now, from your standpoint it is quite possible that the grub, or young form, will be equally, if not more seriously destructive because of the fact that they feed on the roots of plants, particularly grass. Now, they are comparatively a small grub and a few grubs in the sod we will say don't make any appreciable difference. I mean by that 100 to 150 per square yard. It sounds quite a few but from our angle it is not. Now they begin to be real serious when they run up to three to five hundred grubs to the square yard.<query> what kind of plants do grubs eat</query> Under these conditions you can and will get serious injury to the sod, particularly in the fall, and especially if that is followed by a hard winter there will be a good deal of dying out of the sod. Now, when they get what we call real dense, that is, over 500 to the square yard, then you are pretty sure to get serious injury. To give you an idea of how high they may go, a year ago this fall the highest infestation we found was 1035 grub in a measured square yard in the golf course at Riverton. That is a good many grubs. That figure is not simply based on one examination but an average of several in the most heavily infested places. We thought that was about the limit that could be reached but an examination already this fall, just beginning there, seems to promise a figure running up close to 1500.<query> how many grubs in a square yard</query> You can realize that that degree of infestation may be called a heavy infestation and undoubtedly will give lots of trouble. Now, a little about the work we are doing at Riverton because we all have run into at least the quarantine phase of it at one time or another; if you have not, you will, especially in the purchase of nursery stock from this part of the country. The work is divided into certain main phases: For instance, part has to do with the study of the life history, the habits of the insect in, the new environment, the changes from year to year as it becomes better acclimated, and so forth. Another line has to do with the importation and distribution of parasites which we hope will eventually hold the insect in reasonable check. In Japan the insect is not of any economical importance itself.<query> what is the quarantine phase of a bug</query> They have occasional outbreaks where it does some damage and they collect a lot by hand and destroy them; but I suppose in 100 years there has not been the amount of injury occasioned in Japan that there has been in the last two years in the heavily infested areas of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There are two reasons for the apparent non-importance of the insect in Japan. One is the cultural practices of the country. There is practically no waste land; everything is intensively cultivated, so that the opportunities for the insect to breed in large numbers are very limited. The breeding places chosen are grass fields, pastures and waste lands in general, and, of course, around this part of the country there are plenty of them. The other reason for the lack of serious injury in Japan is the presence of native natural enemies of the insect; in other words, there are insects which prey upon it, which we commonly call parasites.<query> why are there no insect in japan</query> These parasites we know to be present there in reasonable abundance. We have now three or four men in that part of the world who are studying the situation and sending us parasites as fast as they have material available. The parasite material is shipped to us and it is taken care of at the laboratory. Some times it comes at the time of year and at the stage where the parasites can be released immediately in the infested area. Other shipments come in such a way that the material must be carried over during the winter or at least during a season before the conditions are right for the material to be released. The ultimate object of holding this insect down to a point where it can no longer be a serious pest lies in the shipment of a sufficient sequence of parasite enemies to keep the number of the host down to a reasonable small limit.<query> when do parasites come in</query> Eventually possibly certain of the native parasites existing here, the normal beetle related species to the Japanese beetle will also attack the Japanese beetle. But the main reliance must be placed upon the known natural enemies which must be brought over. Now, it will take quite a few years before the parasites can be brought to the point where they are practically proficient in keeping this pest under reasonable control. As to removing from the class of dangerous insects, we do not stress that point very much; it may be ten to fifty years; and nobody is in position to give an estimate. Meanwhile the insect is increasing and spreading and is causing damage and is going to do more. Therefore, other important phases of our work have to do with the development of methods to control the pest, not only from the standpoint of the destruction of the parent beetle itself but also for the destruction of the grubs in the soil.<query> how long does it take to get rid of japanese beetle</query> The insect or beetle is quite resistant to the ordinary poisons such as arsenate of lead, Paris green, etc., that are commonly employed, or at least they are wise enough to know enough to let them alone. It is an open question as yet even whether beetles simply won't feed very much on arsenate of lead, for instance, or whether they will eat just enough arid know when it is well to stop. The fact remains that arsenate of lead, as a common insecticide, we have not yet been able to say will kill a large number of the beetles. It does give a certain amount of relief, but not many eases are very satisfactory in the prevention of injury to the foliage by simply driving the beetles from the sprayed trees to places where the spray is not present. That is a sort of backhanded way of getting at it and of course, if carried on continuously will, eventually devolve on the proposition of driving them from one place to another.<query> what kills beetles</query> We are working on that angle seeking to find a material which will kill a bulk of the insects which feed upon it, which is, safe to use on the foliage without resulting injury to the foliage and with which the cost of using is not excessive. From the standpoint of grub destruction we are also carrying on considerable work. It is possible to destroy the grub by using the sodium cyanide solution and spraying it or applying it to the infested soil. It will kill 90 to 95 percent of the grubs in the soil in the early fall while they are close to the surface. The drawback is the cost. The material runs from $60 to $75 per acre, not counting the cost of labor and the fact that special equipment is necessary to apply it. I believe that most of us will agree that the cost is excessive and certainly it is from the standpoint of the average farm land.<query> cost to destroy grubs</query> We are concerned, therefore, in finding a cheaper method of treatment and we believe we have found a satisfactory material in a carbon disulphide emulsion which will be satisfactory at least the two years of experimental work dealing with this material have given very satisfactory results. Another phase of the work is the quarantine. As I mentioned in the first place, we do not expect to be able to prevent the normal yearly spread of the insect, averaging between five and ten miles a year; in fact, if we had nothing but that to consider we would not have much to consider because it would take many years to go a long distance. But when we consider the fact that the insects can be spread in one year or even less, the actual spread will occur in one week through the shipment of infected nursery stock from one side of the country to the other and you realize why it is we lay so much stress upon the quarantine, a quarantine that simply restricts and controls the movement of nursery stock to places outside, does not absolutely prohibit but allows the movement only under conditions which will not spread the insect; in other words, shipments of the type which will not carry the insect are allowed, other shipments are not.<query> how long does it take for a bug to spread</query> Now, as the time is going on, it is getting a little late, I do not want to take up any more time unless you have specific questions. I will call your attention, if interested, to the circular which has been issued or printed describing the insect, its habits, etc., of which I do not have a supply with me, but if you are interested you can get copies by simply writing us for them. This is a small circular describing the insect, its habits, and giving a colored enlargement of the beetle itself, and can be secured by addressing the Japanese Beetle Laboratory at Riverton, New Jersey, or the Department of Agriculture here at Harrisburg. Now we have gone over this rather briefly and hastily. If any of you have questions I will be very glad to answer them, if possible.<query> where is the japanese beetle laboratory</query> From the publication: AACS - Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Harrisburg, PA August 20, 21, 22 and 23, 1923 Code: A1085 1920-1939 horticulture japanese beetle pest trees Add new comment Why The Cemetery Should be A Garden Date Published: September, 1920 Original Author: W.E. Groves Hamilton, Ontario Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 34th Annual Convention At first sight it may seem presumptuous to talk to an audience of this character on the subject set for me, ""Why the Cemetery Should Be a Garden”. The life business of so many of you is more or less a practical demonstration of the widely accepted principle indicated and looking at the matter from the viewpoint of a plain gardener, the best I can hope to do is to emphasize some of the apparent reasons and with special good fortune; stimulating afresh some thought along these lines.<query> when was the cemetery published</query> What is a garden? The word has probably outgrown in this country its original etymological meaning, “an enclosed space"" and might now be better described as a cultivated space especially cared for. When we recall all the thought, care and attention on devoted today to the gardens of this and other countries it is not difficult to accept this meaning. Adding to this the idea of rest, beauty, memory, faith and hope, it is not far to the great idea that is a place at once so near the human and the divine, that to very many it becomes the most hallowed spot on earth. This is not by any means a fancy picture, and I feel quite safe in the statement: ""Rest, comrades, rest and sleep The thoughts of men shall be As sentinels to keep Your rest from danger free.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> ""Your silent tents of green We deck with fragrant flowers Yours has the suffering been The memory shall be ours."" Linking up the garden idea with the cemetery, may I suggest first, that there is at least some traditional warrant for the assumption that the ""sleeping place"" should have the garden characteristic? Definite statement and perfectly permissible inference shows that again and again in the dim past the thought of garden ""enclosure"" was associated with burial. The cave in a field bought and set aside for a patriarchal burying place being used for more than one generation, at least suggests care. Again “there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulcher, there they laid him” are words covering another familiar instance of the garden tomb. Church history still further confirms the fact that for centuries the garden idea and garden care has been associated with the grounds used as last resting places.<query> what is the garden in a cemetery</query> If in these early years the results were crude, they were probably not more crude than much of the other life of the age. Horticulture in its fine development deserves to rank among any of the arts of sciences, with the result that in present day conditions we can easily find another strong reason for the statement that the cemetery should be a garden. Never in the history of the world has there been such an appreciation of and love for the beautiful in nature as there is today. Statistics on such a subject as this seem out of place, but the assertion can be easily proved by those who delight in the analytical. In this land, as well as in many others, the value of the artistic as a psychological asset is becoming a real factor in commercial life. Home life, town and city life, as well as business life demand this as a positive essential to the progress of civilization.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> Given these conditions it is not far to carry the idea to the last sleeping place, thereby claiming that to keep pace with the times the cemetery should constantly prove the presence of a real horticultural guardian. It should be artistic without being exotic, full of landscape beauty, without being a horticultural exhibition. It might well be a place where spreading lawns, shade-giving trees, blooming shrubs and the song of birds combine to make it a hallowed place for the dead, and a lovely spot for the living. Irrespective of the size of the community served a modern cemetery is almost of necessity rural. Is there not here another strong reason for the hand of the gardener where the influence on the immediate neighborhood is bound to be felt? Just as one good garden on a street is sometimes the inspiration to change the whole character of the street, the impression gathered from a real garden burial ground must be helpful in the district where it is placed.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> As an asset to the town or city there is some value due to the fact that being so often at one of its entrances the visitor gets right here his first and often most lasting impression. This point is worth mentioning, but I do not labor it; passing on to say a word or two on the more definite aspects of the subject. The cemetery should be a garden because it is a place of rest. Any student of horticulture will confirm the statement that the idea of restfulness is directly associated with gardens. The best garden planners constantly have this in mind. The glaring and the gaudy both in color and form are omitted from worth while designing, and in their place there is a striving after the harmony which means variety in unity, that peacefulness of effect, which is but another name for restfulness.<query> why is a cemetery a garden</query> Landscaping has yet to be treated in this convention and I do not intrude, but I may be allowed the statement that the tendency of the best landscape gardeners is to avoid shocks and to emphasize quietness, to put an embargo on the merely artificial, that the natural may be accentuated. A true garden brings rest to practically all the senses in the very highest degree, and because of this fact I am unhesitating in the statement that man's last earthly sleeping place in its. environment may well be the most restful of all. Sentiment if you like but one of life's sentiments that we can ill afford to miss. The association of beauty with the garden is yet another reason for the hand of the gardener in the cemetery. Beautification, merely amounting to beautification of home surroundings, is now so general that the idea has almost become an accepted principle.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> Next to the growing for food, the first thought about a garden is beauty. We have looked at this from a general point of view but is especially true of the individual. Both the garden and the grave have about them much of the personal touch and even granting that the sense of beauty does not invariably appear in the garden the call to beauty is nearly always felt in connection with the cemetery lot. Beauty of design, beauty of construction and beauty down to the smallest detail is increasingly demanded, and in these days when by common consent we pay every respect to our honored dead, beauty of surroundings surely has a place. The idea of memory in this connection is so obvious that it needs hardly more than mere mention. The tree planters of one generation call for thankful remembrance by the next from an economic point of view.<query> what is the meaning of beauty in the garden</query> The garden that counts its timely decades rather than years naturally has clustered around it the most sacred memories. Whilst the almost imperishable record in granite and marble is strikingly imposing, the memory of past generations will assuredly be sweeter if it is in part associated with trees. And if in the march of time the cemeteries of the cities reach the point where they are past serving their original purpose and to some extent become city breathing places for crowded districts, the practiced hand of the gardener will be revealed where tree and shrub, grass and flower, are blending in nature's finest harmony, the place in very truth becoming a memorial to those who have passed into the unknown. Is it too much to claim for both the garden and the cemetery that they are the homes of faith and hope? A fine text for a sermon, but I refrain from preaching.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> I am talking to men who can appreciate the idea, being so closely associated with both the aspects suggested, and I venture to submit that there is no profession on earth calling for more constant exercise of these two virtues than that of the man who plants. His hope in the eternal round of the seasons, his trust in the seed he sows, his confidence in the coming of seed-time and harvest bring him constantly close up to the miracles of growth. There is no labor in the universe bringing such reward, no work providing such thrills of joy, no occupation giving such a sense of completeness, content and blessing. And if this be so, I am bold to ask: Do I claim too much in the statement that the garden conception should be closely associated with the burial ground? If there is any real connection between nature and nature's God, surely it can be found where every bud and bloom, every leaf and twig, every branch and every tree, bears silent witness to the faith and hope of man in immortality.<query> what is the connection between the garden and the burial ground</query> And if at times the great phrase ""I am the resurrection and the Life"" fall on the ears of those too stricken to hear, the humble flower at our feet stands out in glorious confirmation. The ""sure and certain hope"" finds its eternal witness in the very blades of grass on which we stand. So I venture to submit to you this morning these simple reasons among many others for the assumption that the cemetery should be a garden. It is at once a pleasure and an honor to speak along these lines to a body of men who by intuition and training are so alive to these great facts, men whose life business it is to make easy some of the darkest hours of their fellows, men who spend their time trying to make the cemetery a fitting place for the living, as well as for the dead, men who have the touch of fine taste and are full of the finer feelings, and I am sure my appeal does not fall on deaf ears.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> The flowers of France hallowed because they grow in soil fertilized by the blood of our noblest and best-were silent witnesses to deeds of valor for the great cause of liberty and truth. Are not the same flowers a perpetual reminder as they grow in quietness round our homes and round our tombs, that man lives in deeds, not years, that high ideals and courage dignify and ennoble life, that the way of life leads through the gates of death, and that life alone is worth while which has in it the elements of chivalry, bravery, beauty and truth.

Seed of all the varieties of grasses I have named can now be had, although in some cases not free from chaff, yet, just as free from weeds as Blue Grass or White Clover. To obtain such, it naturally, follows, that a higher price has to be paid than would be the case if impure seeds were offered: but the difference in the actual cost is so small that this can hardly be considered a factor. I presume that quite a number of you will not agree with me in my conclusions. I hope, however, you will defer judgment until you have had opportunity to compare the result of a two or three kind mixture with a properly balanced lawn grass made up from six or eight varieties.

If space will permit, allow for cultivation by horse-power between the rows and ample room for two or three seasons growth, without crowding be¬tween the plants in rows. This work only requires a commencement, and in a very short time the diligent beginner will have on hand a valuable and interesting collection of plants and shrubs, native and foreign, suited to his own special wants. After the nursery is fairly started, I would recommend the purchase of a standard treatise on the general nature of plants and make a study of them; so that we may work from established principles, and fully comprehend the object of every operation performed and their cultivation.

So if there's a nutrient deficiency, where you'll see it is in the older leaves, because the plant is kind of feeding on itself. If you see new green growth and old yellow growth, it's more than likely due to a nutrient deficiency. There are also a host of minor nutrients. If you're in a place that has high rainfall, molybdenum and sulphur can become deficient—they literally get washed out of the soil. Molybdenum is necessary for plants to be able to use nitrogen. Places in the Southeast often have a molybdinum deficiency. You can replace nitrogen, but if you don't replace the micronutrients, you're not going to get full use of the fertilizer.<query> why do plants grow yellow</query> Ninety five percent or more of the problems you have in your landscape are going to be cultural. If you have good cultural practices you're not going to have these problems. Trees: Never be afraid to reject trees that come in. If you order them, you're the customer and you don't have to accept them. They grow a lot of junk out there. If the tree has a stake next to the trunk, get it off immediately. It's bad for the tree; it's tree abuse. Cutting off branches: Unfortunately, in years past, we told people to cut them off against the trunk and we did it so well that now we're having a problem trying to let people know that we told you wrong. So don't cut a limb flush. And don't paint the spot afterward, because then you seal in moisture and you can get rot.<query> what is the best way to keep a tree from growing</query> I trust I may be pardoned if I have seemed over zealous on this subject but I am sure that no set flower bed or clump of shrubbery that can be planted will receive as much admiration and praise as a well stocked lily pond.

Galloway Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 19th Annual Convention I will talk to you this afternoon in a wholly informal way and have made no attempt at preparation, but simply want to tell you in a few words something of the work that the Department of Agriculture is doing, and something of the work of the Bureau of Plant Industry, the bureau over which I have the high honor to preside, in its direct application to your own work.<query> when was the aacs convention</query> Pruning pines: I know it's really hard, especially where you have a lot of mowing, but trees are big shrubs until they become mature. And so often when you buy plants from nurseries, they're what we call ""lollipops"" a shape that will cause problems in the future. You need the limb structure to be all the way down the trunk. If you trim the branches all the way up to make it look like what we think a tree should look like, then it becomes a sail—it catches the wind and doesn't distribute it all the way through—and then you have a problem.

We have lines of work which are being conducted looking to the prevention of diseases from insects to plants and trees. We have made investigations in the methods of spraying which I need not call attention to as many bulletins have been issued on this subject. We are conducting investigations every year on the treating of plants by the application of germicides and insecticides. I do not know as I can add anything. As I indicated in the beginning, my remarks are entirely informal. I simply want to close by extending a hearty invitation for you to come and see us and if I am not there some of our people will be and will be glad to show you all there is to see.

M. Keller Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 17th Annual Convention That herbaceous plants deserve all the attention which they receive now by the best landscapers, when laying out new grounds or when called upon to alter, improve or partially replant and renovate older establishments, may not be generally admitted, still the fact remains that there are advantages in hardy plants and it is a fact that in late years thousands of these plants are employed, where twenty or thirty years ago only a few dozen were used-it is not a passing fashion for the demand is constantly growing; showing that with each year they gain in popularity and that their merits are more and more appreciated.<query> when was the aacs convention</query> Annual Convention Of all the work pertaining to horticulture there is none so difficult to write about as the planting and pruning of trees and it is almost impossible for one to learn how to do the work by reading for the fact that no two trees are alike. Whoever studies the varied beauties of trees will find that they possess almost a human interest, and their features will reveal varieties of expression, and charms of character, that dull observers cannot imagine. No tree has the highest beauty of its type without the appearance, in its whole bearing, of robust vigor. There may be peculiar charms in the decay of an old trunk, or the eccentric habit of some stunted specimen which ministers to the love of the picturesque; but tree beauty and health are as inseparable in trees as in humanity. Luxuriant vigor is, then, the essential condition of all beautiful trees but thriftiness cannot make an elm look like an oak, but rather brings into higher relief the distinguishing marks of each, making the elm more graceful and the oak more majestic.<query> what is the beauty of trees</query> It is always profitable to give time to intelligent preparation of the soil to receive the trees and to be sure that the roots are kept in a moist condition until established in the new ground, Excavate the soil from a space wide and deep enough to provide for the root growth, throw back the soil so that your trees when planted in the middle of the prepared space will have a deep, mellow bed in which to extend their roots. In planting, the tree should be set in the ground no deeper than it grew in the nursery, which depth may be determined by discoloration of the bark at the base. More trees die from this one cause than from any other. Any broken or injured roots should be pruned so that the ends be smooth. It transplanting trees I would advise liberal doses of old manure or wood ashes.<query> how deep should a tree be planted</query> It is surprising how the roots revel in ground containing such ingredients. Another important factor for quick and luxurious growth is to form basins around the trees in order to catch the water. It is, besides that, a safeguard against the lawn mower. Never allow any grass to grow near your young trees; keep the basins always free of weeds and have the soil stirred up two or three times during the summer and in winter put some short manure on to keep out the cold, and also to serve as a mulch. Be sure to have the basins large enough, never less than one foot in diameter; two feet is much better. You ask--When is the best time to plant trees and my answer is: plant whenever the weather conditions are favorable. There are so many conditions that may work out all right for the grower in a certain locality, but would be the wrong procedure in another locality.<query> when is the best time to plant trees</query> There are some pretty and useful forms of the common box (Buxus) such as naviculatis, Handsworthi and microphylla, which are quite hardy under partial shade. A recently introduced form of the laurel from the Balkan Mountains, said to be very hardy, has been under trial in the Ellwanger & Barry nursery for some years and is reported by them to be very satisfactory. As a broad-leaved evergreen this should be very important. In conclusion, outside the coniferous evergreens the number of flowering and other evergreens suitable for planting in ornamental grounds in this latitude is really not large and not sufficiently extensive, or of that nature so as to produce any marked or broad effect on our landscapes in this climate.

Davey Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 41st Annual Convention I came to tell you a little bit about the tree as a living thing.<query> what kind of trees are in the balkan mountains</query> Probably most folks do not realize that the tree is a living, breathing organism. We know it in a sort of an abstract sense, and yet we are not likely to be actively conscious of the fact that it is a living, breathing organism. As a matter of fact the tree is just as much alive as a man. It not only breaths, but it has a circulation, it digests its food, it has sex processes. The tree breathes largely through its leaves and I hope sometime all of you may take occasion to examine the leaf of a tree under a microscope. On the upper side you will see a myriad of cells or little openings into which the air penetrates just as truly as it does into the human lungs. In those cells the air is separated into its parts, the carbon dioxide is extracted from the air and is used as a part of the food material of the tree, or the plant.<query> what is the tree</query> As a matter or fact the tree is just a big plant taken by and large and the oxygen is thrown off for the benefit of man and all animal life. The process is opposite from that in our bodies. There is no bellows in the breathing process in the leaf, but the breathing is just as real and just as vital as in our bodies, and it continues as long as the leaves are green. There is also a complete circulation in the tree. Of course it doesn't move around and around rapidly in response to heart action, and yet it does run the complete course from the little hair roots down in the ground up to the leaves and back again. Just imagine you are looking at a cross section of a tree, that is the same as the top of a stump, and of course in these days when it is a popular pastime to cut trees down, you can find stumps anywhere.<query> why do trees breathe</query> Imagine you are looking at the top of a stump. In the center you see the pit that was there from the time it was a baby, around that is a layer of wood which represents the first year's growth. Around that is a second layer of wood which represents the second year's growth. Around that is a third layer of wood which represents the third year's growth, and so on to the bark. In the beginning when the tree was young and small the central cells were not only structural supports as they are all the time but they were active sap carrying tissue. The cells of a tree overlap each other and they are hollow. In the beginning when they are young there is an opening from one cell to another. So, when the tree was young and smart these central cells were active sap carrying tissue and it was through them that the sap moved upward.<query> when a tree is young and small the central cells are</query> But as the, tree grew in size the central cells became more fined up with mineral elements and therefore more dormant, so, as you go outward toward the bark you find the lust few outside layers of wood, the active sap carrying tissue in those largely. The sap travels upward from the roots to the leaves, imagine, if you will, that you had the power to take from the ground a tree and wash the dirt away from the roots. If you uprooted a tree and washed the dirt away you would see a magnificent structure, a wonderful top balanced by an equally large and magnificent root system. If the top is 50 feet across, the root area is also approximately fifty feet, and at the end of that root system largely are the little hair roots that take up the food in liquid form, send it up through the sap wood of the trunk, out to the leaves, where it undergoes a marvelous change, it is transformed, and then it comes back in the inner cells of the bark, in its digested form, depositing itself all the way down until finally some of it reaches the same little roots from whence it came—so you have a complete circulation that is active as long as the leaves are green.<query> where does sap come from</query> May I suggest that in order to have that circulation you must have leaves, because they are the vital connecting link, and that is why I suppose God Almighty put the leaves on trees. It is one of the reasons, anyway, and it is why there is such a terrible crime in chopping the tops of trees off, that I will refer to later. The digestion which occurs in the leaf is one of the most interesting things that happens in all the realms of life. I shall make bold to say that the leaf, speaking broadly, is the most important thing in the world. Of course I expect you to challenge that because it is a ridiculous thing to say that anyone thing is more important than anything else, and yet if you will bear with me I think I can make my case.<query> why are leaves important</query> In order to illustrate what I have in mind I want to relate a story that I read in the New York Times in 1921. You will remember then that the great famine was sweeping over Russia. They were starving to death literally by the hundreds of thousands. The situation was so bad that some of the big city newspapers sent their special correspondents to Russia to inquire into the situation and report by daily letter. In one of these stories I read this incident: the correspondent told how one day they came upon a house where a little child was sick on a couch, covered with a quilt, and it looked as though there were a pillow under the quilt. Its eyes were still and glassy, staring straight upward, it was all but dead. The correspondent looked at the child and looked at the mother and she divining his purpose pulled back the quilt and disclosed a horrible, misshapen body, its little stomach was horribly distended, very much like a kewpie, its arms and legs were emaciated, it was just about breathing its last.<query> when was the russian famine</query> And then she told what had happened. She said hunger had driven them so far that they had fed this child blue clay, the clay stuck to the teeth and the walls of the stomach and would for the time being stay the pangs of hunger, but there was no power in the human system to throw it off, so it lay there. Finally the worms started to work and the end was near. I tell that story realizing that there is in it a touch of horror because it illustrates and emphasizes a profound truth, there are only two minerals that man can take into his system and assimilate—water and salt, and those only in limited quantities. Everything else we eat and almost everything we wear comes to us through the leaves of vegetation. It is the leaf, speaking of vegetation generally, that takes the dead mineral elements from the soil and transforms them into living cells.<query> what two minerals can man take into his system and assimilate</query> The leaf is the one and only connecting link between the organic world and the inorganic world, meaning the world of living cells on the one hand and the world of dead mineral plants on the other. The leaf is the only thing that has the power to transform dead matter into living matter, and therefore it is the foundation of all life. No life could exist upon this earth if it were not for that vital function performed by leaves, and that is why I say the leaf is the most important thing in the world. The tree has sex processes also that are just as real and just as beautiful as in any other form of life. The male and female exist as positive factors. Sometimes you find the male and female in the same flowers, at other times in different flowers on the same tree, and sometimes the flowers of a tree are all male or all female, the pollen is created in the male parts and is carried partly by the wind and partly by insects to the female organs where conception takes place and the continuity of life is made possible.<query> why is the leaf the most important thing in the world</query>"
