In fact, the term “laptop” is really very generic. There are currently four main styles of these portable PCs, each offering something a bit different, depending upon your specific needs.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a notebook</query> Ultralights – Also known as sub-notebooks or ultraportables, this style of laptop weighs up to – but no more than – four pounds, making them ideal for travelers. The upside of an ultralight is that it doesn’t burden those who have to spend a lot of time carrying them with aching muscles, as its larger cousins often do. The downside, however, is that – in order to cut down on the size and weight – this type of laptop is so small that there’s no room for a network card or internal CD drive. In order to reap the benefits of these types of “attachments,” you’d have to bring an external CD drive and port replicator. Another negative in the scenario is that ultralights tend to be on the expensive end of the laptop spectrum.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and an ultralight</query> Notebooks – This is basically just a regular laptop, but is slightly less heavy, weighing in at four to six pounds. While it’s heavier than the smaller ultralight, it also offers more options with less fuss. Offering the flexibility of a combo bay, notebooks are designed with a large opening on the side which allows the user to plug a CD drive, floppy disk or extra battery – allowing you to access the features that you need without the burden of making room for those that aren’t needed. Standards – Commonly referred to as “regular laptops,” these weigh between six and eight pounds and offer a full range of benefits. This technological pack-mule is the best buy – dollar for dollar – when you consider the cost/performance ratio. Due to their popularity, combined with their design and usability, it’s not uncommon to find discounts on these from major manufacturers.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a combo laptop</query> Other types of laptops, which fall into more specialized categories, tend to be in the higher price ranges. The bottom line is, of the four main types of laptops, the standard is the most economical for the most reasonable amount of money. Extra Large – Although this type of laptop doesn’t yet have a technical name, it’s best to simply refer to it as “extra large,” since they weigh between eight and ten pounds and have a screen that measures at least 17 inches. In addition, the keyboard is much larger than a standard laptop, making it a more comfortable fit for those who find the keyboard of the standard laptop rather inhibitive. There are a couple of downfalls to owning this type of unit, not the least of which includes its weight. There can be a four pound difference between the weight of a standard and an extra large laptop – and that’s quite a bit, when you think about lugging it around all day.<query> what is the difference between a standard laptop and an extra large laptop</query> The other negative factor is the cost of this type of laptop. It offers a price tag that’s every bit as hefty as its weight and size. The purchase of a laptop comes down to personal preference, and there are enough styles in the laptop community to please just about everyone. For those who can’t decide and just want “a laptop,” then it’s probably better to stick to the standard model. This article was published on Monday 15 February, 2010.

The TFT top lid tilts back and down behind the base just like the iBook, there are no ports in the back, the external power plug is in the same place and when it is open, it has the same stark clean appearance of the iBook. Hey, you can’t buck a great industrial design! But, to Sony’s own design credit, their version is far more unique than Gateway’s design copy. The VX89 is as we said, great looking and a pleasure to look at. Gone are the days of only some Notebooks having great TFT displays and the rest having mediocre to poor displays.<query> what is the difference between iBook and sony vaio</query> The dividing line between the levels of Notebook LCD screen quality is now very narrow, usually determined only by pixel size, pitch, contrast ratio, and brightness. The 14.1” XGA display on the VX89 is very, very good and only the contrast ratio needs improvement. The shape of the Vaio could be best described as a wedge, very thin at the front and thicker at the back. It is a very cleaver attractive design and it makes the VX89 look smaller and thinner than it really is. While its “foot print” looks small, it’s actually less than a half-inch smaller than the HP ze5000 and though it seems wafer thin because of its wedge shape, on average, it is no thinner than the iBook. Where the VX89 clobbers the competition is in its ""featherweigh"" 4.42 lbs. ; over a pound lighter than the iBook!<query> what is the shape of the vaio</query> But at what cost? No internal CD drive or Floppy Drive and a short life battery for such a comparatively pokey processor. Wise design differences in the Vaio VX89 are a lightweight Magnesium-alloy body (this one won’t chip and flake like a certain G4 PowerBook we know of), the retention of a single Type-2 PC Card Slot (not found on an iBook, a big shame) and the best “Jog dial” scroll wheel we’ve ever used. The various available ports are scattered on the two sides of the VX89; which includes a USB 1.1, i.Link, Ethernet and RGB on theleft side, and another USB 1.1, Modem and all the sound ports on the right side. We like that there is a USB port for a mouse on the right side, but the location for it and the sound ports on the VX89 is terrible because it’s near the front, right where you’re using the mouse when working at a desk.<query> what ports are on the vaio vx89</query> The mouse cable and any sound cabling you are using are going to be in the way. Sony, move these to the back on the right side in the next version VX. Mid-market ClassComparison chart Perhaps this is becoming a trend from computer manufacturers that have proprietary FlashCards or are FlashCard pioneers, because the VX89 is the second Notebook in our review with a built-in card reader. As you’d expect from Sony, it has a Memory Stick media slot. The bundled software that comes with the Vaio VX89 is also quite impressive, take a look at thecomparison chart. Does it pass desktop muster? The Vaio VX89 is an updated version of the VX88 Notebook computer, with the most notable change being the slightly faster Pentium III 900 MHz processor. Yes that’s right, a 900 MHz Intel P-3!<query> what is the vx89</query> I have to admit that when we first saw the unit we thought for sure it would have at least a 1.5 GHz P-3; then we turned the VX89 on and ran some apps, wondering why is it so slow? We like to play around with test units and form opinions before looking at the specs, but we were still surprised at just how slow the P-3 was, that Sony chooses to put in it. It can’t be to keep temperatures down, because the 1.2 GHz P-3’s were just as cool. It couldn’t be for hours of battery life, because our tests yielded only 2 hours and 13 minutes of real world use (Sony claims 3.5 to 5 hours). We are at a loss to understand why, but this slow processor is a major killer against the VX89 being a Desktop replacement Notebook. Additionally, the Intel 82815 video chipset, even with 32 MB of RAM is a stinker at any 3D acceleration or providing flawless DVD playback.<query> how long does a sony laptop battery last</query> Sony really should have gone ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce. 802.11b WiFi connectivity is built-in and Sony has put an On/Off switch on the side of the VX89, which is a great idea for power conservation when you don’t need it. Our “high-speed touch typist” evaluator credited the Vaio VX89’s keyboard with being acceptable to above average, having very good touch feedback. Conclusions: As much as we really like the light weight, style, and some of the cleaver features on the Sony Vaio VX89, sad to say that is not a Desktop replacement Notebook. We question whether if it will make a good “TravelBook”, because you’ll have to drag along the external DVD/CD or CD Combo Drive and the Floppy Drive (since Windows users continue to claim it necessary).<query> what is the sony vaio vx89</query> With our clearly explaining to Sony's PR people that this article was to review Desktop replacement Notebooks, we can’t understand why they chose to send the VX89. The Sony NV-170, an 1.6 GHz Intel P-4 powered Notebook with an ATI Radeon 7500, would have been a much better choice for a Desktop replacement and a great Notebook.

Search form Search 15 March, 2012 China Labour Bulletin is mentioned in the following article. Copyright remains with the original publisher. March 14, 2012 By Tom Douglas Recent news stories have brought to public attention the fact that many Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, are produced in part in factories with a record of using child labour, failing to provide safe work conditions, and requiring employees to work long shifts for low wages (see, for example, here, here, here and here).<query> which is least unethical buying a pc</query> At the moment, paying more for an ethical product is not an option. But what is an option is paying more to help mitigate one’s contribution to the perpetuation of unethical practices. Those who say they are willing to pay for ethical manufacturing should, I suggest, put their money where their mouth is.

Suppose you need a new laptop, or at least, are going to buy one. Leaving aside ethical considerations, you are indifferent between getting a Mac and buying a PC laptop from one of Apple’s competitors. Which should you buy? To answer this, we need to say something more about the situation at factories run by Apple’s Chinese suppliers. Much of the attention has focused on Foxconn, which assembles the iPad and iPhone. It’s alleged that Foxconn negligence was responsible for a blast which killed two people and injured more than a dozen; that it exposes workers to toxic chemicals without adequate protection; that it requires illegal levels of overtime (often more than double the legal limit of 36 hours per month) for which it frequently does not pay in full; that it deceives potential recruits regarding pay rates; that workers are humiliated by supervisors; that workers often have to stand almost uninterrupted for a 12 hour shift; and that poor work conditions contributed to a spate of suicides at the company’s Shenzen plant in 2010.<query> who makes apple products</query> In addition, Mike Daisey, a New York performer who visited the Foxconn plant in Shenzen, reports that he met children in the age range 12-14 who were working in the plant. They told him that it was not difficult for children of their age to find employment there. There have also been problems at other Apple suppliers. For example, Catcher Technology, which makes the aluminium casings for many Apple products, was recently instructed to shut down one of its factories by the Chinese government after neighbouring residents complaint of unbearable fumes from the factory. Apple has taken some steps to improve the situation in response to recent public pressure. For example, it stepped up its own supplier-audit programme, commissioned the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to conduct an outside audit, and apparently induced Foxconn to raise the wages of its workers.<query> what is the apple factory called</query> However, questions have already been raised about the objectivity of the FLA, the scope of the wage increases, and the willingness of Apple to rectify the problems that its own audits have uncovered (see this, which is a response to this). The steps being taken by Apple may be little more than cosmetic. I take it to be obvious that Apple suppliers are behaving unethically, and that the suppliers, and Apple itself, should do much more to improve the situation. But how does this bear on consumers? Does it follow that no-one should buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac? There are two main reasons why it might be unethical to buy from a company like Apple. First, in purchasing Apple products, one encourages Apple to sustain its current practices. The greater the ‘reward’ that Apple receives, in terms of profits, the more likely it is to continue doing what it is doing.<query> why is it unethical to buy from apple</query> Of course, an individual consumer may not significantly affect the sizes of Apple’s profits and thus may not alone influence the perpetuation of current practices. But when one buys a Mac or an iPad, one is part of a collective that, as a whole helps to sustain these practices, and arguably that gives one reason not to make the purchase. Second, it might be thought that, even leaving aside the effects on our choices on future practices, buying from a company like Apple is problematic. If I buy an Apple product, I benefit from the mistreatment of Chinese workers. Perhaps I also implicitly endorse what they are doing. Arguably these connections are enough to make me complicit in Apple’s wrongdoing. If I buy from them, perhaps I become an accomplice to their mistreatment of workers. The problem is that Apple’s competitors may have similar problems in their supply chains.<query> why is buying apple problematic</query> Indeed, many of Apple’s major competitors use precisely the same suppliers. Foxconn supplies Samsung, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as Apple. Most of the recent attention on unethical practices in the Chinese electronics industry has focused on Apple, rather than its competitors. But Apple may be the main target largely because, given its size and high profit margins, it’s perceived to be in the best position to improve labour standards, not because it’s own standards are the worst. Ethical Consumer Magazine ranks Apple to be mid-table in terms of the ethics of its laptop and phone manufacturing processes, and above some of its biggest competitors, such as Samsung, Sony, HP and Toshiba. Moreover, though Apple is not doing enough to improve the situation, it arguably is doing more than most of its competitors. For example, it arguably does conduct more rigorous audits of its suppliers.<query> what is apple's main competitor</query> Perhaps, then, buying from Apple is less problematic than buying from many other electronics companies. The practices that one helps to sustain, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from Apple may be less objectionable than the practices one sustains, or becomes complicit in, when one buys from, say, Sony. Moreover, in buying from Apple one may help to encourage other firms to move to some less bad Apple-like model. On the other hand, Apple probably is in a much stronger position than other electronics companies to improve the situation, given its market power and profit margins. Moreover, it is currently under public pressure to improve the situation and is clearly feeling this pressure. And its emphasis on producing ‘feel-good’ products and claims to ‘do things differently’ only intensifies this pressure.<query> why is buying apple more problematic</query> These factors suggest that—at least at the moment—Apple may be more sensitive than others to ethically-motivated consumer decisions. If sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs were to fall dramatically due to consumer concerns about factory conditions, Apple surely could and would improve the situation. Of course, no individual consumer can bring about this change alone, but she can contribute in a small way by taking her business elsewhere. Thus, two factors seem to militate in opposing directions. A concern to buy from the least unethical manufacturers might in fact slightly count somewhat in favour of buying from Apple rather than from some of its main competitors. On the other hand, a concern to send a message where it is most likely to be heard (and to make a difference) seems to count in favour of not buying from Apple. I am not sure how these factors balance out in this particular case.<query> why is apple more ethical</query> I suppose I’m inclined to think that, other things being equal, not buying from Apple is the better thing to do, right now. (This assumes that one is going to buy from someone. Of course, not buying from anyone, might be better still.) But I do want to end with a concrete and positive suggestion. If one buys any Chinese-manufactured electronics product in current circumstances, one is likely to be encouraging some unethical labour practices. I suggest that if one does this, one at least has reason to try to mitigate that effect. How might one do this? One option might be to donate to one of the Chinese charities currently pressuring Apple and others to improve condition in their suppliers’ factories (for example, China Labor Watch orChina Labour Bulletin). Many of those who have commented on blogs discussing Apple’s worker abuses have noted that they would be prepared to pay significantly more for electronics products if they were made ethically.<query> why is it bad to buy from apple</query>"

Each lens is dominated by a wide rubberized manual zoom ring. There are marked detent positions for specific focal lengths, but there is no manual focus – that’s done in-camera. Nikon created a new Stepping Drive Motor for the CX mount, and it’s quite silent – very comparable to the full-ring motor Silent Wave on the F-mount. While the lenses have Vibration Reduction, there are no external controls – it’s all controlled in the camera by accessing a specific menu. Interestingly, there are no options to turn off VR, it’s on by default. Finally, each lens has a large button on the zoom ring – the zooms must be released from their most compact carry position in order to work correctly.<query> what is the zoom ring on a nikon camera</query> By doing so, the camera also automatically powers up. The reverse is not true – collapsing the lenses back to carry position is simply that. You’ll have to power down manually using the ON/OFF switch. Despite not having a dedicated EVF, the J1’s rear display was more than adequate to the task when composing, viewing and manipulating the camera. The display did not wash out easily, exhibited sharp and vibrant images, and had a very generous viewing angle. However the display is a drain on your battery life. With a CIPA rating of about 230 shots, the enthusiast user is going to need, not want, a second battery for maximum shoot time in the field. The lenses zoom rather smoothly, and there are no hitches or rough spots encountered. The hood on the telezoom is effective, and serves as secondary protection.<query> how many shots does a tele zoom camera take</query> Both lenses were easy to mount and dis-mount; the small size and weight complemented theNikon J1 quite nicely; it was difficult to tell at times which lens was on from a visual inspection – they’re that small and unobtrusive. The camera’s dearth of external controls has been the subject of much discussion since the 1 Series debuted. In particular, the lack of a true Function button, which could be reassigned to an often manipulated control such as ISO or White Balance, as well as an equivalent “Recent Settings” menu, would go a long way to addressing some of the concerns. In addition, the inability to disable Auto-Review of the last taken image does hamper the “flow” of shooting photos in the field. It remains to be seen if Nikon will address those changes in a future firmware revision.<query> what is the function button on a nikon camera</query> Performance In a single word – excellent. With some caveats covered below. Let’s talk about the focus capability first. There is no menu or external control to invoke Phase-Detect versus Contrast-Detect. The camera evaluates the ambient light values in the frame and decides accordingly. That “threshold” is difficult to quantify in a field-review, but you can easily tell when you’re in PD – especially if you chose Auto-Area AF – the rectangles light up and subjects immediately jump into focus – no hesitation. In fact, it felt very much like the Nikon D3100’s AutoArea AF performance. That’s not to say you’ll be replacing your D3 with this camera anytime soon – but the claim of DSLR-like focus performance is true. As light levels drop, the camera will switch to more traditional CD, which has the familiar one-step “stutter” at the end of the focusing operation to confirm the subject lock.<query> what is the focus of a nikon d3100</query> Nikon’s implementation of PD directly on-sensor is a promising innovation, and hopefully will be seen in future offerings from other makers as well. The PD is nicely complemented by a 73-point AF system – providing effective and wide coverage of the viewfinder area. You’ll be hard pressed to find a section not covered by an AF point. The CD gives you even more, with a 135-point coverage pattern. The subject really needs to have contrast under the AF point to optimize the lock-on, but overall the experience is like no other – I had the opportunity to let several other enthusiast and commercial shooters try out the camera briefly during a day-long road trip – they were all quite impressed and noted how the AF system made the camera feel very responsive for casual shooting.<query> what is af point on nikon cd</query> On the image quality side, theNikon J1 does not disappoint. Shots of the Provincetown harbor and other Cape Cod landmarks, in both rain and blue sky all reflect the color, contrast and sharpness typical of Nikon products and image processing. The Providence skyline exhibited good detail and excellent metering response, with no blowouts and good shadow detail. Colorful boats in P-Town harbor following a brief rainstorm. Nauset Light shrouded in a fast-moving storm front. Elevated perspective of the East Side, Providence R.I. Telephoto shot at 110mm max zoom (300mm equiv.) As a compact camera, theNikon J1 shines in terms of portability and convenience. With two zooms covering the most common focal lengths of 27-300mm and exhibiting a very low-profile, it was easy to pull the camera in and out of a jacket pocket for grab shots or to quickly swap lenses.<query> what is the zoom of nikon j1</query> From the forest pines of Rayce Point to the narrow alleys and beachfronts of Provincetown, it was easy to carry and yet the camera delivered some amazing wide-angles, zoom shots and close-ups. (Some samples thanks to Thomas P. Sisto) On the trail with fellow shutterbugs! Fungus close-ups from the forest floor. Monuments in the mist… Some “found” artwork patterns in a back alley… The beach at low tide… One of the advantages of ILCs is the lack of a mirror box assembly. The slap of the mirror system degrades the stability of certain exposures close to the hand-held shutter speed “danger zone.” Without that mirror challenge, your ability to hand-hold inside the zone goes up accordingly. While some of these shots lack any artistic or inspirational value, the first two frames below were at 1/4th and 1/5th respectively.<query> what is the advantage of ilc camera</query> Without VR, these types of photos would be impossible to obtain. Again, it was easy to keep theNikon J1 close at hand and keep an eye out for near-dusk and after-dark compositions. Low light Example 1 Low light Example 2 The “Superman Building” near Kennedy Plaza The Providence Statehouse at dusk Indoors, the camera’s limiting factor is based upon the CX lenses available now. The 10mm f2.8 pancake prime is a good start, but really isn’t that fast when talking about ambient light photography. In addition, the relatively low 1/60th flash synch ceiling imposes further challenges to action-freezing. The optional FT-1 adapter opens up options by allowing access to a bigger range of F-mount lenses, but the 2.7x crop factor effectively turns even a normal 50mm f1.8 into a mid-tele 135mm.<query> what is the limiting factor of a nikon j1</query> That’s great for portrait and stand-off shooters, not so good for those who prefer to get in close and wide. Despite those factors, the J1 didn’t do too badly in a typically fluorescent-lit karate studio or a restaurant interior with the slow zooms. The noise is noticeable but not objectionable, and with some NR post-process, the images can be cleaned up for reasonable size reproductions, web use or conversion to B&W. Karate studio work using the 30-110 Waiting for my breakfast! Caveats So what are the downsides? As a first-generation product, theNikon 1 Series does deliver on innovations such as PD on-sensor, as well as living up to the image quality one expects from the brand. However, it’s not that simple a proposition. Based on the design and features, the target audience is clearly the average compact P&S owner wanting to move up-tier, gaining more capability and access to interchangeable lenses.<query> what is the downside of the nikon j1</query> In that regard, the camera is a clear success. The tougher proposition is for the enthusiast - such as readers of SeriousCompacts.com. That market segment is not going to be fully satisfied by the current iteration of the 1 Series. TheNikon V1 would appeal more to the enthusiast crowd because of the integral EVF, but both models are constrained by a dearth of manual controls and limited lens system choices. That being said, this author and other photographers who had the opportunity to use the camera over the course of the evaluation all agree that if your type of photography lets you select a particular shooting mode and metering choice; the camera doesn’t get in the way. In fact, it was a liberating experience to just pay attention to the more artistic aspects of taking photos – the timing, the framing, the composition, etc.<query> what is the nikon v1 camera</query> LinkBack URL About LinkBacks Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page… Subscribe to this Thread… Search Thread Advanced Search Display Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode 03-05-2012, 06:34 PM #1 Covey22 New Member Join Date Feb 2012 Posts 2 Nikon J1 Review: A Field Report By Armando J. Heredia The Nikon 1 Series represents the long-awaited entry of a popular DSLR manufacturer into the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (ILC) market. TheNikon J1 model is the more consumer oriented version, and shares many common components and operating features with its enthusiast sibling, theNikon V1. The 1 Series stands out from the rapidly growing crowd of ILCs by a new sensor and hybrid AF system. Instead of iterating an APS-C body, Nikon chose to create a new sensor size and corresponding lens mount, an unexpected move to be sure.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> – the J1 took care of everything else. The PD AF system facilitated making the camera feel very responsive from shot-to-shot. But if you are a “fiddler” or enjoy complete and convenient access to all your camera’s controls, well, it’s going to be a tough sell. The relative lack of choices in lenses is simply a matter of time. Nikon will continue to iterate new CX mount optics, but the historic track record of times between releases doesn’t point to a quick rollout. Despite Nikon’s fine reputation for TTL flash, the onboard unit of the J1 doesn’t tie back into the larger CLS wireless system used by the DSLR product family. It’s a simple flash, period. Finally, there’s the price. At the USD599 starting point, theNikon J1 starts to bump up against the established lines at Olympus, Panasonic and Sony.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> The other manufacturers, by virtue of a head-start, enjoy advantages in price tiering, completeness of systems (i.e., lenses and accessory choices) and market penetration. At USD499, this could be a better seller. Conclusion As part of Nikon’s opening shot to the ILC market, theNikon J1 delivers on capability and performance. The Hybrid AF system really works, and the camera itself continues to live up to the manufacturer’s well-earned reputation as a leading provider of imaging technology. For compact users who are interested in moving up to a faster, higher performing camera and the potential of a larger imaging system (lenses and accessories); the J1 will satisfy. For enthusiast users, well, the only thing this author can recommend is to get down to a retail store and handle it for yourself.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> You may or may not find the dearth of controls to be inhibiting. From a cost perspective, this is where the rubber hits the road. The J1 is a first-generation model, and as such, early technology adopters have always paid a price – whether it was limited functionality, higher acquisition cost or both – to be first in line. With that philosophy, TheNikon 1 Series is priced accordingly – certainly not sky-high outrageous, but definitely not aiming to take market share based on competitive pricing. As such, buyers in general need to take a good hard look at the state of the market. The upside is that you’ll own one of the fastest and certainly one of the most innovative cameras today. The challenges will be to wait out the inevitable delay as more lenses and accessories become available, and seeing if changes in handling will occur through a firmware update.<query> what is the nikon j1</query> Overall, it’s a mixed recommendation – the Nikon J1 is great camera, but you’ll be paying a premium to have one.

She had a shocking pink 'J1' around her neck which, for some strange reason, she assumed I might like but I quickly put her straight on that!<query> what camera is used for slr</query> I spent a few minutes discussing cameras with her and pointed out that the 'V1' is a superbly designed camera which handles nicely, is unobtrusive, and 'designed' rather than styled like most of the others,...however, it is shot in it's foot by tiny sensor and MASSIVE over price being a staggering £700 here in the UK.... If I have my rate of exchange right thats about TWICE the US price!! I pointed out to her that, were nikon to make a similar camera with APS-C sensor and sensible (read; competitive) price then thye would have a showstopper on their hands. I, for one, would/will immediately change from my Sony NEX,... but as things stand why pay more for an inferior system in the same size package? I should add that the 'V1' is better designed and nicer in the hand than Sony NEX models but my minumum requirement is the APS-C sensor with 20x16 inch prints without any 'texture'...which my NEX 3 is well able to do.<query> what is the difference between nikon v1 and nex</query> ........ I don't really 'get it',....don't nikon do any market survey analysis?...or even take a look at what Sony is making? Last edited by Bugleone; 03-06-2012 at 04:11 AM.

The design choice to produce only a 10MP resolving sensor is daring. Only four native lenses currently exist for the camera – a 10mm f2.8 pancake prime (equivalent 27mm), and two consumer-grade zooms, a 10-30mm f3.5-5.6 (equivalent 27-81mm), a 30-110mm f3.8-5.6 ED (equivalent 81-297mm) telephoto and a 10-110 mm f4.5-5.6 ED (equivalent 27-297mm) superzoom with a new silent Power Drive. The latter three lenses are equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR). The feature that received the most hype at pre-launch is the hybrid AF system – Nikon was able to integrate faster-focusing Phase Detect (PD) sensors directly upon the CX imaging chip.<query> what is the nikon cx sensor</query> ( 1 2) Going cold on the E-M5 - looking at a G3.

In lower light, the 1 Series would fall back to more traditional Contrast Detect (CD) sensors which are slower but more reliable in determining subject distance. The Nikon J1 also has some consumer-oriented and value-add features such as Motion Snapshot, which combines brief video and a still of the “decisive moment;” 1080P movie capture and slow-motion video (thanks to a high frame rate continuous mode). This review evaluated the camera’s still-photography features and has scoped out video functions accordingly. Initial Impressions The size of theNikon J1 is deceiving – at first glance, it’s no bigger than most of the lower-tier Coolpix P&S models that it displaces in the Nikon product family.<query> what is the nikon j1 camera</query> The J1 body is no larger in size than a typical compact P&S such as the Coolpix L22 As befitting the consumer tier, theNikon J1 comes in a variety of colors – our evaluation model came in metallic silver with matching two-tone 10-30mm and 30-100 mm zooms. Oddly, the telephoto had a lens hood, but the short zoom did not. There are dedicated hoods for all the native lenses except for the 10mm prime. The hoods can be reverse mounted for storage and both lenses have the latest Nikon “pinch-cap” versions for easy removal. Overall, the footprint occupied by the 1 Series and the two kit lenses is relatively small. It’s not the smallest ILC in the market, but it’s quite portable even in the two-kit form. The J1 with built-in flash deployed and the 30-110’s hood mounted.<query> what is the smallest nikon lens</query> The 1 Series can best be described as “pocketable,” though you’d need a large coat pocket or a modest purse or bag. Nonetheless, when compared to the smallest Nikon DSLR currently in the market – a D3100 – you immediately get a sense of the J1’s possibilities as a “carry everywhere” unit. Note the DSLR is sporting one of the smallest lenses possible – a 50mm f1.8 prime. The J1 still retains the general advantage of a larger, albeit slower zoom. The Nikon J1 next to its larger cousin the Nikon D3100 – the smaller camera is positively svelte. The front is mostly utilitarian – a large lens release button, a mostly bare gripping area on the right side (which has handling implications) , a pair of microphone inputs above the lens mount, a white-light AF assist and an IR input window round out the left the side.<query> what is the smallest nikon camera</query> While the lenses mount and dismount in the same direction as the F-mount, veteran Nikon users will be slightly put out by the need to align the lens using the large dash mounted at 12:00 rather than the more traditional 2:00 position. The rear is dominated by the large 3” display rated at 460K dots resolution, so the output can be a bit course at times. A small switch on the upper left activates the pop-up flash, which is deployed on a rather long and spindly support arm. On the right rear, you’ll find all the controls clustered together – a dedicated Function button, a vertical toggle that doubles as a command dial and zoom, and four buttons – Display, Play, Delete and Menu surrounding a combination control circular dial and a centered OK button.<query> what is the flash button on the nikon f-mount</query> Inside of the circle is the traditional four-way controller, which is marked for specific shortcuts such AE-L/AF-L, self-timer, flash mode and Exposure Compensation. To the right of the bottom plate is the combination hatch leading to the battery and SD/SDHC/SDXC compartment. The tripod mount is wisely aligned with the lens axis. The rear view of the J1. Overall, the feel of the camera is hefty, thanks to the mostly aluminum build, but a lot of the rear fascia is plastic. Nonetheless, there are no creaks and groans – everything is quite solid and well-assembled. Handling After a few minutes use, one of the gotchas of the 1 Series becomes apparent – it’s smooth yet striking industrial design exterior lacks any gripping areas for positive handholding.<query> what is the j1 camera</query> The more expensiveV1 features a minimal vertical “bar” on the right front that acts a friction point for your forefingers, but the J1 is completely bare in this regard. Nikon sells a dedicated GR-N2000 add-on handle, but it’s hard to take seriously at almost USD70 street. Several third party grips have become available at half the cost, and seem to do a much better job. The rear is a bit tight on grip space as well, as there is a small padded area available for your thumb right next to the mode dial, but should have been placed just a little bit higher for more optimal fit. Your other hand will likely be occupied supporting under the bottom plate and the mounted manual zoom lens. That’s not to say you can’t do the “one-hand” shooting style with this camera; it’s just that you won’t be doing it that often.<query> what is the nikon j1</query>"

Sign Up Discuss in my forum Nikon Coolpix L20 Review About.com Rating 4.5 Star Rating User Rating 2 Star Rating (3 Reviews) Write a review By Kyle Schurman, About.com Guide See More About: camera reviews nikon cameras With a price around $120, the Nikon Coolpix L20 is a great value for beginning photographers. Nikon The Bottom Line Beginning photographers typically look for two things in a point and shoot camera: Ease of use and a great value (meaning a good mix of price and features). Such cameras might not do everything perfectly, but they should outperform others in their price range.<query> what is the price of nikon coolpix</query> My Nikon Coolpix L20 review shows that this point and shoot digital camera fits those two critera almost perfectly. In addition, it features excellent response times. The Coolpix L20 (MSRP: $129) has almost noshutter lag, meaning you rarely miss a spontaneous photo. Nikon has created a very nice, basic, affordable camera for beginners with the L20. Pros Low price makes L20 a great value Very easy to use Camera's response times are very fast compared to others in this price range Easy to hold and shoot with one hand Handles odd lighting conditions very well Cons 3.6X optical zoom could be larger LCD can be difficult to see in bright sunlight Close-up focus could be better Battery life could be better Description Resolution: 10.0 megapixels Optical zoom: 3.6X (38-136mm) LCD: 3.0-inch, 230,000 pixels Maximum image size: 3648 x 2736 pixels Battery: two AA size Dimensions: 2.4 x 3.8 x 1.2 inches Weight: 4.8 ounces (no battery, no memory card) Image sensor: CCD 1/2.33 in.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> Guide Review - Nikon Coolpix L20 Review Image Quality For a budget-priced camera, the Coolpix L20 produces very good image quality, much better than most sub-$150 cameras. The automatic focus, exposure, and shutter speeds are accurate the vast majority of the time, producing sharp, bright photos. The L20 shoots good photos indoors, too, which often is an Achilles' heel of bargain-priced digital cameras. The only major drawback to the Coolpix L20's image quality is in extreme close-up photos, which rarely have sharp focus. The L20 could use a ""document""scene mode. It also would be nice if the L20 had a little more than its 10.0megapixels of resolution, but most beginning photographers will be OK with this model's resolution. Performance The L20's response times are very good, especially for a camera in this price range.<query> what is the nikon coolpix l20</query> It starts quickly, and it has a good shot-to-shot response time. The L20 is very easy to use as well. One area where the Coolpix L20 suffers a little bit is in battery life. It runs from two disposable AA batteries, and it seems to run out of battery power more quickly than other AA-powered cameras, probably, in part, because of its large, 3.0-inchLCD. Its overall battery life is below average, especially compared to cameras that run fromproprietary batteries. Design Nikon has created a good-looking camera in the L20, which is available only in deep red. It's a little wider on the right-hand side, which makes it easy to hold and operate one-handed. Had Nikon included a larger optical zoom lens than the 3.6X in the L20, it would've been nice.<query> what is the battery life of a coolpix camera</query> This camera isn't great for shooting nature photos from a distance or sports across a large field. The zoom does work in movie mode, however. The L20 cannot takewide angle photos, unfortunately. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the L20 delivers in the primary areas of importance for beginning photograhers. User Reviews 1 out of 5 Cheaply made, warranty no-good with Nikon, Member HappyShoppers This camera lasted less than 6 months. Downloading pictures, the screen went haywire. It seemed to be an electro problem. The only IMAGE that would display was a cracked screen. The screen itself is not damaged, and there is not even a scratch on the camera. We are very careful with our electronics. We sent it in, as directed, to the Nikon service dept. The service dept wants $99 to fix a camera that is under warranty, and only cost $89 to begin with!<query> what is the warranty on a nikon camera</query> They said the screen is cracked, and the damage was due to a heavy impact. Absolutely not true. We pointed out the perfect condition of the camera body. Their reply? They said it must have been water damage. Again, not true. Nikon is not an upstanding company.

Comparing professional digital camera With this concept in mind, selecting the perfect digital camerato suit your needs has just gone from a Saturday afternoon in an electronics store to an extensive research campaign. With your primary objective in mind - to identify and price-shop so you get the mostcamera for your bucks – you'll want to make achecklist of the most important features to you as a professional or a "" prosumer,"" that is, an amateur possessing adequate skills to require a product with some level of professional featuresand functioning.

Once you've become acquainted with the major features of a professional level digital camera and decided upon your budget, you can then begin researching particular brands and models. As an example, the Canon EOS 20D is a great match for professionals and for advanced amateurs alike. This technical device incorporates interchangeable lenses and 8.2 megapixels, making a ""bad picture"" almost impossible to take.<query> what is the best digital camera for professional use</query> Rivaling the Canon EOS 20D is the Nikon D70. This camera also features interchangeable lenses and 6.1 megapixels, also providing excellent clarity and detail. While these two cameras offer a wealth of handy features, a number of other models will also offer professional photographers and camera enthusiasts a nice array of utilities. Look into reputable brands, compile a checklist of your most critical features and speak with others who have professional cameras, even if it means visiting a chat room, message board or forum. Before you pay for your new toy, demand a chance to test it out, even if that means window-shopping for a little while.

Sign Up Discuss in my forum Nikon Coolpix P90 Review About.com Rating 2.5 Star Rating Be the first towrite a review By Kyle Schurman, About.com Guide See More About: camera reviews nikon cameras The Coolpix P90 carries the price of an advanced point and shoot camera with the look of a DSLR. Nikon The Bottom Line I found that writing the Nikon Coolpix P90 review to be one of the most difficult camera reviews I've ever written. The P90 has a lot of nice features, including a 24X optical zoom, a tiltable 3.0-inch LCD, an easy-to-use interface, and a light-weight design that makes it easy to use.<query> what is the nikon coolpix p90</query> Unlike many sub-$400 cameras, you can use a viewfinder or the LCD to frame images. However, the P90's image quality just isn't as good as I'd like to see. It's a nice camera, but it just doesn't seem to have a good classification: It's too expensive for a point and shoot, and it doesn't offer the image quality you'd want in a DSLR. Pros 24X optical zoom is great feature Tiltable LCD is a handy feature Handgrip is very comfortable to use Can use live view or viewfinder to frame photos Very easy to use - contains few buttons Cons Close-up focus should be better Overall image quality should be better LCD can be tough to see in sunlight No possibility of using interchangeable lenses Description Resolution: 12.1 megapixels Optical zoom: 24X (26-624mm) LCD: 3.0-inch, 230,000 pixels (tiltable) Maximum image size: 4000 x 3000 pixels Battery: Li-ion (rechargable) Dimensions: 3.3 x 4.53 x 3.9 inches Weight: 16.2 ounces (body only, no battery, no memory card) Image sensor: CCD 1/2.33 in.<query> what is the zoom of the p90</query> Guide Review - Nikon Coolpix P90 Review Image Quality One of the biggest drawbacks for the Coolpix P90 is its overall image quality. The photos certainly aren't terrible, and most of them are at least average quality. However, low-light photos tend to have stray pixels and purple fringing. It also seemed to have trouble focusing properly on close-up images. The P90 offers 12.1 megapixels of resolution. When shooting at the maximum resolution, you can crop the photo down which can prevent some image-quality problems. The 24X optical zoom lens (26mm-624mm equivalent) can overcome some of the image-quality issues, too. However, if you don't need a extra-large zoom lens, there are better cameras out there in this price range in terms of image quality. Performance The overall speed of the P90 is very good, especially compared to similarly designed and priced cameras.<query> what is the resolution of nikon coolpix p90</query> You can shoot your first photo about 2 seconds after pressing the power button, and itsshot to shot delays are reasonable. The LCD can be tilted for odd-angle photos, which is handy. Measuring 3 inches diagonally, the LCD is large and sharp. However, it could be a little easier to see in bright sunlight. Design The P90's design is interesting. I found it easy to use the P90 one-handed, and its large lens helps balance the camera nicely. The lens also dominates the front panel of this model, giving it a look similar to a DSLR, even though you cannot useinterchangeable lenses with it. For a camera of its size, it's lightweight. It is very easy to use, too, with few buttons. However, it just doesn't seem like the P90 has a good segment in the market.<query> how long does it take to shoot a picture on a p90</query> Its large zoom lens is nice, but I'd almost rather spend a little more for a trueDSLR with more flexible lens options and better image quality. If you don't shoot many close-up photos, and you need the large zoom lens, theNikon P90 can be a good choice, though.

clueweb12-0310wb-29-14261,3,1,"Shun Cheung Date/Time Imprint The D3000 provides a date/time imprint feature that is popular for consumers, but this option is only available if one capturesJPEG only. There is no date imprint inRAW (NEF) images, not even in the JPEG from the RAW + JPEG basic option. The D3000 has an orientation sensor so that the imprint always appears on the lower right corner of the image, regardless of whether the camera is held horizontally or vertically. I even tried to hold the D3000 vertically in two ways, by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise as well as counter-clockwise from the horizontal position, and both vertical images have the date imprint in their respective lower right corner. However, you can neither control the location of the date imprint in the image nor move it in post-processing.<query> what is the date imprint on a d3000</query> Therefore you need to crop the image later on, you can potentially cut into the middle of the imprint and it will look very strange. Lenses With a few exceptions, almost all Nikon F-mount lenses since their introduction in 1959 can be mounted onto the D3000 to capture images, including most pre-AI (Auto Indexing) lenses from before 1977. Recent 2009 statistics show that Nikon has manufactured over 50 million F-mount lenses in the last half century. However, the D3000 can only meter with modern lenses that have a built-inCPU chip to relay aperture opening electronically to the camera body. Essentially all Nikon AF lenses plus a few late manual-focus P lenses have aCPU chip in the lens. Additionally, since the D3000 body has no built-in AF motor, only Nikon AF-S (including the earlier AF-I) and equivalent third-party lenses that have an in-lens AF motor can auto focus with the D3000.<query> what type of lens does nikon d3000 use</query> Other AF and AF-D lenses that have no motor become manual-focus only on the D3000. Shun Cheung In the US, the D3000 is only available as a kit with the 18-55mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR lens; you cannot purchase the D3000 body only. Optically this lens is good and the vibration reduction (VR) feature is a great help. The maximum aperture f5.6 on the long end is on the slow side so that a flash is pretty much required for any indoor photography. The construction is typical consumer grade with a plastic lens mount. There is no distance scale on the lens, and unlike higher-end AF-S lenses, you cannot manually override the (auto) focus when the lens is set to A (auto focus). You must manually set the lens to M (manual focus) first and the focusing ring on the front end of the lens is quite narrow.<query> what is the maximum aperture of a d3000 lens</query> For indoor work, Nikon now has a very affordable 35mm/f1.8 AF-S DX lens that is highly popular among consumerDSLR users. It is a fast lens that is small in size. The mostly plastic construction is adequate and its lens mount is metal. Its AF can be overridden manually without switching to manual focus. The main disadvantage is that it has a moderate amount of color fringing (chromatic aberration). For telephoto lenses, Nikon has an affordable 55-200mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR which is good optically but also on the slow side with a maximum aperture of f5.6 on the long (200mm) end. This lens also has a very consumer-grade plastic mount. Flash Photography The D3000 has a built-in pop-up flash that has limited power, and unlike those on higher-end models such as the D90 and D300/D300s, the D3000’s pop-up flash cannot be the NikonCLS (Creative Lighting System) master flash to control remote slaves.<query> what is the best nikon lens</query> For those who use flash frequently, they are better off with an external flash. The D3000 uses Nikon iTTL flashes such as the SB-400 and SB-600. The SB-400 is a small flash that also has limited power and cannot rotate upward for bounce flash in the vertical orientation. The SB-600 is more power and more versatile; it is larger but is still quite reasonable on the D3000’s hot shoe. There are also the more advanced SB-800 (discontinued) and SB-900 iTTL flashes, but while they are compatible with the D3000, they seem to be way too big for this small camera (especially the SB-900). See our Nikon iTTL Flash Guide for more information on Nikon flashes. Memory Cards and Batteries The D3000 uses SD memory cards and is SD-HC compatible. The D3000 is sold with the new EN-EL9s battery, which is interchangeable with the older EN-EL9.<query> what flash does nikon d3000 use</query> The new EN-EL9a is gray in color and is rated at 1080mAh, so it hold slightly more charge than the older EN-EL9: 1000mAh and black in color. During my testing, I did not use the battery to exhaustion. After some moderate use, including plenty of image review on theLCD, there still seems to be plenty of charge left. Nikon D3000 vs. D5000 Nikon introduced the D5000 a few months before the D3000. The D5000 represents a new class ofDSLR that is still compact but has more features and options similar to the higher-end D90. The D5000 uses a 12MP CMOS sensor and its ISO range is from 200 to 3200. Cameras with that sensor typically have a one-stop advantage over those that use the 10MPCCD sensor on the D3000. My side-by-side test among the D3000, D5000, and D700<query> what is the difference between nikon d5000 and d3000</query> atISO 1600 verifies that difference. (With its 12MP FX-format sensor, the D700 is another stop better than the D5000, and that is also expected.) Additionally, the D5000 has the following extra features over the D3000: Live View Movie Mode Swivel LCD, at a slightly smaller 2.7"" More Custom Settings In summary, the D5000 provides some more advanced features for more serious photographers. For example, if one prefers to captureRAW and JPEG, on the D5000 theJPEG can be of any one of the three qualities available (fine, normal and basic). The D3000 only offersRAW and JPEG basic. The D5000 has a Custom Setting menu that is similar to those on the D3, D700, D300s and D90, although it does not have nearly as many options. The simpler D3000 does not provide that menu.<query> what is the difference between d5000 and d3000</query> One thing to keep in mind is that the movie mode on the D5000 is very basic. It is certainly a nice additional feature to have, but the D5000 is still primarily a still-image camera. Conclusion Nikon has been raising the bar on their entry-level DSLRs. While the D3000 is intended to be their most affordable model, it is using a variation of the 10MP sensor and the same AF module on the D200, which was a $1699 prosumer model that was in very high demand merely a few years ago back in 2006. Meanwhile, the D3000 is conveniently small and light so that it is easy to carry around. The D3000’s small size and affordable price lead to some compromises, mainly the lack of an on-camera AF motor and some dedicated control buttons. Most owners will only use AF-S lenses on the D3000 so that they have both metering and auto focus.<query> what is the nikon d5000</query> Since Nikon now offers quite a few affordable AF-S lenses, this is not a major issue any more. For consumers who are into family, travel and children sports photography and prefer a simpleSLR with more lens selections, this is an excellent camera at a very reasonable price. For the more serious photographers who prefer more controls and user options, the D5000 and especially D90 should be better choices. In the US, currently the D3000 is only available as a kit with the 18-55mm/f3.5-5.6 AF-S VR lens. You cannot purchase a new D3000 body separately. It can be an issue if you already have that particular lens or other standard wide-to-tele zoom and don’t need another one.

Shun Cheung , August 03, 2009; 09:29 P.M. Please keep in mind that this is merely a ""first look"" review, as I have only used the D3000 for a couple of days, and I mainly used it with the 18-55mm VR lens also on loan from Nikon. That is not a lens I own myself, although its limitations are very apparent compared to the f2.8 zooms I typically use. A major issue is that I don't have a RAW converter to open D3000 NEF files yet.<query> is nikon d5000 better than d5000</query> Therefore, so far all the tests are based on JPEF files only. Later on hopefully I'll run a head-to-head comparison against my D200 with the same lenses. Bruno Vieira , August 06, 2009; 03:04 P.M. I believe we should point out that only D40 still have the awesome 1/500s flahs sync speed.... and that's a shame!! I would love if the new cameras also had it.... Vladimir Ferdman , August 06, 2009; 07:32 P.M. Will this camera work well with the older MF lenses? Will it meter, for example with the 50mm/1.8 AI or AIS lens in any of the modes? I think a big drawback to Nikon entry level DSLRs is that while they'll mount and shoot with the legacy glass, they will not meter with it, which makes the whole idea of compatibility of the mount moot.<query> what lens does nikon d40 use</query> This is where Pentax beats Nikon hands down. Most photogs with arsenal of good legacy glass and who love shooting manual focus are left in the dust. I personally don't care if the auto-focus has 3 spots or 300, but will it meter with an old (and REALLY awesome) MF lens? Shun Cheung , August 13, 2009; 05:17 P.M. The 1/500 sec on the D40 is due to its electronic shutter, which is not a good thing to have. That is why Nikon is phasing that out completely. See Joseph Wisniewski's excellent explanation here: http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00SuYs Emil Ems , August 18, 2009; 07:00 P.M. The D5000 introduced an automatic three-exposure feature, with one stop over, one stop under and one normally exposed. Since the dynamic range of the sensor is limited, this is extremely useful in high contrast situations.<query> why does nikon auto focus</query> Does the D3000 offer the same feature? Michael Weick , August 21, 2009; 09:18 A.M. Personally I don't care if an electronic shutter is not a ""good thing"" esp. if Nikon or any other manufacturer will you make believe this to sell more cameras to the uninformed. The D 40 (D50 and D 70) has the 1/500 flash sync. which makes it a more versatile camera than any other camera at the moment during sunny day light. This is better than any D3(X) or whatever. Neil Dwyer , August 31, 2009; 04:49 P.M. Thanks for the review. Very helpful, as I'm preparing to buy a Nikon DSLR & haven't selected the model. Do you know if the d3000 is compatible with a Sigma 28-105, 3.8-5.6 lens? I read that the d40, 50 & 60 won't autofocus with it, but other Nikon DSLRs will.<query> what is the nikon d3000</query> Used that lens with my N65 and would like to on the DSLR if possible. Shun Cheung , September 19, 2009; 12:09 P.M. Among all Nikon digital SLRs introduced to date (September 2009), the D40, D40x, D60, D3000 and D5000 do not have a built-in auto focus motor. Therefore, unless the lens has an AF motor built-in (known as AF-S in Nikon terminology), you will have to focus the lens manually on any one of those cameras. However, the D50 has a built-in AF motor in the camera body. James McConnell , September 22, 2009; 02:11 P.M. Good review for the most part, however: I just purchased the D3000 over the D5000 because, according to the Nikon Site, the D3000 is compatible with the Nikon Creative Lighting System, while the D5000 is not.<query> does nikon d5000 have auto focus</query> It seems the main value of the D5000 over D3000 is it's ability to do movies (rather poorly) and, of course, the ever questionable ""Live View"" feature that is so popular on most pocket cameras. The increase in megapixels doesn't mean that much, as my 6 megapixel D70 far outperformed any 10 to 12 megapixel pocket cameras I've ever seen... Again, Thanks for the review, it helped me decide. Shun Cheung , December 03, 2009; 09:49 A.M. Sorry James, all Nikon DSLRs since the 2003 D2H are compatible with the Creative Lighting System (CLS), including the D5000. Rosco Campbell , January 03, 2010; 09:59 A.M. So much dribble in these camera reviews.... so we need to know the facts on the camera's functions ok fair enough.... but why can't you guys put up a load of pictures taken by the camera with a few details on the side so we can se what it can do...not just 2 or 3 but maybe 10-15 of diffrent shooting modes would be so much welcome....<query> what is the difference between d5000 and d3000</query> Rosco. Peter Neale , September 12, 2010; 07:28 P.M. You have stated that the D3000 will mount most pre-AI lenses, yet the manual states that it will not mount any pre-AI lenses. Can you please clarify. Shun Cheung , September 12, 2010; 07:57 P.M. Peter, I suppose that Nikon officially does not want you to mount any pre-AI lenses onto the D3000, while in fact it works fine. Michael Freeman gave an excellent explanation on the Nikon Forum in the following thread: http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/00U513 Peter Neale , September 12, 2010; 09:45 P.M. Ah, thanks very much, Shun, for your prompt response. The thread you have referenced explains it very clearly. I don't yet have a D3000 (it's in the mail) and the only AF bodies I have which fit that category are the older type (D100, F75) with the switch that pushes sideways, not inwards.<query> can i use pre ai lenses on a nikon d3000 But that raises another question, which might belong in a different thread: if the purpose of that mechanism is to tell the body when the lens is on minimum aperture so that the meter will work with the lens and the aperture can be changed by thumb wheel on the body, why is that post present on lenses built long before AF (Ai/Ai-S) when bodies built in the same era (F3, FM, FE, etc) didn't have that switch? Shun Cheung , September 12, 2010; 11:05 P.M. Peter, you need to search about Nikon's ""EE Servo Coupling Post"" and its functionality during the AI/AI-S era, e.g. this article: http://www.zi.ku.dk/personal/lhhansen/photo/EE.htm Please keep in mind that Nikon is discontinuing the D3000; it is now replaced by the D3100:http://photo.net/equipment/nikon/D3100/preview/ Peter Neale , September 13, 2010; 06:49 A.M. Thanks again, Shun, for your prompt and informative answer.<query> why is the servo coupling post present on lenses built long before af</query> Yes, I am aware that the D3000 is about to be superseded by the D3100, but this D3000 is coming to me for an unbeatable price - $0.00.

It remains to be very small and light, convenient for casual photographers. One of the main weaknesses for the D40 and D60 is the Multi-CAM 530 AF module that has only 3 AF points, which do not cover the frame very well. Nikon has solved that problem on the D3000 by applying the higher-end 11-AF-point Multi-CAM 1000 AF module, previously found on the D200, D80, D90, and D5000. The D3000 uses 10MP CCD sensor that is similar to those on the Nikon D200, ( compare prices) (review), Nikon D80, (compare prices) (review), Nikon D60, ( compare prices) (review), and Nikon D40x, (compare prices) (review).<query> what is the nikon d3000</query> Its rated ISO range is from 100 to 1600 with a Hi 1 (ISO 3200) option. Typically, one can expect good highISO results up to one stop below the highest rated ISO (In this case one stop below 1600 isISO 800), and still acceptable results at the maximum (ISO 1600).

I asked my wife and some of her women friends to hold it with the 18-55mm kit lens, including a friend’s 6-year-old daughter, and they all like it very well. However, the grip on the right side of the camera body still has sufficient thickness so that people with larger hands can feel comfortable holding these small cameras. Because of the limited space on the camera, there is only one large 3"" LCD on the back, one command dial, and a few buttons. There is no top LCD to display the frame count, aperture and shutter speed; instead, they are shown on the backLCD as well as inside the viewfinder. On the top right side of the camera, there is a dial for selecting the A, S, P, and M exposure modes and the scene modes (e.g. portrait, landscape, children, sports, macro and night).<query> what is the lcd on a d3000</query> The single command dial controls both the aperture and shutter speed. In other words, the most frequently used controls are still directly available on the camera. A lot of controls that are used less frequently such as memory card formatting,ISO selection and white balance selection are only available as menu options. In a way it is less convenient for the photographer and can slow down the operation, but it seems to be a reasonable compromise for the sake of small size and therefore limlited space on the camera. The D3000 does have one programmable function button. The user has a choice on which frequently used control to assign to that button for faster selection. The D3000 uses separate zoom in and zoom out buttons to control the current image on display. If you keep on pressing onto the zoom out button, it will show the thumbnails of 4, 9, and 72 images; with another press, the D3000 will display a calendar for the current month and shows the thumbnail images captured in each day.<query> what is the function button on a d3000</query> If one keeps a lot of images in the memory cards for a long period, this feature makes it easy to review older images. New 3"" LCD Naturally, the large 3"" LCD dominates the back of the camera, and it is considerably larger than the 2.5"" version on the D40 and D60. As a result, there is not much space for everything else. The Multi-Selection pad is now pushed to the far right and is therefore a bit too close to the edge; it is slightly less convenient but not a major problem. The D3000 3""LCD has 230K dots; it displays a nice image but not as sharp as the 920K-dot version on the high-end D3, D700 and D300/D300s bodies. Nikon D40 vs. D3000 [back] New Guide Mode The D3000 has a new feature called the Guide Mode, which is selectable from the top Exposure Mode/Scene Mode dial.<query> what is the lcd on a nikon d40</query> The Guide Mode has three sections: Shoot View/Delete Set up Essentially it is an on-camera guide on how to set up the camera, e.g. ISO, white balance, file format, etc. and how to capture images either with a shallow depth of field or to freeze motion. In other words, it contains a beginner’s guide that shows you to use a large aperture to blur the background, a shutter speed around 1/200 sec to shop people motion and 1/1000 to stop vehicle motion, etc. It is convenient for early beginners, but once you learn how the aperture, shutter speed, andISO settings affect the image, you can easily decide on those settings yourself. Shun Cheung Auto Focus Since the D3000 uses the same Multi-CAM 1000 AF module as the D200, which I have owned since 2007, I am quite familiar with its strengths and weaknesses.<query> what is the guide mode on a d3000</query> On the D3000, it performs in a similar fashion. For outdoor photography under brightly lit conditions, it is very good. The Group Dynamic option is especially convenient for sports photography. However, indoors under dim light, only the center AF point that is of cross type is highly effective. If you use any one of the other 10 line type AF point, you may experience some AF “hunting” under low light. High-ISO Results Similar to the Nikon D200, D80, D40x, and D60, the 10MP CCD sensor Nikon uses gives good highISO results up to about 800. If there is sufficient light, ISO 1600 is still fair, but under very dim light, the resulting image becomes noisy. You lose about 1 stop of highISO capability compared to the newer 12MP CMOS sensor on the D300/D300s, D90 and D5000.<query> what is the highest iso for nikon d300</query>"

Email Share Close del.icio.us Digg Facebook reddit StumbleUpon Twitter E-mail It Recipients' Email Address: Your Name: Your Email Address: NOTE:<query> what should you really eat</query> The guidelines say that it's okay to eat up to half of our bread, cereal, rice, pasta, and other grain foods in their fiber- and nutrient-depleted, refined forms. That’s unfortunate, because in the body, refined grains like white bread and white rice act just like sugar. Over time, eating too much of these refined grain foods can make it harder to control weight, and can raise the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Too lenient on red meat and processed meat. High intakes of red meat, such as beef, pork, and lamb, are associated with a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. (4-6) Yet nowhere in the guidelines does it say to limit red meat. The guidelines also don't give adequate warning about the hazards of processed meats, such as bacon and hot dogs, which are even more strongly linked to heart disease and diabetes.<query> foods that raise risk of diabetes</query> Too much dairy. The guidelines’ recommendation to increase the intake of low-fat milk and dairy products seems to reflect the interests of the powerful dairy industry more so than the latest science. There is little, if any, evidence that eating dairy prevents osteoporosis or fractures, and there is considerable evidence that high dairy product consumption is associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. (Read more aboutcalcium, milk and health.) The Problems with MyPyramid and MyPlate Distilling nutrition advice into a pyramid has its merits: The shape immediately suggests that some foods are good and should be eaten often, and that others aren't so good and should be eaten only occasionally. The layers represent major food groups that contribute to the total diet. MyPyramid tried to do this in an abstract way, without any text or food images on it, and failed.<query> why is dairy bad for you</query> And it forced people to go to a Web site to learn what they should eat. (Read more about theproblems with MyPyramid and its predecessor, the original Food Guide Pyramid.) The MyPlate icon is an improvement over MyPyramid: It shows a circle divided into four brightly-colored wedges, each labeled with the name of a food group. Vegetables (green) and fruits (red) take up half the plate. Proteins (purple) and grains (brown) each get one quarter of the plate. Just off to the side is a smaller blue circle for dairy products, looking a bit like a glass of milk or a cup of yogurt. A fork and placemat complete the place setting. The MyPlate icon nudges Americans to put more produce on their plates, but it still falls short on giving people all the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> what is the food icon on myplate</query> And as a shorthand version of the US government’s nutrition advice, MyPlate suffers from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010’s shortcomings, as well. MyPlate does not show that whole grains are a better choice than refined grains, for example, or that beans, nuts, fish, and chicken are healthier choices than red meat. Healthy fats—key to heart health and to lowering the risk of diabetes—do not appear at all on the plate or the table. Yet dairy is given a prominent place right next to the plate, despite evidence that high intakes of dairy products do not reduce the risk of osteoporosis and may increase the risk of some chronic diseases. Perhaps the greatest problem is that MyPlate is silent on the large portion of the US diet that's junk: sugary drinks, sweets, salty processed foods, refined grains, and the like.<query> what is myplate</query> Building a Better Pyramid and Plate If the only goal of the USDA's food icons is to give us the best possible advice for healthy eating, then they should be grounded in the evidence and be independent of commercial interests. Instead of waiting for this to happen, nutrition experts from the Harvard School of Public Health created the Healthy Eating Pyramid, and updated it in 2008. And in September 2011, working with colleagues at Harvard Health Publications, they created the Healthy Eating Plate. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the best available scientific evidence about the links between diet and health. They fix fundamental flaws in the USDA food pyramids and plate and offer sound information to help people make better choices about what to eat. (View a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Pyramid, in a separate window; view a large PDF image of theHealthy Eating Plate, in a separate window.) The Healthy Eating Pyramid The Healthy Eating Pyramid sits on a foundation of daily exercise and weight control.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Why? These two related elements strongly influence your chances of staying healthy. They also affect what you eat and how your food affects you. Exercise and weight control are also linked through the simple rule of energy balance: Weight change = calories in – calories out. If you burn as many calories as you take in each day, there's nothing left over for storage in fat cells, and weight remains the same. Eat more than you burn, though, and you end up adding fat and pounds. Regular exercise can help you control your weight, and it is a key part of any weight-loss effort. The other bricks of the Healthy Eating Pyramid include the following: Whole Grains Read more about whole grains. The body uses carbohydrates mainly for energy, and it can get them from many sources—some healthful (beans, vegetables, fruit, whole grains), and some not (sugary sodas and other drinks, sweets).<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The best grain sources of carbohydrates are whole grains such as oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and brown rice. They deliver the outer (bran) and inner (germ) layers along with energy-rich starch. The body can't digest whole grains as quickly as it can highly processed carbohydrates such as white flour. This keeps blood sugar and insulin levels from rising, then falling, too quickly. Better control of blood sugar and insulin can keep hunger at bay and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Healthy Fats and Oils Read more about healthy fats. Surprised that the Healthy Eating Pyramid puts some fats near the base, indicating they are okay to eat? Although this recommendation seems to go against conventional wisdom, it's exactly in line with the evidence and with common eating habits.<query> what is the best source of carbohydrates for diabetes</query> The average American gets one-third or more of his or her daily calories from fats, so placing them near the foundation of the pyramid makes sense. Note, though, that it specifically mentions healthy fats and oils, not all types of fat. Good sources of healthy unsaturated fats include olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and other vegetable oils; trans fat–free margarines; nuts, seeds, and avocados; and fatty fish such as salmon. These healthy fats not only improve cholesterol levels (when eaten in place of highly processed carbohydrates), but the fats in fish can also protect the heart from sudden and potentially deadly rhythm problems. Vegetables and Fruits Read more about veggies and fruits. A diet rich in vegetables and fruits has bountiful benefits. Among them: It can decrease the chances of having a heart attack or stroke; possibly protect against some types of cancers; lower blood pressure; help you avoid the painful intestinal ailment called diverticulitis; guard against cataract and macular degeneration, the major causes of vision loss among people over age 65; and add variety to your diet and wake up your palate.<query> what foods are healthy</query> On the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes don’t count as a vegetable, since they are chock full of rapidly digested starch, and they have the same effect on blood sugar as refined grains and sweets. That’s why potatoes are in the “Use Sparingly” tip. Nuts, Seeds, Beans, and Tofu Read more about healthy protein. These plant foods are excellent sources of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Beans include black beans, navy beans, garbanzos, lentils, and other beans that are usually sold dried. Many kinds of nuts contain healthy fats, and packages of some varieties (almonds, walnuts, pecans, peanuts, hazelnuts, and pistachios) can carry a label saying they're good for your heart. Eating nuts and beans in place of red meat or processed meat can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Fish, Poultry, and Eggs Read more about omega 3s.<query> what foods are good for your heart</query> These foods are also important sources of protein. A wealth of research suggests that eating fish can reduce the risk of heart disease, since fish is rich in heart-healthy omega-3 fats. Chicken and turkey are also good sources of protein and can be low in saturated fat. Eggs, which have long been demonized because they contain fairly high levels of cholesterol, aren't as bad as they've been cracked up to be. In fact, an egg is a much better breakfast than a doughnut cooked in an oil rich in trans fats or a bagel made from refined flour. People with diabetes or heart disease should limit their egg yolk consumption to no more than three a week; they can try egg whites, instead, which are very high in protein and are a fine substitute for whole eggs in omelets and baking.<query> what is the best breakfast for diabetics</query> Recipients' Email Address currently accepts only 5 email addresses separated by commas.

Building bone and keeping it strong takes calcium, vitamin D, exercise, and a whole lot more. So why does the Healthy Eating Pyramid recommend limiting dairy products, which have traditionally been Americans' main source of calcium and vitamin D? Because most people need more vitamin D than they can get from drinking three glasses of milk—and they need less calcium than three glasses of milk provide. Though there are some health benefits from modest dairy intake, high dairy intakes are associated with increased risk of fatal prostate and maybe ovarian cancers. There are other healthier ways to get calcium than from milk and cheese, which can contain a lot of saturated fat; cheese is also high in sodium. If you enjoy dairy foods, stick to one to two servings a day; you may also need to take a multivitamin or vitamin D supplement to get enough vitamin D. If you don't like dairy products, taking a vitamin D and calcium supplement (or taking the right multivitamin) offers an easy and inexpensive way to meet your needs for these micronutrients.<query> what is the best food to eat to get calcium</query> Use Sparingly: Red Meat, Processed Meat, and Butter These foods sit at the top of the Healthy Eating Pyramid because they contain lots of saturated fat. Processed meats, such as bacon, hot dogs, and deli meats are also very high in added sodium. Eating a lot of red meat and processed meat has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. So it’s best to avoid processed meat, and to limit red meat to no more than twice a week. Switching to fish, chicken, nuts, or beans in place of red meat and processed meat can improve cholesterol levels and can lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes. So can switching from butter to olive oil. And eating fish has other benefits for the heart. Use Sparingly: Refined Grains—White Bread, Rice, and Pasta; Potatoes; Sugary Drinks and Sweets; Salt Read more about carbohydrates.<query> what to eat to lower cholesterol</query> Why are these all-American staples at the top, rather than the bottom, of the Healthy Eating Pyramid? White bread, white rice, white pasta, other refined grains, potatoes, sugary drinks, and sweets can cause fast and furious increases in blood sugar that can lead to weight gain, diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic disorders. Whole grains cause slower, steadier increases in blood sugar that don't overwhelm the body's ability to handle carbohydrate. Read more about salt and sodium. The salt shaker should be used sparingly, based on extensive research linking high-sodium diets to increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Since most of the sodium in our diets comes from processed foods, such as cheese, breads, deli meats, spaghetti with sauce, and food prepared away from home, make sure to compare food labels and choose foods with the lowest sodium values.<query> foods that cause fasting blood sugar</query> Multivitamin with Extra Vitamin D (for Most People) Read more about vitamins. A daily multivitamin, multimineral supplement offers a kind of nutritional backup, especially when it includes some extra vitamin D. While a multivitamin can't in any way replace healthy eating, or make up for unhealthy eating, it can fill in the nutrient holes that may sometimes affect even the most careful eaters. You don't need an expensive name-brand or designer vitamin. Look for a multivitamin that meets the requirements of the USP (U.S. Pharmacopeia), an organization that sets standards for drugs and supplements. A standard, store-brand, RDA-level one is fine for most nutrients—except vitamin D. In addition to its bone-health benefits, there's growing evidence that getting some extra vitamin D can help lower the risk of colon and breast cancer.<query> what vitamins are good for you</query> Aim for getting at least 800 to 1,000 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day; multiple vitamins are now available with this amount. (Many people, especially those who spend the winter in the northern U.S. or have darker skin, will need extra vitamin D, often a total of 2,000 IU per day or more, to bring their blood levels up to an adequate range. If you fall into one of these groups, which would include most of the U.S. population, taking 2,000 IU is reasonable and well within the safe range. As always, it’s a good idea to discuss use of supplements with your doctor, and he or she may want to order a vitamin D blood test.) Optional: Alcohol in Moderation (Not for Everyone) Read more about alcohol. Scores of studies suggest that having an alcoholic drink a day lowers the risk of heart disease.<query> how much vitamin d should i take a day</query> Moderation is clearly important, since alcohol has risks as well as benefits. For men, a good balance point is one to two drinks a day; in general, however, the risks of drinking, even in moderation, exceed benefits until middle age. For women, it's at most one drink a day; women should avoid alcohol during pregnancy. Focus on Food Quality You'll notice that the Healthy Eating Pyramid does not give specific advice about the numbers of cups or ounces to have each day of specific foods. That's because it's not meant to be a rigid road map, and the amounts can vary depending on your body size and physical activity. It's a simple, general, flexible guide to how you should eat when you eat. To follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid, there's just one basic guideline to remember: A healthy diet includes more foods from the base of the pyramid than from the higher levels of the pyramid.<query> how many ounces of alcohol should i drink a day</query> Within this guideline, however, there's plenty of flexibility for different styles of eating and different food choices. A vegetarian can follow the Healthy Eating Pyramid by emphasizing nuts, beans, and other plant sources of protein, and choosing non-dairy sources of calcium and vitamin D; someone who eats animal products can choose fish or chicken for protein, with occasional red meat. Choosing a variety of fresh, whole foods from all the food groups below the ""Use Sparingly"" category in the Healthy Eating Pyramid will ensure that you get the nutrients you need. It will also dramatically lower your salt intake, since most of the salt in the U.S. diet lurks in processed food—canned soups, frozen dinners, deli meats, snack chips, and the like. Perhaps the only foods that are truly off-limits are foods that contain trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils.<query> what to eat on the healthy eating pyramid</query> Luckily, in the U.S. and Canada, trans fats must be listed on nutrition labels. More and more food manufacturers, restaurants, and even entire communities are going trans fat–free, making it easier to avoid this health-damaging type of fat. The Healthy Eating Plate When it’s time for dinner, most of us eat off of a plate. So think of the Healthy Eating Plate as a blueprint for a typical meal, for yourself and your family. It’s similar in concept to MyPlate, with colorful quadrants reserved for vegetables (green), fruits (red), protein (orange), and grains (brown). But unlike MyPlate, it offers important messages about diet quality, not just quantity: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. The more color, and the more variety, the better.<query> what is the healthy eating plate</query> Most Americans don't get enough vegetables, especially the dark green and red-orange types, or fruits. On the Healthy Eating Plate, just like the Healthy Eating Pyramid, potatoes and French fries don't count as vegetables. Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains—not just any grains:MyPlate tells you to reserve a quarter of your plate for grains. But grains arenot essential for good health. What’s essential is to make any grains you eatwhole grains, since these have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than refined grains. Whole grains include whole wheat, brown rice, oats, barley, and the like, as well as foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta. The less processed the whole grains, the better: Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested, and in turn, has a greater impact on blood sugar than more coarsely ground or intact grains.<query> what to eat to lower blood sugar</query> So choose steel cut oats instead of instant, sugared oats or choose whole wheatberries instead of whole wheat bread. Pick a healthy source of protein to fill one quarter of your plate: On MyPlate, the “protein” quadrant of the plate could be filled with a hamburger or hot dog. The Healthy Eating Plate, in contrast, acknowledges that some protein sources (fish, chicken, beans, nuts) are healthier than others (red meat and processed meat). Enjoy healthy fats. The glass bottle near the Healthy Eating Plate is a reminder to use healthy oils, like olive and canola, in cooking, on salad, and at the table. Limit butter, and avoid unhealthy trans fats. Though the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 acknowledges that Americans need to consume more plant oils, these healthy oils are nowhere to be found on MyPlate.<query> what is healthy eating plate</query> This simple illustration conveyed in a flash what the USDA said were the elements of a healthy diet. The Pyramid was taught in schools, appeared in countless media articles and brochures, and was plastered on cereal boxes and food labels.

Lower Salt & Sodium, A Key to Good Health Alcohol: Balancing Risk and Benefit Tragically, the information embodied in this pyramid didn't point the way to healthy eating.<query> what is the healthy eating plate</query> Drink water, coffee or tea. On the Healthy Eating Plate, complete your meal with a glass of water, or if you like, a cup of tea orcoffee (which also are low calorie and have health benefits)—not the glass of milk that MyPlate recommends. (Questions about caffeine and kids? Read more.) Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day and limit juice to a small glass per day. Skip the sugary drinks. Stay active. The figure scampering across the bottom of the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Since two out of three U.S. adults and one in three children are overweight or obese, one thing is clear: Many of us have been choosing plates that are too large.<query> what to eat on a healthy eating plate</query> Using the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate complement each other. Both emphasize foods that promote good health. And both encourage people to limit or avoid foods and drinks that are harmful, or that provide lots of calories but have little nutritional value. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery list: Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy oils, and healthy proteins like nuts, beans, fish, and chicken should make it into your shopping cart every week. Add a little yogurt or milk if you like. Skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. Let the Healthy Eating Plate be your guide to planning a healthy, balanced meal and serving it on a dinner plate—or packing it in a lunch box.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> Put a copy on the refrigerator at home or at work, to give you a visual guide to portioning out a healthy plate, and a reminder to pump up the produce. The Healthy Eating Pyramid also addresses other aspects of a healthy lifestyle—exercise, weight control, vitamin D and multivitamin supplements, and moderation in alcohol for people who drink—so it’s a useful tool for health professionals and health educators. Other Alternatives to MyPlate The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the companion Healthy Eating Plate summarize the best dietary information available today. They aren’t set in stone, though, because nutrition researchers will undoubtedly turn up new information in the years ahead. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate will change to reflect important new evidence. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate aren't the only alternatives to the USDA's MyPlate.<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> The Asian, Latin, Mediterranean, and vegetarian pyramids promoted by Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust are also good, evidence-based guides for healthy eating. The Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate take advantage of even more extensive research and offer a broader guide that is not based on a specific culture. The original Healthy Eating Pyramid is described in greater detail inEat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating, by Walter C. Willett, M.D. (the Fredrick John Stare Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Departments of Nutrition and Epidemiology at Harvard School of Public Health) with Patrick J. Skerrett (published by Simon & Schuster, 2001, and Free Press, 2005). Evidence that Following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate Lowers Disease Risk What’s the payoff for following the Healthy Eating Pyramid and Healthy Eating Plate?<query> what is the healthy eating pyramid</query> A lower risk of heart disease and premature death, according to research done at Harvard School of Public Health and elsewhere. (7- 9) Back in the 1990s, the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion created the Healthy Eating Index ""to measure how well American diets conform to recommended healthy eating patterns."" (10) A score of 100 meant following the federal recommendations (including those of the original USDA Food Guide Pyramid) to the letter while a score of 0 meant totally ignoring them. To see how well the principles embodied in the Healthy Eating Pyramid stacked up against the government's advice, Harvard School of Public Health researchers created an Alternate Healthy Eating Index with a scoring system similar to the USDA's index. They then compared the two indexes, using information about daily diets collected from more than 100,000 female nurses and male health professionals taking part in two long-term studies.<query> what is the usda food guide pyramid</query> Men who scored highest on the USDA's original Healthy Eating Index (meaning their diets most closely followed federal recommendations) reduced their overall risk of developing heart disease, cancer, or other chronic disease by 11 percent over 8 to 12 years of follow-up compared to those who scored lowest. Women who most closely followed the government's recommendations were only 3 percent less likely to have developed a chronic disease. (6) In comparison, scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index created at the Harvard School of Public Health did appear to correlate more closely with better health in both sexes. Men with high scores (those whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines) were 20 percent less likely to have developed a major chronic disease than those with low scores. Women with high scores lowered their overall risk by 11 percent.<query> what is the usda healthy eating index</query> Men whose diets most closely followed the Healthy Eating Pyramid lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease by almost 40 percent; women with high scores lowered their risk by almost 30 percent. Two recent studies offer further evidence of the disease prevention benefits that accrue from following a diet similar to the Healthy Eating Pyramid: A study that tracked 7,319 British civil servants for 18 years found that men and women with the highest scores on the Alternate Healthy Eating Index had a 25 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 42 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease, than people with the lowest scores. (7) Another observational study in 93,676 post-menopausal women found that following a Healthy Eating Pyramid–style diet (as measured by adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) was superior to following a low-fat diet at lowering cardiovascular disease and heart failure risk.<query> what is the benefit of the healthy eating pyramid</query> (8) References 1.

Its blueprint was based on shaky scientific evidence, and it barely changed over the years to reflect major advances in our understanding of the connection between diet and health. The USDA retired the Food Guide Pyramid in 2005 and replaced it with MyPyramid—basically the old Pyramid turned on its side, sans any explanatory text. Critics lambasted the symbol from the get-go for being vague and confusing. So in June 2011, with great fanfare, the USDA replaced its much-maligned MyPyramid with a new simpler food icon, the fruit-and-vegetable rich MyPlate. The good news is that these changes have dismantled and buried the original, flawed Food Guide Pyramid and its underwhelming MyPyramid successor. The bad news is that the new MyPlate icon, while an improvement over the Food Guide Pyramid and MyPyramid, still falls short on giving people the nutrition advice they need to choose the healthiest diets.<query> when was the food pyramid replaced</query> As an alternative to the USDA's nutrition advice, faculty members at the Harvard School of Public Health built the Healthy Eating Pyramid. It resembles the USDA's old pyramids in shape only. The Healthy Eating Pyramid takes into consideration, and puts into perspective, the wealth of research conducted during the last 20 years that has reshaped the definition of healthy eating. Now it's time to translate that research to your dinner plate: the Healthy Eating Plate. Just as the Healthy Eating Pyramid rectifies the mistakes of the USDA's food pyramids, the Healthy Eating Plate fixes the flaws in USDA's MyPlate. Both the Healthy Eating Pyramid and the Healthy Eating Plate are based on the latest science about how our food, drink, and activity choices affect our health. Building MyPyramid and MyPlate In the children's book Who Built the Pyramid?, (1) different people take credit for building the once-grand Egyptian pyramid of Senwosret.<query> who built the healthy eating pyramid</query> King Senwosret, of course, claims the honor. But so does his architect, the quarry master, the stonecutters, slaves, and the boys who carried water to the workers. The USDA's pyramids and MyPlate also had many builders. Some are obvious—USDA scientists, nutrition experts, staff members, and consultants. Others aren't. Intense lobbying efforts from a variety of food industries also helped shape the pyramid and the plate. In theory, the USDA’s food icons should reflect the nutrition advice assembled in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. According to the USDA, the guidelines ""provide authoritative advice for people two years and older about how good dietary habits can promote health and reduce risk for major chronic diseases."" This document, which by law must be considered for revision every five years, aims to offer sound nutrition advice that corresponds to the latest scientific research.<query> who were the builders of the usda pyramids</query> The government seeks advice from a scientific panel, one that must include nutrition experts who are leaders in pediatrics, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and public health. Selecting the panelists is no easy task, and is subject to intense lobbying from organizations such as the National Dairy Council, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Soft Drink Association, the American Meat Institute, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Salt Institute, and the Wheat Foods Council. (2) The scientific panel generates a report of 400 or so pages of dense nutrition-speak. The USDA and US Department of Health and Human Services use this report to prepare the 100-page Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The process, however, is less than transparent. And the folks who actually write the final guidelines don't always hew to the scientific panel's recommendations.<query> who is the scientific panel</query> The hefty Dietary Guidelines for Americans document is translated into a reader-friendly brochure aimed at helping the average person choose a balanced and healthy diet. Of far greater importance, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans set the standards for all federal nutrition programs, including the school lunch program, and help determine what food products Americans buy. In other words, the guidelines influence how billions of dollars are spent each year. So even minor changes can hurt or help a food industry and can also have a substantial impact on the health of Americans. Dietary Guidelines in the 21st Century: Progress, Not Perfection The Dietary Guidelines for Americans evolve with each new version. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 continues this trend of routine updates. ( 3) It also continues to reflect the tense interplay of science and the powerful food industry.<query> what is the purpose of the dietary guidelines for americans</query> Several of the recommendations in the current version represent important steps in the right direction: Move to a plant-based diet. The guidelines emphasize eating more foods from plants, such as vegetables and beans, whole grains, and nuts. Choose fish twice a week. They encourage Americans to eat more seafood in place of red meat or poultry, acknowledging its special benefits for the heart. Not all proteins are equally healthy. They recognize that some protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, and eggs, are higher in so-called “solid fats”—the saturated and trans fats that Americans need to cut back on—and recommend replacing them with fish and nuts, or choosing leaner forms of protein. Other recommendations do not go far enough to reflect the latest nutrition science—or bury key messages: Too lax on refined grains.<query> what is the best food to eat for a healthy heart</query>"

Raw Food Videos Food Journal Raw Food Store Raw Recipe Books Tuesday, March 30th, 2010 How To Break The Caffeine Addiction! For Good! by Kristen in caffeine addiction, green juice, teeccino, toddy maker Here is a common question that comes up when I’m chatting with people about the Raw food lifestyle. What If I’m Addicted to Caffeine? No problem! Been there, done that, when it comes to caffeine. Boy, do I remember the days… working long hours, drinking 2 – 3(!) triple shot (espresso) soy cappuccinos. Yikes! I’m surprised my adrenal glands are even functioning any more. Better late than never though.<query> when is raw food</query> Raw chocolate is satiating, delicious, gives you energy, and is full of anti-oxidants. REST & ADEQUATE SLEEP! I can’t emphasize enough that getting enough sleep at night (and rest) is one of the big keys for helping to maintain great energy levels so you don’t feel the need to reach for caffeine. I realize that it’s not always possible to do this in our hectic lives, but TRY! Your health is worth it. Set a schedule for yourself. Decide a plan of attack for eliminating coffee from your diet and write it on your calendar. Try the different methods outlined above for ease and success, and enjoy the healthy transition. You’ll be so glad you did it. Remember, part of the addiction is the experience associated with consumption (such as going to a cafe or wrapping your hands around a big, warm mug), so look for surrogates—ways to replicate the experience without the caffeine.<query> how to get rid of caffeine</query> Find new places and new cafes and wrap your hands around a big mug of green smoothie, warm herbal tea, or yummy Teeccino. Updated thoughts: Now that I’ve broken the caffeine addiction, I can enjoy a cup here and there (when not pregnant or breastfeeding) and not feel guilty about it, or worry about it for that matter. I keep it organic when possible. Usually decaf. There are some things that give you a psychological edge… a spiritual uplift that can be worth their weight in health gold. If having a cup of organic, fresh brewed coffee is that for you, then so be it. It would be my recommendation that it’s not something you consume tons of… keep it in moderation or as a treat – and try some of the other options I mentioned above to help reduce the dependance.<query> what to drink to break the caffeine addiction</query> Personally, I love my new relationships with Teeccino and herbal teas – thankfully, in spite of it being bumpy at first. Although the heart break was severe when I initially said good-bye to coffee/caffeine, my experience now is much healthier and balanced. Moreover, I have concerns about coffee production and the environment, which I haven’t looked into a whole lot yet, but I’ve seen snippets here and there about its problems. I plan on diving into that soon and seeing how bad it is (I’ll be reporting on this over atGreen Mommy Blog). I have heard that shade-grown, organic, fair-trade is at least better (for health and environment), but I don’t know how much. Similar Posts: Some Like It Hot!

Today, I received a great question and I thought I’d share it (along with my response) in case anyone else has this issue. Your recipe for your buckwheat biscuits sounds very good. However, I don’t own a juicer. What could I use instead of the carrot juice pulp? Love your blog. Here are some ideas to consider… Is there a juicing (or health food) store that you could go to and order a carrot juice, and ask for the pulp in a separate cup? (Remember you need 1.5 cups gently packed.)<query> what to use instead of carrot juice</query> If you have a blender, you can blend some carrots with a little bit of water. Strain out the juice and the pulp will be left in the bag. You need a nut milk bag for this, or go to the hardware store and buy a paint strainer bag for much cheaper. Cheese cloth could work, but it’ll likely get messy. The last option would be to use a cup or so of chopped carrots. It won’t be entirely the same, but I imagine they’ll turn out. :) Similar Posts: High Raw, All Vegan Food Intake – Monday How to Make Green Juice Pulp Crackers, Raw Vegan: (Video) Rainbow Juice Review: Rejuvenative Foods How to Make Raw Vegan Almond (Nut) Milk – Step By Step 12 Comments Bookmark on Delicious Digg this post Recommend on Facebook share via Reddit Share with Stumblers Tweet about it Print for later Bookmark in Browser Tell a friend ~ Monday, March 22nd, 2010 Kristen’s Raw 21st<query> how to make raw vegan snacks</query> Awesome Giveaway – FREE VEGAN PROTEIN GRENADES! by Kristen in awesome giveaway, protein grenade, sirova Wowee!

This can be a very enjoyable type of workout and will also provide a number of fitness benefits. For many people it will not even feel like they are doing a workout at all, therefore is a great resource to turn to when you’re just plain bored with your classic gym routine. Here are some of the main benefits you’ll get from trampolining. Extreme Stomach Strengthening One of the biggest benefits you’ll get with regular trampoline sessions is a great abdominal core workout. If you’re searching for a six pack, this is one exercise type you won’t want to miss. Each and every time you rebound into the air your body will have to tighten up to support yourself for landing, which will primarily be accomplished by the abdominal muscles tensing up.<query> benefits of trampolining</query> This constant tensing-relaxing cycle is enough to help strengthen the core and also improve posture in the process. In fact, the abdominal muscles are going to be called into play to a larger extent during trampolining than in most of the boring sit-up movements you may have performed in the past. Low Impact The second big benefit of adding trampolining to your workout program is that it is very low in overall impact. You may have thought the opposite – after all, you are rebounding up and into the air, but remember that because you are heavily cushioned when you land back on the trampoline, this takes much of the pressure right off the joints. If you usually suffer from knee pain during normal exercise such as running or biking, this is a good substitution. Lymph System Improvements A third nice benefit of trampolining is that it tends to help out with lymph system drainage.<query> benefits of trampolining</query> This will aid with the removal of any toxins or other poisoning substances that may be present in the body, ensuring that your immune system stays nice and strong. Cardiovascular Benefits One of the most common goals of any fitness program is to enhance your overall cardiovascular system. This is what ensures that your heart stays working effectively and that you have blood pressure readings that are within the healthy range. If you can keep up with your trampolining for a good twenty to thirty minutes you will get these cardiovascular benefits and also help to enhance fat loss as well. It is a very calorie demanding activity if you are continually jumping up and down and you can almost burn as much as you would if you were skipping. Bone Strengthening Benefits Maintaining strong bones is also an essential element for promoting good health and being able to stay active for many years to come and trampolining will also help you accomplish this task. Any weight bearing activity is often regarded as bone strengthening and since each and every time you jump up and down on that trampoline you will be bearing your weight, it is just as effective as running would be.<query> benefits of trampolining</query> If you are bouncing on a smaller rebounder rather than a larger scale trampoline you will see greater benefits with regards to bone strength since the number of impacts per minute will be higher. Enhanced Coordination and Motor Skills Finally, the last benefit that you’ll see from participating in a regular trampolining routine is improved coordination and motor skills. Being able to effectively control the body as it moves through space especially at the accelerated rate that it will be after coming off the rebounder takes a lot of coordination. Then you must also prepare the body for landing and ensure that you maintain proper form to rebound up again. This improvement in balance and coordination can transfer over to any other recreational activities or sports you might perform improving your overall performance there. So if you’re looking for a change of pace with your usual workouts, why not consider trampolining?<query> benefits of trampolining</query> You can purchase small rebounders at a very cost effective price and you may even want to check your gym or a local gymnastics facility for adult rebounding glasses. It’s a great way to get out, try a new activity, and get more fit in the process. Kristen Suzanne’s note: It’s recommended that you check with a physician before embarking on any new physical fitness routine.

The endorphins tackle two issues for you:1) providing energy so you don’t miss the caffeine and2) fighting headaches that may result from caffeine withdrawal.

Back in the day, one thing that helped me when I went to Starbucks was that I had them give me a small regular coffee, but had them put a quarter of it as hot water, and I increased that to half of the cup as hot water with the other half as coffee… and so on). And, of course, you can go half regular coffee with half decaf and eventually work your way to 100% decaf. Get organic when possible. Tea can rock the house. Both black tea and green tea are reputed to have a number of beneficial health properties, along with a more subtle caffeine boost than coffee.<query> what is the best coffee to drink</query> So, it’s a great way to enjoy a hot beverage with a little caffeine as you transition away from toxic, (often)-pesticide-ridden-caffeine-filled coffee. And, finally, you can have herbal tea as a goal beverage when you’re ready to eliminate all the caffeine in your diet (My favorite sources are: Traditional Medicinals, found at health food stores andMountain Rose Herbs - found online). Enjoy it sweetened with a touch of raw agave nectar (or a little organic maple syrup – not raw) or toss in a tablespoon of goji berries. Those make for an awesome treat at the end of the cup when they’re nice, plump and warm. If cola, Mt. Dew, Red Bull, etc., is your brand of poison, you’ll get a triple-whammy benefit by weaning yourself off of these antithesis-of-health beverages.<query> what to drink with caffeine</query> You’ll be eliminating not only caffeine, but also1) a fairly disgusting quantity of sugar (or artificial sweeteners, which bring their own host of problems); and2) the carbonic and phosphoric acids that are bad for your blood, leach calcium from your bones, and dissolve the enamel in your teeth. As with coffee, it may be easier to reduce your quantity gradually, such as by ordering a medium instead of a large (etc.), or pouring out the contents of a can when you’re 2/3 of the way through it. Another great idea is to gradually cut your fountain drinks with soda water, when available at self-serve fountains (it’s usually dispensed by a little hard-to-see plastic tab that may or may not be labeled). This won’t help reduce the acidity, but it will help you taper off your caffeine levels without denying yourself the refreshing and cleansing fizz—what I like to call“Throat Draino.” Caffeine is much more addictive than bubbles, so once you’ve<query> how to reduce caffeine</query> kicked your chemical addiction to caffeine, it will be much easier to phase out carbonated beverages entirely. Drink cold-pressed coffee, made with a Toddy Maker. This isn’t Raw and it still has caffeine, but it’s less acidic than regularly brewed coffee, so it’s a start (I’m all about the baby steps!). In the scheme of things, this is better than regular coffee. Use this as a stepping stone on your way to eliminating coffee from your life. You can find these machinesonline or at some Border’s bookstores. Drink Teeccino®, which is herbal coffee. YUM! My husband and I have become huge fans of this during the past year. For my husband, it was love at first sip. For me, although I really enjoyed it and would drink it here and there years ago when I first stumbled upon it, it wasn’t (at the time) the perfect coffee replacement to me.<query> what is the best coffee to drink</query> Then again, I was such a hard core coffee lover, I didn’t think anything would ever compare to the real thing. That being said, here I am, loving Teeccino – big time! I can’t imagine not having it. In fact, I don’t know what I was thinking years ago by not thinking this was an awesome coffee replacement. Not only does it taste great, but it’s not acidic and safe for pregnancy and breastfeeding. It’s high in potassium, helps restore alkalinity, and the chicory root can help improve digestion. We usually get the Maya Caffe (organic) because it’s the most coffee-like in flavor, but I do enjoy their flavored varieties, too. We love it plain (black), and we also enjoy it with Raw nut milk or other non-dairy milk for a nice creamy experience.<query> is teeccino acidic</query> It’s brewed similarly to coffee, using a coffee pot, but recently they launched a new product: Teeccino – “tee” bag style. Now, I can take it with me to restaurants and enjoy it (or Starbucks and just get a cup of hot water there to steep my tee bag). Teeccino is much better for your health than regular (or decaf) coffee, and can help transition you away from coffee. I’ve even brewed coffee mixed with Teeccino for some of my coffee addict friends to reduce the caffeine and help them transition. They love it. Make a beverage (or food) with raw chocolate powder. Raw chocolate has only small amounts of caffeine, but it has a stimulating effect from Theobromine. Many people love raw chocolate for the feel good, natural buzz they get when consuming it. There are many ways to enjoy this:1) blend warm water with Raw chocolate and a sweetener such as raw agave nectar (or use a raw nut milk and blend until warm for a hot chocolate type drink).2) You can also make chocolate nut milk by adding raw chocolate powder and a couple of pitted dates to it to the next batch of raw vegan nut milk you prepare.3) Make other Raw food recipes.<query> what is the best thing to drink raw</query>"

clueweb12-1503wb-33-01954,9,1,"What Is Desktop Linux Missing? Posted by Jon on June 12, 2006 The comments on my previous post about desktop Linux have gotten me thinking about what exactly desktop Linux needs in order to succeed. From where I sit, the big factors are: No Linux Distribution is built and marketed around the desktop . Sure, some distributions, such as SUSE Linux 10.1 OSS pretend to be, but in reality, they are still built around a set of philosophic principles that most end-users do not care about. If you want desktop converts, you are going to have to shut up about “restrictive software license” as an explanation why MP3s, Flash, PDFs, RealPlayer and Windows Media files do not work. The DVD Playback issue is not settled. Honestly, how do expect your average Joe to use your product when watching a movie on his laptop could make him a felon?<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I don’t know how this will shake out; either the ‘Betamax Defense’ will work, or some new tactic will have to be thought up, but I really believe that this one is a show-stopper. Drivers, Drivers, Drivers. If you are going to tout your product as a desktop replacement for Windows, then you are going to have to have as many driver options as Windows. No one wants to muck around with drivers just to get their network card working so that they can go read about what other hacks they need to get the rest of their hardware running. Excuses about not having access to specs from hardware vendors just don’t cut it here. If it doesn’t have drivers, and tons of them, and it can’t automatically detect and install more than 95% of the hardware out there, it isn’t a desktop operating system.<query> what is the difference between windows and betamax</query> Take a hint from Apple. No one is selling desktop Linux correctly. I don’t know what these folks have been smoking, but last time I looked, the large majority of people didn’t give a crap about freedom, cost-savings, or security update frequency when it came to theirOS. All people care about is whether or not their computer comes with everything they need to turn it on and start playing on the web and emailing their friends. Everything else is lagniappe. If you can’t sell it as an easier way to get stuff done, or you can’t get Dell to sell it preinstalled on their machines, you won’t sell it. There are probably other issues that I haven’t addressed, but from here, those are the biggies. Linux has a serious image problem – half of the desktopOS users don’t know what it is at all, and the other half think of it as too technical or “for experts and hackers”, regardless of whether or not they have ever used it.<query> why don't dell computers sell linux</query> Linux pundits have long talked about the technical merits of Linux, so much so that most people think of Linux as not being something they are capable of using, and as with most lifestyle and work-related options,better the devil you know than the devil you don’t. Posted under Pondering and tagged withDesktop Linux Comments (5) 5 Responses to What Is Desktop Linux Missing? June 15 2006 Shawn You have some good points, but I’m not sure I agree with all of them. The drivers, andDVD issues are no brainers. But the Take a Hint From Apple section got me thinking… Sure, it’d be nice to install anOS and never have to tweak it to work. But that just is not reality for most of theDIY computers – regardless of platform. I have to jump through hoops with Win2K/XP to get my Gigabit NIC working, I have to download comercial drivers for my Nvidia card.<query> what is desktop linux missing</query> I have to update my sound drivers. All this will happen wether I’m running Windows or Linux (I have no experience with Macs, so can’t comment). The only way around the problem is if the hardware manufacture installs the OS for you – preinstalled operating systems, like you see on store bought laptops and desktops. Or like Apple, who controls both the hardware AND software. So, as long as you have those who want to do it themselves (the DIY boxes), you will ALWAYS have installation issues. Simply because of the odd hardware combinations, and/or cutting edge hardware where the manufacturer only creates drivers for one version of anOS. My Thoughts. June 23 2006 Jon Shawn, I agree that any DIY computing project is going to have hardware/software conflicts,but I don’t agree that, by extension, Linux on the desktop can be excused from having those problems.<query> why do i always have to update my sound driver</query> Linux on the desktop is not about DIY projects. It is about the 80-90% of computers that come from the store with anOS loaded that is never changed. Desktop Linux is about Joe and Jane Average using Linux on a day-to-day basis. The fact that I have an laptop with SUSE running KDE on it has nothing to do with Linux on the desktop, because no one can go to Circuit City and buy that product.

There have been 0 comments Print By Donna Gates, as seen on: Insufficient sleep plagues 50 million to 70 million Americans today, especially women. Yet, sleeping deeply is fundamental for staying young, healthy, and vibrant. As the years pass, sleep often becomes more elusive. If you are not falling asleep, staying asleep, and waking up on time feeling refreshed, you’ll want to change this as soon as possible. Your brain is very much affected by the quality of your sleep. Research clearly confirms mood, cognition, and memory are negatively affected by sleep deprivation. So the solution is for an adult to sleep within an optimal range of seven to nine hours every night.<query> how many hours of sleep should i get</query> Napping works for many, and you may feel the need to take rejuvenating catnaps during the day. What’s most important is that your sleep be restful and restorative, with three to five complete sleep cycles that take you from drowsiness, into light sleep, followed by deep and then deeper sleep, and ending in REM. Most of us look for shortcuts when it comes to sleep. As with weekend-warrior exercise, we think we can “make up” weekday deficits by sleeping in on the weekend. But that’s not how it works. Many people also have caffeine, sugar, and alcohol in the late afternoon/early evening, further complicating their sleep issues. Another mistake we often make is using the computer or watching tv late at night. Light interferes with the production of melatonin, an important hormone related to sleep, so working late into the night, especially on the computer, or watching late-night tv might be cutting off years from your life.<query> what is the best way to sleep</query> If you’re having sleep trouble, it is crucial to reset your circadian rhythm or internal clock. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time Get up early and start to move. Exercise in the morning light will help you sleep better that night. In the spring, summer, and fall, sunbathe midday for 20 to 30 minutes. Since growth hormone is produced during the initial onset of nightly sleep. Go to bed early and you’ll not only become “healthy, wealthy, and wise,” you’ll also look and feel younger. Smaller pulses of growth hormone are also released later in your sleep cycle, so if you only sleep for five hours, you won’t obtain enough of this rejuvenating hormone. Make sure your last meal of the day contains a calming grain-like seed. Examples are quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and amaranth.<query> how to get your growth hormone back</query> They help create serotonin, which then turns into melatonin. As bedtime approaches, begin to celebrate the ritual of sleep. Take a hot bath and create a “sleep sanctuary,” with soft organic bedding, candles, soothing incense or aromatherapy, and relaxing music. Ensure that your sleep is restorative. A really great night’s rest is an investment in your anti-aging bank account!

So i generally fell like crap for the rest of the day. I have tried going to bed earlier, later but still only get 6 hrs maximum. What treatment do you suggest? Regards Donald Matthew's reply: Hi Donald, it is hard to know via email exactly what is causing your sleep problem. There are a few things that you should make sure of each evening though, some of which are obvious and you may already be doing. Caffeine, overeating, heavy or hard to digest meals, working right up till bedtime, watching tv or using a computer in the bedroom, heated discussions or arguing before bed can all affect sleep.<query> how long does it take to fall asleep</query> I suggest in addition to the above you go see a TCM practitioner (acupuncture/Chinese herbs) who will do a TCM diagnosis to find the specific internal imbalances related to the problem. Sleeping problems generally respond well to acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. There are many such practitioners in Brisbane. If you don't already know of one I suggest you look in the yellow pages under Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association (AACMA), which is the main governing body for such practitioners in Australia.

To determine if that six-week sweet spot would hold true for international routes, I asked the company to analyze fares for several trips, like a summer vacation to Europe and a winter escape in the Caribbean. Not only did the six-week period fail to stand up, but the findings indicate that the window for booking the cheapest ticket for these trips has increased over the past three years; in some cases it’s up to 24 weeks. “Consumers have been getting the best prices a bit further out year over year,” said Chuck Thackston, managing director of data and analytics at the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> how far in advance do you buy a flight</query> (1) the top social networks (1) thedrum (1) top mobile phone manufacturer (1) top social networks (1) Tracking (3) traffic data (1) TV (2) tv and apps (1) tw (1) twelpforce (1) Twitter (32) Twitter and TV (1) twitter business (1) twitter for business (1) Twitter Guides (9) twitter latest (1) twitter management (1) twitter marketing (1) Twitter Security Issues (2) twitter stats (1) user (1) user interface (1) Videos (1) viral (1) Virgin (1) web design (1) webdesign (1) website design (2) website guide (1) website landing pages (1) websites (1) Widgets (1) XBOX (2) Xbox Live (1) zynga (1) Text Widget Pages Home Contact Us Labels #RiotCleanUp (1) 2011 Social Business (9) 2011 social media (2) 2012 community management (1) 2012 olympics (1) 2012 reports (1) 2012 social media (2) 2012 tools (1) 4s (1) 900 million (1) Ad Networks (1) adobe (3) Adobe Flash (1) Advertising (5) Adverts (3) Agencies (3) airtime (1) Analytics (6) android (1) Apple (5) apple.<query> what is twitter</query> Sure, it’s possible that if travelers pull back on spending, airlines will be forced to cut prices, allowing travelers to nab a cheap summer flight to, say, Barcelona, as little as three weeks out. “If they don’t see bookings materialize the way they’d like, they will put the route on sale,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst. But Mr. Harteveldt and other travel watchers agree that booking well in advance is a safe bet. So far this year, airlines have raised rates three times, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of Farecompare.com, which tracks ticket prices. “I think pricing is going to be crazy,” particularly this summer, he said. So if you place stock in historical trends, the message is clear: act now. For guidance, here are the booking windows during which passengers paid the lowest price for flights to popular vacation destinations last year, based on data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation.<query> when do airlines raise prices</query> Europe in Summer LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 21 TO 22 WEEKS IN ADVANCE You may already be too late to score a cheap flight to Europe this summer. The booking window for the cheapest tickets has moved further out, from 11 or 12 weeks in advance in 2009 to 21 or 22 weeks in 2011. (Average round-trip fares rose to about $1,500 last year from $1,100 in 2009; this year’s outlook is no better.) To boost your savings, take the least expensive route to Europe you can find. Then concentrate on getting to your ultimate stop cheaply. “I look into the cheapest fare into a hub like Berlin,” said George Hobica, founder ofAirfarewatchdog.com, which scours the Web for bargains. “Then I figure it out from there.” He said this may involve taking the train or flying a budget carrier like easyJet or Ryanair to the final destination.<query> how far in advance to book a flight to europe</query> Spanish airports like Madrid tend to be cheaper than London or Paris, he said. Dublin and Shannon also tend to be cheaper jumping-off points. Whatever you do, don’t wait until the last minute. Last year, average fares for tickets purchased less than a week before travel were about $2,600, almost double the price of those bought at least 28 days in advance. And if you’re visiting London during the Olympic Games, July 27 through Aug. 12, expect to pay a premium. Caribbean in Winter LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 11 OR 12 WEEKS In 2009 and 2010, the cheapest airfares went to procrastinators who purchased tickets just two weeks in advance at a saving of about 8 percent. But last year, the pattern took a sudden shift, with the cheapest tickets bought much further ahead. “Certainly you’ll want to start shopping plenty early to get a gauge on pricing,” said Mr. Seaney of FareCompare, who recommended hunting for airfare as early as three months in advance, especially for hot spots like Costa Rica and out-of-the-way islands, which lack the airline competition that tends to keep prices in check.<query> how far in advance should you book flights</query> Business or First Class to Asia or Europe LAST YEAR’S SWEET SPOT: 23 TO 24 WEEKS While the majority of premium travel is purchased by business travelers booking within six weeks of departure, leisure travelers with the flexibility to buy well in advance have been able to find bargains. Travelers paid about $3,113, or about 20 percent less than average, when buying premium tickets to Asia or Europe 23 or 24 weeks ahead last year. A good time to take advantage of low business-class rates is during peak vacation times like summer or the winter holidays. While coach class quickly fills up with leisure travelers, the cushy seats at the front of the plane can be empty. Rather than give those seats away as upgrades, airlines often try to fill them with sales, according to Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the travel Web site JoeSentMe.com, which alerts members to such sales.<query> when is the best time to buy airline tickets</query> For travel to Europe in summer, for example, “it looks like all gateways and all destinations between the United States and Europe are on sale,” he stated in a recent newsletter, with round-trip business class prices as low as $2,327 from Newark to Brusselsand $2,359 from New York to Frankfurt, if booked by May 31. But, he warned, “Fares seem to be higher in August than in July, and there are some days when prices soar above $4,000 round trip from the East Coast.” General Tips Beyond historical trends, there are also some useful online tools that can help you evaluate fares. For example, Bing.com offers a Price Predictor that uses algorithms to determine how likely a fare is to rise or fall during the next seven days. It applies to flights from more than 250 cities in the United States and to top domestic destinations and major hubs in Europe.<query> what is the average cost of a flight from the us to europe</query> If you decide to wait in the hopes of a price drop, sign up for fare alerts offered by practically every travel site, from American Airlines to Travelzoo. Yapta.com, another price-tracking service, alerts travelers when the price of their plane tickets drop after purchase, allowing travelers to request an airline voucher for the price difference. For the cheapest dates to fly, go to Itasoftware.com , which allows you to scan an entire month’s worth of fares. To buy, you must go to the airline’s Web site or online agencies like Travelocity. Finally, buying two one-way fares on separate airlines can be cheaper than the best round-trip price. Kayak.com calls such tickets “hacker fares.” A recent search on the site for a flight from Boston to San Juan, P.R., turned up a fare of $313 on Delta to San Juan, returning on US Airways, compared with $349 round trip on US Airways alone.<query> how to find the cheapest airline tickets</query> http://SocialBusinessToday.net - The Best in Social Business Email This BlogThis!

I have worked with stallions who were allowed to interact normally with other horses, turned out in green pastures to play, and given demanding work schedules at high levels of training. These horses were intelligent, sane and an absolute pleasure to work with. I have also been in a barn where every one of the horses demonstrated neurotic behavior. These poor animals were so carefully protected in the name of performance in the show ring that their lives consisted of little more than being held hostage in a beautifully maintained cell. A review of child development books and theories reveals that an important key to well adjusted, productive and healthy children is a wide ranging exposure to a variety of people and relationships, environments, activities and ideas.<query> what is neurotic behavior in horses</query> It is hard to imagine any rational person advocating that children be isolated and sensory deprived so that they could achieve better grades or respond more perfectly to their parent's desires. And it takes very little imagination to grasp what the effects of such isolation might be on the average child. Consider the concept that dogs should have limited, if any, play or social interactions with other dogs. The rationale here is that a dog dealing with another dog must either be dominant or submissive. In having to learn the rules of normal dog behavior, these trainers believe that these dogs will have their fragile egos irreparably damaged by having to submit to other dogs, or become unduly dominant, thus rendering them incapable of successful competitive work. Does this really make sense? What happened to stable dogs who can actually deal with life?<query> why do dogs have to be dominant</query> I read one article where the author carefully explained how each new group of dogs required a sorting of social hierarchy, and that if the that group changed at all, the dogs would need to sort it out all over again. What a surprise! Every time you (also a social animal subject to power structures and dominance hierarchies) enter a room of other people, the same process repeats itself. It is through such repeated interactions and sorting that you come to some sense of who you are no matter what group you are in. The most confident dogs I know are dogs who extremely well socialized, and able to handle themselves in almost any setting. There is a grain of truth here - a very small grain at best. There is no question that an inappropriate playmate can scare the pants off a dog (especially a puppy), sometimes leaving a serious and lasting impression.<query> why are dogs so confident</query> There is no question that a dog who is an absolute bully with other dogs may make a lousy competitive dog - lacking respect or sense or both, no doubt he could be found wanting when it comes to respecting and cooperating with a human. But the larger truth here is that a normal dog who is properly and thoroughly socialized, allowed to develop appropriate manners, and who knows when to politely bow deep and when to hold his head high is a dog who is not easily shaken by odd encounters. What these trainers fear most of all is that their dog will come to prefer dogs as playmates rather than the handler. They will even tell you this in no uncertain language. My question is, if the dog would rather play with another dog than work with you, doesn't that tell you something? If your spouse preferred to spend his/her weekends with another man/woman, wouldn't that be a clue?<query> what is a dog that is a playmate</query> Let's pretend that you adore checkers, and attend every checkers tournament that comes to town. One day, you decide that your child/spouse/friend (choose one) should also enjoy checkers as you do. As you sit enraptured by the fine points of multiple jumps, your guest sees a squirrel in the tree outside the window. ""Gosh,"" he/she says as they leap from their seat, ""I didn't realize there were squirrels around here!"" And off they go to stare up a tree, finding this much more fun than watching checkers with you. BIG hint there, eh? It is possible to have a relationship based on mutual respect, free from anything that remotely resembles sensory deprivation, and still have a dog who will work his heart out for you and even more importantly, with you.<query> can you have a dog with you</query> Since I do not choose to compete in the obedience ring, there are some readers who, mistakenly equating titles achieved with knowledge earned, will question my basis for this statement. In my many years of involvement with dogs, it is the two plus years of working with my dog as a Search & Rescue team that has taught me the most about what is possible between a dog and a human in a working relationship. On our first official search, what few joys the formal obedience ring held for me evaporated in a moonlit cornfield somewhere in Pennsylvania as I watched my dog work and work and work, with me, off lead under bizarre circumstances. . . until the sun came up. I have watched my search partner, a young German Shepherd named Chilkat, play sticks and ""keep away"" with other dogs in the search unit as we prepare for a practice search.<query> what kind of dog is chilkat</query> A quiet whistle or call brings him to me instantly ready for work, which means a scent discrimination exercise that could last up to two hours in pouring rain, freezing cold or blistering heat. Walking through a park with 7 off lead dogs, I have sent a friend to hide, and without having to dispose of the other dogs, put Chilkat on a formal search command. He is at work in a flash, ignoring even the puppy's attempts to restart their game of a moment ago. In both cases, when his job is done, Chilkat happily returns to playing with the other dogs, groveling appropriately to his elders or giving a pesty puppy notice that her manners are somewhat lacking. On real searches, I have hiked over strange farm fields in the middle of the night, watching my dog ignore other dogs, farm animals, even rabbits and deer that flushed under his very feet.<query> what is chilkat's job</query> I have watched him work for four straight hours on a mountaintop after an hour's climb (past a black bear and cubs) to our start point. His only failing in that working situation was his refusal to rest more than three minutes, a fact my weary legs found nearly unforgivable! The notion of having to artificially insure that my dogs found me incredibly interesting disturbs me. If I ever found myself in any relationship with a healthy being (human, canine, equine, or any other species) where I had to cajole, bribe, pay or take hostage my intended pal in order to assure their interest in me, I'd have to take a very long hard look in the mirror. In the case of unhealthy or unbalanced beings, such as very sick or emotionally disturbed animals or people, I have indeed made unusual foods, exciting games and/or extra attention my opening bids in the friendship game.<query> why do dogs keep their interest in me</query> And I did so with full recognition that as they were at that moment, a normal relationship was not possible, and that I chose to interact with them in an unbalanced way. But I did not withhold normal food, access to independent play or playmates, or my attention. That is not a relationship, or a friendship. It may be an appropriate interaction between organism and source of stimuli, but I need more from dogs than simple, conditioned responses. I have dogs first and foremost as my friends, and I do my damnedest to treat them as such. I often fail to be as generous and unflagging a friend to my dogs as they are to me. But I'm learning. The dog is commonly referred to as ""man's best friend."" I wish that dogs could talk, if only to gain their perspective on what that really means for them.<query> what is the relationship between a dog and a human</query> Perhaps, like the hostages in Stockholm, some of our dogs would find themselves pleading for leniency for their captors.

Then this article is for you!! The ""pit bull"" dog movement has become so entrenched in the idea of ""protecting"" the dogs and operating out of fear/worst-case-scenarios that we sometimes end up denying ""pit bull"" dogs the the basic experiences and socialization that every dog needs and deserves. In a self-fulfilling prophecy, we become so consumed with fear that we end up creating the very same behaviors we wanted to prevent. This is not protection. Surely there are some dogs (of all breeds) who will never exist peacefully with other dogs, regardless of how much socialization and training is done, but those dogs are the minority.<query> why are pitbull dogs considered pets</query> It's time to stop letting fear dictate our ""protection"" of ""pit bull"" dogs. This article, although intended for any breed/mix of dog, offers some great food for thought. (Above caption taken from Animal Farm's facebook page https://www.facebook.com/animalfarmfoundation) Of Hostages & Relationships Do you need to isolate a dog or limit playtime with other dogs or people? by Suzanne Clothier He said that he loved her. He said that his relationship with her mattered almost more than anything else in his life. He said that he enjoyed working with her, and sharing new ideas. To be sure, she never took her eyes off his face, paying no heed to the audience who waited breathlessly to hear his secrets for such adoration, such undivided attention. ""First"", he said, ""I never let her talk to anyone but me.<query> what kind of dog is a pit bull</query> When I leave for work, I lock her in a room, which is pretty boring for her, but when I get home - oh, is she ever glad to see me! If she wants to do anything, except go to the bathroom, she has to do it with me. I control her food, her exercise and all her activities. Wherever we go, I insist that she always look at me, so I know for sure she's paying absolute attention. I don't let her have any friends, because they might distract her or use up the energy she needs for working. Being the only social contact she has, I am very important to her. Naturally, she'd rather be with me than anyone else."" The audience didn't gasp. They didn't protest in any way.<query> why do i lock my daughter in a room</query> They didn't stand up and tell him that was archaic, outrageous treatment. They did not shout out that this was not, could not be, the secret of a healthy, happy relationship. Instead, they nodded, and took notes. They thought this made perfect sense. Was this some sensationalistic talk show featuring, ""Taking A Hostage - Key to a Happy Relationship?"" Unfortunately, it was not Geraldo or Sally. This was a dog training seminar, and ""he"" was talking about ""her"" - his dog. (And while I say ""he"", this attitude is certainly not limited to male trainers but applies equally to female trainers.) If this had been a man talking about his wife, or a mother discussing how she raised her kids, the audience would have been, rightfully, appalled.<query> who is taking hostage</query> But it was, after all, only a dog, and these were techniques helpful to top competitive performance. If we examine the theories behind the methodology, we come up with some pretty scary notions. While long appalled by the notion of needing to isolate a dog to improve his willingness to work with you, I began to wonder why this concept not only was ""successful"" (if, in defining success you are willing to discard a healthy, normal relationship and focus only on competitive performance) but sounded vaguely familiar. The answer? ""The Stockholm Syndrome,"" a psychological phenomenon named after the people in a Stockholm bank who were held hostage. In this syndrome, those forcibly taken hostage, surprisingly, develop positive feelings for their captors. To understand the Stockholm Syndrome, you must understand the effects of sensory deprivation.<query> what is stockholm syndrome</query> Imagine, if you can, being forcibly removed from your daily life (with all its familiar environments, routines and social interactions) and put in a strange place from which you cannot escape. Your only interactions are with your captors, whose behavior can be capricious - that is, beyond your ability to understand why or when they may choose to do something for you, with you or to you. They may withhold food and/or water, in order to raise its value to you in order to receive your compliance with their demands. You may be left in complete silence or darkness with nothing to do, nowhere to go. You may not be allowed to talk or interact with other prisoners. It would appear that a reasonable (human) response to this would be anger. To be sure, this is often the initial response of any hostage.<query> what is the capricious behavior of a hostage</query> Yet, as the hostages in the Stockholm bank demonstrated, the desire for survival quickly supercedes hostility. Your entire world now revolves around your captor(s), and within the sensory vacuum in which you now exist, their moods and actions become all consuming. Anticipating their desires, appeasing them - these are the possible keys to survival. Further, deprived of normal social interaction, you begin to see your captors more sympathetically. In the original Swedish case, investigators were astonished to hear the freed hostages asking for leniency for their captors. For any social creature (man, whales, gorillas, wolves, horses, dogs, chimpanzees, dolphins), the quickest way to create neurosis and abnormal behaviors is social isolation and a sterile sensory environment. Within the zoological community, the greatest success rates in terms of animal mortality, health and normal breeding and rearing of offspring occurs with animals who are allowed normal social groups and interactions, and whose environments are as varied and rich as a zoo can manage to provide.<query> what is the quickest way to create neurosis in animals</query>"

Holding in heat is very important in maintaining an appropriate temperature for cooking. Heat loss, smoke loss and moisture loss are critical factors in grilling and smoking. A constant temperature is the best way to insure that your foods will be cooked thoroughly in the length of time called for in the recipe. Lower quality grills often loose heat during cooking, increasing cooking time and drying the food out during the process. The ceramic charcoal grill is more expensive than many styles, but is well worth it. They are easier to clean than many other models. If the grates are sprayed with vegetable oil or non stick spray, they will usually wipe clean without scrubbing or abrasive brushes.<query> what is the best grill to use for cooking</query> They are also very durable. If cared for, they can easily outlast many of their competitors on the market. A ceramic charcoal grill is usually a vertical style grill. Though they look different than what many people are used to seeing, the style is easy to learn to use. Doors and access panels make it simple to access the food and charcoal. Different models have different types of door, so be sure to shop around for what works best for you. If you cannot find the right grill at your local stores, there is an extensive selection online of quality ceramic grills. Be sure to get a good warranty for your grill, because it can be a considerable investment for many incomes.

Setting the grill temperature within the proper range and keeping it there is the first step in excellent grilled food. Learn to use your vents to raise and lower the temperature. Opening vents further allows more air to get to the coals, heating the fire up. Pushing vents further toward the closed position reduces air, decreasing the fire heat. Remember, your vents only open and close a few inches. Small adjustments can make big differences in the internal temperature. You need to learn where and how to stack the coals for the type of cooking you will be doing. For indirect grilling, you do not want the coals directly under the food.<query> how to adjust the temperature on a charcoal grill</query> Place coals in a pile or a couple of groupings in the grill, not directly under the food. This allows the meat to cook slowly and not sear on the outside before it is done on the inside. Placing a pan of water in the grill will add moisture. Wood chips and herbs can also add flavor while grilling. Soak the wood chips for about 30 minutes before adding to the coals. This will allow the wood to smoke without flaming up and burning away. For longer cooking times, use wood chunks instead. These need to be soaked for about two hours before being placed on the grill. Trial and error is, unfortunately, part of the learning process of grilling with charcoal. Begin with less expensive cuts of meat. Once you learn to control the temperature and grill environment, start working your way up to more expensive meats and foods.<query> how long to soak wood chips before grilling</query> Choosing the correct cut of meat and the best cooking process for that cut is crucial in the outcome of the meal. When grilling beef, higher fat content is actually better. Much of the fat will melt and drip off the meat, adding moisture and flavor as it cooks. What you do not want in a cut of meat is a huge ring of fat. You want to look for cuts that have marbling. Marbling is very thin strips of fat working a pattern throughout the meat. This is the secret for tender, juicy steaks. Pork is well served by brining before grilling. Soak the pork for several hours or overnight in a solution of salt water. Brining will tenderize the pork and help it to stay moist. Most cuts of pork are more suited to low and slow cooking than hot, fast grilling like steak.<query> what is the best cut of meat to grill</query>"

""hdc1""--third IDE hard drive, first partition, etc. SCSI drives have analogous names but start with the letters ""sd"" (=""SCSI drive""), followed by the letter indicating the SCSI interface and by the number indicating the SCSI device id. For example, ""sda4"" means ""first SCSI interface, id number 4"".<query> what is the hda1</query> If you have an external zip drive attached to your parallel port, it will appear as SCSI device ""sda4"" (zip drives work in a SCSI-emulation mode). The listing of partitions that your Linux setup program presents to you during installation will include any MS Windows partitions which you have. For example, I have the following MS Windows partition: mount point type size comment [no mount] vfat 1200 MB [""Win C drive, hda1] /mnt/dos_hdd2 vfat 1600 MB [""Win D drive, hdd2] Don't erase these MS Windows partitions during your Linux installation if you want a dual boot. If you erase the MS Windows partition, MS Windows is gone from your system! If not sure, backup your data from your MS Windows partitions before Linux installation. ""msdos"", ""fat"" and ""vfat"" and ""ntfs"" are typical filesystems used by DOS and MS Windows 3.x/95/98/NT.<query> what is linux partition</query> As a quick reference, here is a brief summary of the standard linux partition types (""filesystems"") with a short description. I copied the info from the linux manual pages:man fs and man mount (with some additions after I had a look at the source code files at /usr/src/linux/fs). The underlined filesystems are the ones that you are more likely to use. Other filesystems (not listed below) are available as add-ons (for example journaling filesystems, compressed, encrypted, ...). minix is the filesystem used in the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux. It has a number of shortcomings: a 64MB partition size limit, short filenames, a single time stamp, etc. It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks. ext is an elaborate extension of the minix filesystem.<query> what is the filesystem for linux</query> It has been completely superseded by the second version of the extended filesystem (ext2) and will eventually be removed from the kernel. ext2 is the high performance disk filesystem used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media. The second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the extended file system (ext). ext2 offers the best performance (in terms of speed and CPU usage) of the filesystems supported under Linux. In short, ext2 is the main (default, typical) Linux filesystem. ext3 is an extension of the ext2 filesystem with journaling. It is backwards and forward compatibile with ext2. It means that ext2 can be converted into ext3 without reformatting or data loss (just re-mounting the partion is required). ext3 can be changed back to ext2, also without data loss. I use ext3 extensively since Oct.2001--it is simple and trouble-free.<query> what is ext3</query> It is included as an installation ""option"" since RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.0. It is highly recommended that you use this filesystem. xiafs was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by extending the Minix filesystem code. It provides the basic most requested features without undue complexity. The xia filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained. It is used infrequently. msdos is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers. msdos filenames can be no longer than 8 characters followed by an optional period and 3 character extension. umsdos is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux. It adds capability for long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem, without sacrificing compatibility with DOS. vfat is an extended DOS filesystem used by Microsoft Windows95 and Windows NT.<query> what is msdos</query> VFAT adds capability for long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem. proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading and interpreting /dev/kmem. In particular, its files do not take up disk space. Seeman 5 proc. iso9660 is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO 9660 standard. Two extensions (listed below) are automatically supported. High Sierra --Linux supports High Sierra, the precursor to the ISO 9660 standard for CD-ROM filesystems. It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. Rock Ridge --Linux also supports the System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol. They are used to further describe the files in the iso9660 filesystem to a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, and devices.<query> what is iso9660</query> It is automatically recognized within the iso9660 filesystem support under Linux. hpfs is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2. This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to the lack of available documentation. sysv is an implementation of the SystemV/Coherent filesystem for Linux. It implements all of Xenix FS, SystemV/386 FS, and Coherent FS. nfs is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers. smb is a network filesystem that supports the SMB protocol, used by MS Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT, and Lan Manager. To use smb fs, you need a special mount program, which can be found in the ksmbfs package, found at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/smbfs. [Standard linux command ""smbmount"" will also do.] ncpfs is a network filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.<query> what is linux smb</query> devpts--is a pseudo file system, traditionally mounted on /dev/pts. In order to acquire a pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/ . fat --is not a separate filesystem, but a common part of the msdos, umsdos and vfat filesystems. UFS --is a file system widely used in different operating systems. swap--is a special partition type used for swapping data from memory to hard drive. raiserfs--is a brand new journaling filesystem available as standard with Linux kernel version 2.4.1 up (January 2001). hfs (=hierarchical files system)--MacIntosh filesystem.

Linux Applications • 7. Learn Linux Commands • A. How to Upgrade Kernel? Before Linux installation, you might really want to know what a hard drive partition is. The concern is that you delete your MS Windows partition when you really don't want to--you want two separate partitions to dual boot. This means: MS Windows is on one partition, Linux is on a separate partition. You do not normally install Linux on free space on your MS Windows-allocated partition(s). It is possible to install Linux on a MS Windows partition, but we do not recommend it. If you plan a dual boot (Linux and MS Windows on the same computer), first use your DOS/Win utilityFDISK to make the MS Windows partition(s).<query> what is the partition for linux</query> Leave part of the hard drive(s) unpartitioned for Linux. You will make and format the Linux partitions during your RedHat (or Mandrake or whatever else) installation. Linux will recognize the free space on the harddrive. Make the MS Windows partition ""primary"" and ""bootable"". Install, configure, and test your MS Windows before Linux installation. If you plan to run Linux only, you need just a clean hard drive (no partitions) to start with. It is possible to have only one Linux partition (plus one for MS Windows if you dual-boot). But it is better to have more partitions so that you can keep users' data separate from the rest of the operating system. This way, if something ever goes wrong, or if you have to reformat or re-install the operating system, you don't lose the users' data.<query> how to install linux on a hard drive</query> (You can perform a complete Linux re-install without losing the contents of the /home directory that contains all user data if you skip the ""re-format"" option given to you during installation. But for that, the /home directory must be on its own partition.) During the Linux setup, you will be asked to partition the available space on your hard drive(s). There are many possible ways to partition, depending on your hard drive space, requirements, and taste. I like Linux hard drive partitions like this (for a modest total of 2 GB of hardrive space which I give to Linux in this example): mount point type size / ext2 300 MB /usr ext2 1200 MB /home ext2 380 MB swap swap 120 MB In the above example, I dedicate 300 MB for the root partition that holds the base of the Linux operating system.<query> how much space does linux need</query> I allocate 1200 MB to the mount point that will be visible on my filesystem as the/usr directory and will contain the user's programs (the programs that don't come with the base operating system and I install later, for example StarOffice). I dedicate 380 MB for the partition that will be visible as the directory/home and will contain the setting and data of all users on the machine. And I allocate 120 MB to a ""raw"" partition for the operating system to use as the virtual memory (extension of the physical, silicon memory on the hard drive, so-called swap). If your kernel is lower than 2.2 (this is the case with standard RH5.2 and earlier), your swap partition cannot be larger than approximately 127 MB. The rule of thumb is that the swap should be about twice the amount of the physical memory (RAM).<query> what is the size of a swap partition</query> If you need more (e.g. if you have lots of physical memory, or you expect to run custom programs with really large data structures) you might want to create a larger swap partition during the installation (or several smaller swap partitions) or add a swap file(s) later. 2 GB is a respectible amount of disk space and should be sufficient for users who like having many applications. (This is because Linux applications tend to be slimmer than their MS Windows equivalents). However, if you try to install everything that's available on the modern distribution CDs, you will surely run out of disk space. My experience is that however large the hard drive space, it will get filled and I regret I don't have more :-) . If my space on the hard drive is really restricted, I may consider a two-partition setup like this (for a lean 650 MB total dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 600 MB swap swap 50 MB<query> how much space do i need for linux</query> In this example, I dedicate 600 MB to the base of the operating system, applications, and user documents/data, and allow 50 MB for the swap partition (for the operating system to use as the virtual memory). The 50-MB swap should be quite sufficient for medium duty operations. The limitation of 600 MB for the operating system, applications and user data means that you will have to be very selective as to which applications you install or else you risk running out of hard drive space. Try pressing when installing the optional software that comes on the Red Hat CD--it will give you a short description of what the software does so you could perhaps decide if you really need it. (Don't worry too much if you miss something you need, you can install the missing parts later).<query> how much space does a redhat cd need</query> You can easily finish the RedHat installation with 200 MB free on your Linux partition (out of 600 MB used in this example) if you make reasonable choices. Please note that ""bundling together"" the root partition ""/"" and the /home directory will likely save you some disk space, but it is not the safest solution. It is possible to install Linux on even less disk space than in the example above, but you will have to be really picky as to what you install. For a larger available hard drive space, I may consider the following setup (for a comfortable total of 15 GB dedicated to Linux): mount point type size / ext2 800 MB /usr ext2 5000 MB /usr/local ext2 3000 MB /home ext2 5200 MB swap swap 1000 MB Please note that the the mount points can reside on different physical hard drives.<query> how much space do i need to install linux</query> Linux agglomarates all the hard drive space into a single directory tree. Another consideration when setting up the partitions on older computers (486?). Many older BIOSes have the restriction that the boot partition cannot extend beyond the 1024th cylinder on your first physical hard drive. To overcome this limitation, simply make the first (bootable) partition so that it ends before the cylinder number 1023 (this makes this partition max approximately 512 MB in size, which is plenty for the ""/"" root partition). Once Linux boots, the BIOS restriction does not matter any more because Linux takes over the hardware management and it can access the partition(s) beyond the cylinder number 1023. When installing and using Linux, your drives appear as devices with the following names: hda--first IDE drive (stands for ""hard drive a"", i.e. the master drive on the first IDE interface), hdb--second IDE drive (i.e., the slave drive on the first IDE interface), hdc--third IDE drive (i.e. the master drive on the second IDE interface), hdd--fourth IDE drive (i.e. the slave drive on the second IDE interface).<query> what is the partition number for linux</query>"

Another example is games, I'm pretty sure that games like UT2k3 and NWN (which were ported to Linux) sell more because of this. Professional software developers that don't port usually falls into one of these categories: 1. Too lazy 2. They don't program with cross-platformability in mind (i.e. DirectX) 3. Their publisher is a jackass 4. It would cost more money to port it than they would gain from porting it 5. They don't recognize the Linux community I'm not using any of those as an insult.

In the blue, Microsoft corner, the long-awaited Internet Explorer 9 finally made its official appearance. After several months of open testing of beta versions, we got the finished product, promising high performance and a simple interface, ready to ease your work and entertainment on the web. Interface If Internet Explorer 8 was looking after the then-current versions of Firefox in terms of user interface, IE9 is based on the minimalistic philosophy put forward by Google Chrome. All tool and menu bars are gone, replaced with a single bar that contains the address field, tabs and three icons to access all of IE9’s tools and settings. Of course, if you need all the bars, or are just feeling retro, it’s simple enough right-clicking the window surface and restoring a desired bar in its usual place.<query> what is the interface of ie9</query> This graphics interface solution shows that Microsoft has also embraced the viewpoint that the Internet browser is just that - a tool to display web content, and that the browser’s interface must never get in the way of the webpage’s actual content, or even seem dominant; furthermore, users don’t even need the hidden controls most of the time. Besides the visual ones, IE9 also offers many other improvements and tools for quicker and easier web browsing. “Download Manager” is one such tool, and one noticeably lacking in previous versions of Internet Explorer. This download browser is most akin to the Firefox solution - a simple window to enable you to see the list of current and previous downloads, the original location of the file and where it’s been saved on the hard drive etc., as well as to run, stop and delete downloads.<query> what is download manager</query> Another novelty is the “New Tab” page - a generic page that will welcome you each time when you open a new tab, and just like a similar page in Chrome, offer the list of most commonly visited websites, as well as the ability to reopen recently closed tabs and windows. One more new feature is the possibility of turning on website tracking, in order for the browser to be able to make recommendations to the user as to other popular websites that may be of interest. This option uses your website history to generate a list of propositions that may be of interest to you, but that you’ve been unaware of (haven’t visited) thus far. “One Box” is a unified dropdown box which displays search recommendations based on your previous searches, but also the particular search engine’s recommendations. Finally, there’s the logical evolution of many browsers’ search homepage, entitled “Pinned Sites” here - you’re<query> what is website tracking in chrome</query> now able to drag & drop a particular website onto Windows 7’s taskbar, creating an icon that will enable you to run IE9 and open the desired webpage quickly and easily. Furthermore, using this feature and the integration with Windows 7, websites are now allowed to customise these links with specific commands and shortcuts applicable to the website. Security The belief that Microsoft’s browsers are insecure and that problems contained within them are found and amended on a daily basis is still widespread. Of course, all those who’ve been following and testing browser safety are familiar with the fact that this just isn’t true anymore and that IE8 redefined Internet Explorer safety standards to the point where other browsers took to some of them. IE9, just like its predecessor, separates different tabs into different processes, while pinned sites are run as entirely independent applications.<query> what is the difference between ie9 and ie9</query> This provides maximum browser stability and ensures that one tab crashing won’t affect the functionality of others. What’s more, the “sandbox” model that’s used by these processes ensures that the process can’t take over your PC even if hijacked by malicious software. Like its predecessor, IE9 is actively using the SmartScreen base for recognising malicious sites, but also adds an additional security layer, by scanning every downloaded file in search for malicious code. IE9 also has the ability to filter and shut down all ActiveX controls on various websites, activating only those that you really need. Besides the already familiar InPrivate Browsing option, habitually called “incognito mode”, after the term introduced by Google Chrome, IE9 also contains the Tracking Protection option, which provides even more detailed and secure settings concerning the information about you and your PC that will be made available to the websites you’re visiting and their partners.<query> what is ie9</query> Prev - Next >> Site Map - Navigation Home News Hardware Mobile Games Internet IT Software InsideHW Misc WebReviews Reviews CPU Motherboards Memory Graphics Cards Mobility Notebooks Multimedia Configurations Cases Cooling PSU Displays Digital Cameras Peripherals Optical Drives Storage Software Operating Systems Office Suite Tools Multimedia Internet Guides Overclocking Modding Editorials Interviews Events Columns Contact Us Contents copyright © 2007-2012 by Digital World.

clueweb12-1415wb-90-25281,26,1,"This is the third generation of MMI, and its operation has been simplified by the adoption of a joystick that's integrated into the central control knob. It has a new complete-word input capability, three-dimensional map displays and a music jukebox on the internal hard disc drive. Operating it may require a little familiarization but it is quicker and requires less button-clicking frustration than similar systems. The MMI controller is immediately behind the shifter but not accidentally hit by a resting hand or quick shift. To the left of the lever are the parking brake and Start/Stop buttons, and to the right is the volume knob; this is less than convenient in sixth gear so you'll find the steering wheel control the logical, handy choice. Below the central screen are a pair of vents and some simple switchgear.<query> where is the mmi controller</query> At the base of the console are the climate controls, with buttons to select fan speed, temperature, airflow, and seat heat and a small rotary knob to make the adjustments. Full auto mode is available, as is full manual control without any confusion. The navigation system works as directed. Sound from the optional 505-watt, 14-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo system is most impressive. Outward visibility is quite good, with relatively narrow pillars and the side posts far enough rearward that they don't interfere with lane-change or close-quarter over the shoulder glances. The rear pillars are generally unnoticed, the rear window usefully large and distortion-free, and the edges of the bodywork not totally lost in the distance. Cabin storage includes a shallow bin in the armrest, one center cupholder and a phone-sized bin adjacent, glovebox, and door pockets with beverage stands at the leading edge.<query> what is the cabin of a dodge ram</query> The trunk opening is larger than many two-doors and takes advantage of the trunk lid length to open well out of the way.

Whale Introduction » Interior / Walk Around » Driving Impressions » Summary Walk Around The Audi A5 and S5 are arguably among the best looking cars on the road, appearing at once formal and sporting. On each side a strong character line arches over the front wheel and carries all the way to the tail, but apart from the bottom of the door and sides of the panoramic glass roof there's hardly a straight line to be found. Proportions are classic coupe with minimal bodywork ahead of the front wheels, a substantial rear roof pillar, moderate trunk lid and a longer tail than snout. The door windows are frameless and visual strength is added by a central pillar that hides as a dark panel behind the rear side glass. Cabriolets keep much the same proportions with their folding soft-top (which folds in 15 seconds, among the fastest in class) and really look good with the top down.<query> what is the best looking car</query> Out in the open the A5 appears larger than it really is; the Audi is half a foot shorter than Jaguar's XK, BMW's 650 or Bentley's GTC and just half a foot longer than a 911, yet it comes across at least as spacious inside as any of those. In terms of styling, the A5 is the cleanest, the S5 the most aggressive, and the A5 with S line package splits the difference. The leading edges of the car are the inner points of the lower grilles that separate the central grille section from the lights and side grilles, much like the leading points of a manta ray. On the S5 aluminum-look trim is used at the lower edge of the grille, on the outside mirrors, and at the bottom of the rear bumper between the four exhaust outlets.<query> what is the difference between audi a5 and s5</query> Bi-xenon headlamps give these cars that wild-animal-stalking-prey look. Crisp, white LED daytime running lamps run along the bottoms and outer edges of these headlamps, setting a higher standard for appearance and function; they can be turned off if you wish, automatically dim for use as parking lights, and are off on whichever side the turn signal is blinking for better vision of said signal. Some car companies could learn something from this design. Most wheels are five-spoke or a derivative, like the two-by-five propeller-blade shaped spokes on the S5 which use a fingered center cap to cover all the lug nuts. The designer of the A5 calls the car the most beautiful he has ever designed. The A5 made it onto Hagerty's Hot List, so a leading insurer of collector cars believes the A5 may become more desirable over the next 20 years.<query> what is the most beautiful car</query> Interior 2011 Audi A5 Climb into an Audi A5 and you're immediately convinced this is a driver's car, albeit a nicely finished one that you could easily use as a daily driver. The A5 and S5 offer multiple selections of leather and trim, including different types of wood, carbon fiber, aluminum or stainless steel. Every surface has a pleasant feel, regardless of the material from which it's constructed. It is modern Teutonic luxury in the vein of multiple finishes that complement each other well, with stark efficiency or warmth determined by color choices and trim components. The S5 cabin is done in mostly dark materials, including the woven headliner and sunshade. Lighter trim highlights the roof panel pull (it slides forward from the rear), gauge nacelles, vents, speaker grilles, and control knobs with piano black centers.<query> what is the interior of audi a5</query> The black lacquer also surrounds the primary control area aft of the shifter. A three-spoke leather-wrapped wheel has hand grips at all the right places and just two controls on each side spoke. However, each side has a thumbwheel that serves multiple functions by scrolling up or down or pressing to click, allowing a majority of system operations to be done without removing a hand from the wheel. Oft-used controls like cruise, signals, flash-to-pass/main beams, and wipe/wash are all on handy stalks. The wheel adjusts for reach and rake with a single manual release, giving all the advantages: Proper driving position, spacing from airbag, and instrument view. The center armrest also adjusts for height and rake, so it you can use it in cruise mode and slide it out of the way for lots of shifting on winding roads.<query> what is the steering wheel on a chevy rv</query> Front seats range from very good in the A5 to excellent in the S5, and the S line models fall in between. Any A5/S5 seat provides for hours of comfort and wiggle room while maintaining all the lateral support required to explore the car's capabilities. On the S5 the headrests are integral with the backrest and not adjustable, yet the head rest and neck protection are all in the right place and satisfactory for those well past six feet. Thigh extensions in the seat cushions let those tall drivers use more chair than just the area under their pants pockets, and there's plenty of leg room and a good dead pedal. A fast-slide switch on the front seat backrests eases access to the rear buckets which are nicely sculpted and comfortable for most up to 5-feet, 10-inches tall.<query> what is the difference between a5 and s5</query> A substantial armrest folds down over central storage trays and passengers are catered to with reading lights, two speakers per side, coat hooks, outboard storage pockets, cupholders, and a pair of vents with adjustable temperature control. To enlarge the cargo area the rear seat folds in a 50/50-split, allowing a pass-through into the passenger compartment for carrying longer items. The Cabriolet has a lightly revised rear seat but the side windows do roll down. A wind-blocker cuts buffeting in the front if you have no passengers. Ventilated front seats may be equipped with neck heating, enlarging the temperature range for comfortable al fresco motoring. The driver faces a tachometer and speedometer with smaller temperature and fuel gauges outboard in the two teardrop-shaped pods; in between, there's a bank of warning lights across the top and information display in the center.<query> what is the difference between a cabriolet and a chevy</query> This panel shows a variety of data, much of it chosen by the driver using the stalk and wheel controls; even on manual transmission cars it displays the gear selected in white and, if another gear offers the same performance on less gas, an arrow and a number for that gear in green. Night driving is further aided by deep amber illumination that offers the fastest recovery time for your eyes, smoked-lens vanity mirror lamps mounted in the roof, and shaded map lights that light your lap, not your eyes. A well-shaded screen for the MMI (multi-media interface) is located on the center stack and angled toward the driver. The MMI controls many of the car's functions and displays navigation maps and the rear camera view. MMI has a central control knob, somewhat like BMW iDrive and Mercedes COMAND systems.<query> where is the mmi located on a car</query>"

Why is a “3-way” switch? A 3-way switch enables one or more light fixtures to be operated from two different locations, for example, at opposite ends of a hallway or at the top and bottom of a stairway. The term “3-way” refers to the fact that there are three terminals on a 3-way switch, instead of the two terminals found on a standard on-off switch. What is the difference between an outlet and a receptacle? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Technically, an outlet is where a light or appliance is connected to the circuit's wires. A receptacle is the device that is often called an ""outlet,"" the cords for lamps, appliances, or other electrical equipment is plugged into.<query> what is the difference between a breaker and a receptacle</query> What is the difference between a device, a fixture, and an appliance? These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A fixture usually refers to a light that is permanently installed in a ceiling or a wall. An appliance refers to almost any electrically powered machine or apparatus that uses electricity. A device (e.g., switch, breaker, receptacle) is used to allow or interrupt the flow of current through the circuit to fixtures, appliances, or lamps. If some things are not working, where is the best place to begin looking for the problem? First check to see that the light or appliance in question is plugged in securely and that no bulbs are burned out. Then reset any breakers and GFCIs that may have tripped. You may need to look for an open (loose, corroded, broken) connection.<query> what is the difference between a fixture and an appliance</query> What is happening when lights or appliances will go out for a while and then come back on their own? This usually indicates a loose connection that makes contact intermittently, as when a wire is moved or pressure is applied to the connection. Loose connections can generate heat and may present a fire hazard. You can isolate the problem by moving the lamp or appliance to a different outlet to see if the problem lies with the lamp or the outlet. How can I tell if a circuit is overloaded? The most obvious indication that a circuit is overloaded is where the circuit breaker trips and then trips again after resetting it. If you are running several lights or appliances on the same circuit, first try shutting some of them off to see if that corrects the problem. If you are running several appliances on a surge strip or extension cord, check the label for the maximum number of watts that should be run on it.<query> what does it mean when a light goes out and comes back on its own</query> If the surge strip or extension cord is hot to the touch, stop using it immediately. What should I do if a circuit breaker trips when I am using a vacuum, hairdryer or other appliance? Appliances such as vacuums or hair dryers can draw a lot of power and may trip a circuit breaker. The simplest remedy is to turn off other appliances while using one of these appliances. If the problem persists, it may indicate that additional circuits should be added to handle the load. What should I do if I get a shock when touching a faucet or pipe? If you live near high-voltage power lines, those lines may create voltage in your pipes; the power company may or may not be able to help. Otherwise, the particular circuit responsible can be identified and the stray wire located. The grounding of those pipes should be checked.<query> what to do if a circuit breaker trips</query> What causes lights to flicker? Flickering lights usually indicate a poor connection in the light or contact somewhere in the circuit or in the panel. Finding the exact source of the problem-point can be difficult. It can be caused by a bad light socket or a poor electrical connection somewhere in the wires leading to the light (most likely right at the fixture). Flickering can cause the bad connection to get hot and may start a fire. If you cannot locate the cause of the flickering and it affects many or all lights, this could indicate a bad neutral connection, which can also be dangerous. Another indication of a neutral problem; as larger appliances (washing machines/dishwashers) cycle lights will get noticeably brighter or dimmer (minor changes in intensity are normal). If you suspect this problem have either the electric company or an electrician check it out.<query> what causes a light to flicker</query> What causes the lights to sometimes go dim or get extra bright? It’s not unusual for the lights to go dim or get bright when an appliance or motor goes on or off. What causes a light, switch, or breaker box to hum? Some dimmer switches will cause light fixtures to hum. At the breaker panel, the 60 cycles per second of your alternating current can set up a vibration or slight buzz or hum in some components. Fluorescent lights, transformers, and an electric water heater can also hum. All these are fairly normal, but if the hum is loud, it may mean that the component is loose or close to failing. If a circuit breaker gets wet, it can cause a buzzing sound as the moisture is boiled off. A loud buzzing at a breaker could indicate that the breaker overloading without tripping as it should.<query> what causes a light to hum</query> Should I be concerned if a switch or outlet gets hot? Yes. An outlet that is hot to the touch likely means that wires connecting to it are loose or that the outlet needs to be replaced. You should contact a licensed electrician immediately. A hot switch is usually a dimmer switch (it may or may not still be able to dim lights). If more than 600 watts of light bulbs are controlled by a single dimmer, it is probably overloaded. In that case, install a switch rated to handle more watts or replace the bulbs in the fixture with lower-wattage bulbs. Normally dimmers perform best when they control 80% of their rated load. A dimmer rated at 600 watts, means 480 watts is all the more load that dimmer should control. For example 8- 60 watt bulbs is all that should be connected to that dimmer.<query> what is the hot switch on a light switch</query> What causes a circuit breaker to get hot? It is normal for circuit breakers to be warm when current is running through them, but if one is hotter than the others, it may indicate a poor connection. If you have been running an appliance that draws a lot of current, (a space heater, for example) for an extended period, this would be normal, but the excess heat may trip the breaker. If there is a smell like burning plastic what might be happening? If you smell burning plastic from something electrical, it may indicate a poor connection that is creating heat, and melting the plastic housing of the outlet. Turn off whatever is plugged in and remove the plug. This presents a possible fire hazard and you should contact a licensed electrician immediately. Why do some light bulbs burn out more quickly than others?<query> why does my circuit breaker smell like plastic</query> There are several factors that may cause light bulbs to burn out quickly. Light bulbs that are used more often will, of course burn out faster. If the lights are left on a lot, such as an outdoor light that is left on all night, then the bulbs will have to be changed more often. Turning a bulb on and off frequently also reduces the life of the bulb. When a fixture cannot dissipate the heat of its bulbs, it takes a toll on the bulbs and on the fixture's sockets and wires. Or there may be loose connections in the wiring of a circuit. The packaging of any light bulb should have an average life expectancy printed on it. A typical light bulb will last roughly 900 hours. At 10 hours a day, that’s three months. Less expensive bulbs may be of lesser quality and not last as long.<query> how long do light bulbs last</query> If you compute the average life of your bulbs and discover it’s clearly less than the manufacturer’s rated life, this may be caused by: Over-voltage in your house. Occasionally this causes more serious problems. You can check the voltage in your home with an inexpensive multimeter available at most hardware or electronics stores. If the voltage is 125V or higher, contact your power company about it. 7 or 8 extra volts on a 120V line can dramatically reduce the life expectancy of a light bulb. If it’s a slight over-voltage, you can buy special 125V bulbs, though they may be hard to find. The life expectancy of a bulb will also be affected by the quality of power from the power company. This includes the little surges and spikes that are better known for their effect on computers. But it also includes the basic voltage level coming to the home from the utility.<query> what is the voltage of a light bulb</query> Electricity is simply a flow of electrons. Electricity is seen in nature in the form of lightning or in static electricity, such as you might experience by touching a metal doorknob after shuffling your feet on a carpeted floor. Electricity that we use in our daily lives is produced from a variety of sources, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or increasingly from wind turbines and photovoltaic solar arrays. The power is then distributed through a nationwide grid that balances production capacity with power demand. What is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage? Voltage pushes current through a resistance, using power (wattage). What is the relationship between amperes, ohms, watts, and volts? W (volts) push X amperes (current) through Y ohms (resistance), using Z watts.<query> what is the relationship between current, voltage, resistance, and wattage?</query> Many homes receive more than the average 120 volts that most bulbs are designed to handle and this shortens their stated life. A good solution to this is to look for the same bulb but with a ""130v"" rating stamped on the bulb instead of ""120v"". The light output of these won’t be quite as bright, but you will spend time changing bulbs. Too high a wattage bulb in too small an enclosed fixture (such as a globe). Because the heat cannot escape, the bulb will burn too hot, shortening bulb life. Recessed lighting fixtures covered by insulation, which blocks ventilation. Heat can build up around the bulb, causing short bulb life. Vibration bulbs in use under a stairway, on or near an out of balance bathroom or ceiling fan, or near a door that gets slammed, or any activity that sends vibration through the building can shorten bulb life Shock resistant, or “rough service” bulbs are one solution for this situation. .<query> what causes bulbs to shorten life</query> back to top GFCI Outlets What is a GFCI outlet? The initials “GFCI” stand for ground-fault circuit interrupter. A GFCI (or simply “GFCI”) outlet is a safety device that prevents dangerous electric shocks by cutting power to an outlet immediately when it detects a short circuit. For example, if water from a nearby sink is splashed on a GFCI outlet, the power would be cut to the outlet before a person could be shocked or electrocuted. In the home, GFCI outlets and breakers are typically found in kitchens, bathrooms and other locations where water is present. What does the light on a GFCI outlet indicate? Some newer GFCI outlets have lights, which may indicate different things on different brands. On some brands the light indicates that the GFCI is tripped and needs to be reset.<query> what is gfci</query> On other brands, the reverse is true, and the light indicates that the outlet is live. Can a circuit fail without tripping a breaker or a GFCI? Yes. A circuit can fail if a connection at the breaker or at the circuit's neutral wire in the electrical panel comes loose or deteriorates. More often these ""opens"" involve less than the entire circuit because a connection somewhere on the circuit—at another outlet box for example—has failed. Why won't a GFCI reset? A GFCI may fail to reset because of a ground-fault occurring at another outlet that is wired in sequence with the GFCI. A single GFCI device can protect as many as three additional outlets that are wired “downstream” of the GFCI. It could be the GFCI itself has no power reaching it because of a short or an open or another GFCI that is tripped upstream from it.<query> why won't a gfci reset</query> Tripped GFCIs made after 2002 cannot be reset if power is not reaching their line terminals. If a GFCI will not reset, should it be replaced? Possibly, but it is more common for a GFCI receptacle to retrip (or to not reset) for reasons other than a bad GFCI. A new GFCI installed in the same location may not reset either. There may be a ground-fault at some ""downstream"" wire or receptacle or electrical device. Your GFCI that won't reset could have been installed incorrectly recently; since 2002 GFCI receptacles have had a feature that won't let them reset if they are hooked up wrong or if power is not on. The typical service life of a GFCI is 6-10 years. GFCI outlets should be checked regularly to make sure they are functioning properly. How can you tell when a GFCI goes bad?<query> why won't my gfci reset</query> The most common way for a GFCI device to fail is that it will continue to supply power after you push the test button. When a GFCI fails, it no longer provides protection from dangerous electric shocks. GFCI devices made after 2002 will not reset if they are not receiving power. GFCI devices made before 2002, whose reset stays in, can fail to operate for the same reason — not receiving power. If a GFCI will not reset and/or retrips immediately after resetting, it may indicate a fault condition “downstream” from the GFCI, rather than a malfunction of the GFCI. What is the difference between a surge arrester and a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS)? These terms are often used interchangeably and rather loosely. However, the two terms have different meanings as defined by the National Electrical Code® (NEC®) (www.nfpa.org), their UL listing, and applicable IEEE/ANSI standards.<query> what is the difference between a surge arrester and a tvss</query> A secondary arrester refers to a surge protective device (SPD) that is listed for use ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility (the service entrance panel), while a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS) is only listed to be used after this primary disconnect. An SPD listed under UL1449 as a TVSS device must not be connected ahead of the primary disconnect to a facility. However, secondary surge arresters can be connected either upstream or downstream of the main disconnect back to top Dimmers What is the function of a dimmer? A dimmer provides the flexibility to vary the amount of light in a room depending on the size of the space, the time of day, and the task or activity being performed. Dimmers may be used almost anywhere: bathrooms, bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms, family rooms, game rooms, hallways, kitchens, living rooms, media rooms, or office or commercial spaces.<query> what is the purpose of a dimmer</query> What makes the lights dim? An electrical component in the dimmer, called a “triac” turns the light on and off very rapidly—120 times per second. But with a dimmer, the human eye perceives a steady level of dimmed light. The longer the light is “on” versus “off,” the brighter the light appears. Conversely, when the light is “off” more than “on,” the lights are dimmer. If the lights are being turned on and off, won’t the lights seem to be flickering? No. No matter how bright or how dim, the light level is constant and smooth. The human eye sees things after they go away. An example of this is in movies where the film is projected on the screen many times a second. Doesn’t turning the lights on and off so quickly decrease bulb life?<query> why do lights flicker</query> No. Switching the bulb does not decrease bulb life. Heat decreases bulb life, and by reducing heat, bulb life is increased. Do dimmers save electricity and/or increase lamp life? Yes. The longer the triac is off, the lower the light output, and the greater the energy savings. Dimmers can save electricity, save money and help increase the life of the lamps (light bulbs) being controlled. Dimmers can increase the life of incandescent bulbs and halogen bulbs (which are a type of incandescent bulb.) The table below shows the energy savings and increase in life of the lamp (light bulb) that can be achieved with dimmers. Percentage dimmed Energy savings Lamp life increase 10% 10% 2x 25% 20% 4x 50% 40% 20x 75% 60% >20x What light sources can be controlled by dimmers?<query> do dimmers save electricity</query> Most standard dimmers can control standard incandescent lamps that use 120 volts. Other dimmers can control low voltage xenon or halogen light sources that use 12 or 24 volts. Low voltage lighting systems use either an electronic or a magnetic transformer and there are dimmers specifically designed for each type of transformer. If the wrong type of dimmer is used, it will cause the low voltage light fixtures to flicker. Can one dimmer control both a line voltage light fixture AND a low voltage lighting system? If the low voltage lighting system uses an electronic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Likewise, if the low voltage lighting system uses a magnetic transformer, then a dimmer designed for this type of transformer should be used. Does dimming affect halogen bulb life? Yes. Dimming increases incandescent lamp life.<query> what type of dimmer is used for low voltage lighting</query> Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps with a tungsten filament. Lutron’s pilot test data suggests the halogen lamps will have an expected lamp life similar to other incandescent lamps when dimmed. As an example, one type of halogen lamp with a rated life of 2,000 hours dimmed to 80 V has a life extension of at least five times. Can neon/cold cathode lamps be dimmed? Yes. Neon/cold cathode lamps can be dimmed using the proper equipment. Lutron Nova low voltage dimmers and GRAFIC Eye controls are UL listed for neon/cold cathode loads. back to top Dimming CFLs and LEDs Dimming saves energy while setting the right light level to improve mood and ambiance. Screw-in compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and screw-in light emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) are a great energy-saving alternative to incandescent or halogen light sources; however, dimming them may be difficult.<query> can halogen lamps be dimmed</query> Amps times ohms = volts. Amps times volts = watts. How do I know if the wiring in my home is safe? If the wiring in your home was 1) installed by a professional electrician, 2) inspected and approved by your local electrical inspector, and 3) has not been modified or damaged, then your wiring should be safe. But, if for any reason you suspect that some of the wiring in your home is not safe, contact a professional electrician to identify and correct the problem. back to top Circuits and Circuit Breakers What is a circuit? A circuit is the actual or intended path of current between points of differing voltage. In the case of a conventional household 120 volt circuit, the path runs from the ""hot"" wire from the circuit breaker in the electrical panel, to an outlet or fixture and through a device or appliance that is using the electricity, then back to the breaker in the panel via a ""neutral"" wire connected to the grounded neutral bar in the panel.<query> what is the difference between volts and amps</query> Lutron’s new CFLâ€¢LED (Câ€¢Lâ„¢) Dimmers with HEDâ„¢ Technology help alleviate your CFL and LED dimming challenges. Challenges of dimming CFLs and LEDs with standard dimmers Energy-saving CFLs have been in the marketplace for many years but a broad range of dimmable bulbs has only recently become available. LEDs are even newer to the market and dimmable versions are also only recently available. These dimmable bulbs, especially CFLs, have historically presented problems when used on standard incandescent dimmers. Common problems include: Reduced dimming range: Incandescent/halogen bulbs will typically dim lower than CFL or LED bulbs. Most dimmable CFLs will dim down to 10% to 30% measured light output. Early versions of dimmable LEDs on the market have the ability to dim lower than CFLs and can reach levels as low as 5% to 15% measured light.<query> what is the difference between cfl and led</query> The actual dimming range is dictated by the bulb’s circuitry. Lights dropping out: As CFL or LED bulbs are dimmed, they will sometimes turn off before the slider reaches the bottom. Referred to as “drop out,” this makes it extremely difficult to set the dimmer at the right level without bulbs turning off. Lights not turning on: After being dimmed to a low light level and switched off, sometimes CFL or LED bulbs will not turn on until the dimmer’s slider is moved up. This is referred to as “pop-on,” which is especially challenging in 3-way situations where lights can be turned on/off from different locations, not just using the dimmer. Lights turning off unexpectedly: Dimmable CFL and LED bulbs can be influenced by line voltage fluctuations. As your incandescent bulbs will sometimes dim or flicker when a device such as air-conditioning or a hair dryer is used, a dimmed CFL or LED can actually turn off or flicker excessively in those situations.<query> why do cfl bulbs turn off</query> Note: Actual performance of any CFL or LED will vary from bulb type to bulb type and among different manufacturers. It is important to note that only bulbs that have been designed as dimmable should be used on a dimmer. To find out if your bulb is dimmable, please check the package, the bulb itself, or call the bulb manufacturer directly. Why do dimmers get warm, and is this safe? During normal operation, solid-state dimmers generate heat. A solid state dimmer is roughly 98% efficient—2% of the power is dissipated as heat, which causes the dimmer to feel warm to the touch. The closer a dimmer is run to full output and the higher the load (watts) on the dimmer, the warmer it will feel. This is perfectly normal and safe. Lutron dimmers are designed to the strictest UL safety standard, and can handle their full rated load (a 600 W dimmer can handle a full 600 W of power without overheating.<query> why do dimmer get warm</query> (Dimmers that are ganged together in a common wallbox may need to be derated.) What is “common neutral interaction”? Common neutral interaction occurs between at least two dimmers that share the same neutral wire. When solid-state dimmers are operating, voltage spikes occur and are transmitted onto the neutral wire. Normally this is of little concern. When the neutral wire is common (to 2 or more phases of a 3-phase, 4-wire system) the voltage spikes may feed back to the dimmers. The common neutral wire can cause interaction between the dimmers that are on different phases. The following are symptoms of common neutral interaction: Lights flicker at certain dimmer settings Lights flash to full output at certain dimmer settings Light level of a dimmer on 1 phase inadvertently changes when a dimmer on another phase is adjusted.<query> what is common neutral interaction</query> Lutron recommends the following methods to avoid common neutral interaction: Run separate neutral wires for each dimming circuit, from each dimmer’s load to the distribution panel Install a lamp debuzzing coil What is radio frequency interference (RFI)? RFI is a buzzing noise that may occur in some audio and radio equipment when solid state dimmers are used nearby. Although every Lutron dimmer contains a filter to suppress RFI, additional filtering may be required in some applications. Typical examples of RFI sensitive equipment are AM radios, stereo sound systems, broadcasting equipment, intercom systems, public address systems, and wireless telephones. back to top LED Lights What is an LED light? LED stands for Light Emitting Diode. A diode is a semiconductor that allows current to flow in only one direction. Semiconductor diodes are a junction of two materials, one with a positive and the other with a negative charge.<query> what is rfi</query> When this PN junction is applied with a forward voltage, electrons and holes are brought together releasing light energy. Hence: Light Emitting Diode. What is the difference between an incandescent bulb and an LED bulb? Incandescent bulbs creates light when current is run through a filament. Resistance in the filament generates heat, which causes it to glow and produces light. LEDs create light when power is applied to semiconductors (usually gallium, arsenic and phosphorous), which are stimulated by the movement of electrons, creating visible light. How does the brightness of LED lighting compare to incandescent lighting? LED light bulbs are much brighter than incandescent or halogen bulbs of the same wattage, but LED bulbs are not available in very high wattages. Thus, when replacing incandescent or halogen lamps with LED lamps, more LED lamps are often needed.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and led light bulbs</query> For example, replacing one 100-watt incandescent bulb may require two 5-watt or 6-watt LED bulbs. Nevertheless, LED lights can save up to 85% of the electricity used by a traditional incandescent bulb. How bright are LED light bulbs? The brightest LED bulbs produce light comparable to a 120-watt incandescent bulb while only consuming the electricity of a 25 watt incandescent bulb. LED bulbs available for standard fixtures vary in brightness from less than 50 lumens up to about 1200 lumens. The brightest LED bulbs for standard fixtures are floodlights and spotlights. The brightest LED bulbs with approximately the same size and shape as ordinary incandescent bulbs produce up to 600 lumens. Are bulbs with more LEDs brighter than bulbs with less? Different types of LEDs vary greatly in size and light output and the number of LEDs does not determine brightness.<query> what is the brightest led light bulb</query> The most accurate indicators of the brightness of LED bulbs are the measured lumens or lux. Lumens measure the total amount of light output from a bulb. Lux measures how bright the light is on a surface at a specified distance. How efficient are LED bulbs compared to incandescent bulbs? Newer LED light bulbs are more than five times as efficient as comparable incandescent bulbs. In addition, because LED bulbs direct a larger percentage of light where it is needed, in some applications they are as much as ten times as effective as incandescent bulbs, reducing energy use by 90%. Why do LEDs use such little power? LEDs do not use a filament where a conductor is heated and light is created. Filament based lighting consumes more power than the light produced. LEDs produce very little heat and do not use filaments, making them far more efficient in consumption and output.<query> how efficient are led lights</query> In addition, incandescent bulbs project light in every direction (omni directional) as opposed to LED lights which project light in specified directions (such as 20, 50 and 120 degrees) due to their package design and layout. What is the useful life of LED bulbs? High quality, white LED bulbs typically last for 50,000 hours. By contrast, most traditional incandescent bulbs have a useful life of 1,000 hours and halogen bulbs typically last about 3,000 hours. And an average compact fluorescent bulb typically lasts for 10,000 hours. In an average home, if an LED bulb burned from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. 365 days a year, it would last more than 25 years. But unlike other types of lights, LED bulbs slowly decrease in brightness over time, rather than burning out suddenly. Near the end of its service life, an LED bulb will typically put out only 70% of its original light.<query> how long do led lights last</query> Higher quality LED lights have design features that enable them to burn brighter, longer. Can LED lights be used with a dimmer? LED lights that are dimmable indicate on the package or website. Make sure you check with the manufacturer of the LED for dimmer compatibility. What is an LED driver? An LED driver is a self-contained power supply that has outputs matched to the electrical characteristics of the LED or array of LEDs. Drivers should be current-regulated (deliver a consistent current over a range of load voltages). Dimmable LED drivers may also offer dimming by means of pulse width modulation (PWM) circuits. Drivers may have more than one channel for separate control of different LEDs or arrays. Are outdoor LEDs affected by extreme weather conditions? LED lights are designed to function in temperatures from -40F to 180F, exceeding the conditions where most incandescent and florescent bulbs will fail.<query> what is led driver</query> A typical home has many circuits, with each individual circuit supplying power to a number of outlets or fixtures. A single room may receive power from two or more circuits. Technically, each loop that current makes (through a single light and its switch, for example) is a circuit, but the most common meaning is the ""branch circuit"", that is, everything fed (or interrupted) by a given breaker or fuse. Do circuit breakers ever go bad or wear out? Yes, but not very often. When a breaker will not reset, the cause may be a short that is retripping it immediately or you may not be resetting it properly. Circuit breakers have toggle switches with three positions: on, off, and tripped. When the breaker is tripped, you must move the toggle switch all the way to the off position before moving it to the on position.<query> what is the difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker</query> In addition, while florescent bulbs need to warm up to achieve full brightness in cold weather, there is no warm up time needed for LEDs. Is it true that LED lights do not attract insects? Generally, yes. Most insects cannot see the spectrum of light produced by LEDs. Are LED diodes inherently directional? LED diodes are not inherently directional. One way to boost light intensity is to focus the beam more tightly. This is accomplished with a lens that directs light. MR and PAR series LEDs have a beam angle of 15 to 60 degrees. This does not change the light output, only the direction of the light. Do LEDs produce heat? LEDs ordinarily produce only a fraction of the heat produced by incandescent bulbs. If LEDs are hot to the touch, they are poorly designed being overpowered due to improper circuitry.<query> do led lights attract insects</query> What does CRI stand for? The color rendering index (CRI) (sometimes called color rendition index), is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully compared to a natural light source. Why are LEDs different colors? The color of an LED is a function of the material used to make the junction. There are two main materials used in visible light LED junctions: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN): used to make up the blue, white, true green, and UV types Aluminum gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP or AlInGaP): used to make the red, yellow, and orange types Are LEDs available in “warm” and “cool” light output, like traditional lights? How do you make a white LED? Yes. LED lights can be “tuned” to look warm or cool by adjusting the amounts of colors in the mix or by using a blue LED with a phosphor coating.<query> what is the color of led</query> The coating emits a yellow light when the blue light from the LED shines on it. The mix of the yellow light with the blue light forms a white light. Inefficiency in the phosphor conversion is one reason that a white LED is less efficient overall than a colored LED. Some of the light energy is lost in the conversion to yellow. What is the difference between an LED floodlight and a spotlight? LED spotlights put out a narrower beam of light than a floodlight, typically less than 45 degrees wide. LED floodlights put out a wider beam of light, up to 120 degrees A spotlight is more suited to illuminating objects and a floodlight is more suited to illuminating areas. back to top Dark Sky Regulated Lights What are Dark Sky Regulated Lights? Growing populations have increased the need for lighting ten-fold in the past 25 years.<query> what is the difference between a led floodlight and led spotlight</query> “Dark sky” regulations are intended to reduce “light pollution” caused by the over-lighting of various places in the city such as streets, parking lots, and decorative lighting. What is light pollution and why is it important? Light pollution indicates wasted energy. Light pollution blocks the view of stars and other celestial bodies. Light pollution is not limited to big cities, and is a concern beyond astronomers and dark sky enthusiasts. You experience light pollution when you can’t sleep at night because of a neighbor’s outdoor light, when a driver’s headlights are too intense for your dark-adjusted eyes and the glare becomes blinding, and can also have an adverse effect on wildlife. Dark sky regulated lights cut glare and prevent light trespass that will reduce sky glow and thus waste less energy. Glare, light trespass and sky glow are those components of wasted for outdoor lighting.<query> why is it important to have a dark sky</query> What is glare? Glare affects motorists at night when the high-beam lights of an oncoming car makes it difficult to see. Resolve this by aiming lights down or using a visor to shield the light from people’s eyes. What is light trespass? Light trespass refers to bright light that intrudes on neighboring property. An example would be light from a commercial parking lot that shines into a window or back yard, limiting the use of the yard in the evening. Dark sky regulations require the lights to be aimed down or shielded so the light is limited to a specific spot, or motion sensors. This also affects wildlife. What is sky glow? People living in large cities rarely see the dark night sky because of sky glow. Sky glow can adversely affect wildlife and limit the enjoyment of the night sky.<query> what is the definition of light trespass</query> Sky glow, virtually always indicates wasted energy. Properly installed outdoor lighting will prevent this. (For more information on dark sky regulations, visit www.darksky.org). What is being done to address the problem? Many neighborhood associations and community leaders are trying to preserve our natural dark skies, especially in areas near wildlife and state parks. Many communities are passing legislation to regulate the use and design of outdoor lighting. Such lighting equipment is often referred to as Dark Sky Compliant, Cut-off Lighting, Friendly Lighting or Good Neighbor Lighting, Dark Sky Regulated. These names all refer to fixtures that are designed to reduce upward light reflection, glare, trespassing light, inefficient energy use and urban sky glow. The lighting industry has responded by creating light fixtures that consumers can easily install with little modification to their existing systems.<query> what is the purpose of the light fixture</query> This response has allowed dark sky compliance to be more accessible to the general public. Simple technologies and modifications to outdoor fixtures like motion-sensor activated flood lights, timers; hoods and reflectors even using focused lights in lower wattages can help. back to top Energy Star What is Energy Star? Energy Star is a government program dedicated to awareness and the promotion of energy efficient products for both consumers and manufacturers. The Energy Star program is administered jointly by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Energy Star identifies and recommends products with the highest industry standards of quality and low-energy consumption. Products with the Energy Star label use less energy and therefore save the user money on electricity. For example, on average, fluorescent lights use only 2/3 as much energy as their incandescent counterparts, and some last up to 10 times longer.<query> what is energy star</query> The extra accost of compact fluorescent bulbs will be exceeded in cost savings over the life of the bulb. In addition, because Energy Star products use less energy, they also help reduce air pollution from power generators. (For more information visit:www.energystar.gov.) Doesn’t energy efficient equal ugly, industrial and bulky? No. More efficient lighting does not mean less light or less attractive lighting. New lighting technology provides both equal illumination and the choice of “warm” or “cool” light available in traditional lighting. Some early models of efficient lights featured large, bulky bulbs and humming ballasts, but these problems are all in the past. Energy efficient lighting is now available in almost any style and for any application, and new technologies such as LED lights are becoming more common and more affordable every day.<query> why are energy efficient bulbs used</query> Is energy efficient lighting as safe as traditional lighting? Yes. In addition, fluorescent and LED lights are much cooler to the touch than regular halogen and incandescent lights and thus are less of a fire hazard. What else can I do to be more energy efficient? Research energy efficient solutions available in your community. Many communities now issue rebates or other incentive including free upgrades to switch over to more energy efficient fixtures. Many local environmental agencies provide consumer tips on saving energy and money. Small modifications such as timers, motion-sensors, photo-cells as well as solar energy can help the environment. Simply shutting off a light when you leave the room makes a great difference if a million people do it. Especially in the summer and winter months, there are high demands on electricity. Small things like installing a ceiling fan and reversing the fan’s direction during the winter months to distribute trapped heat from the ceiling.<query> what is the best way to conserve energy</query> In the summer, cool only those areas of the house that are actually in use. back to top Smoke Alarms Why should my home have smoke alarms? In the event of a fire, properly installed and maintained smoke alarms provide an early warning so people can escape in time. Smoke alarms are one of the most effective safety devices you can buy and install to protect yourself, your family and your home. What types of smoke alarms are available? There are many different brands of smoke alarms on the market but they fall under two basic types: ionization and photoelectric. Ionization alarms sound more quickly when a flaming, fast moving fire occurs. Photoelectric smoke alarms are better at sensing smoldering smoky fires. There are also combination smoke alarms, called dual sensor smoke alarms, that combine ionization and photoelectric into one unit.<query> what type of alarms are there</query> If the breaker will not reset after repeated attempts, it is best to call a professional electrician. How much area can be served by one circuit? How many outlets can be wired on one GFCI? A 15-amp circuit should not serve over more than 600 square feet of a home. A 20-amp circuit should not serve more than 800 square feet. Some GFCI manufacturers recommend no more than eight outlets downstream. A lengthy series of GFCI loads can trip the GFCI. If that is suspected, each such load outlet could be given its own GFCI receptacle, connected to protect only itself. What is the difference between hot, neutral, and ground wires? Typical electrical cable includes a minimum of three wires: hot, neutral, and ground. The “hot” wire, which is usually black in color, carries current from the power source, such as a home’s electrical panel, to a switch, outlet or fixture.<query> how many outlets can be on a gfci</query> Because both ionization and photoelectric smoke alarms are better at detecting distinctly different yet potentially fatal fires, the U.S. Fire Administration recommends the installation of both ionization and photoelectric or dual sensor smoke alarms. In addition to alarms that provide an audible warning, there are alarms people with hearing disabilities. These alarms may use strobe lights that flash and/or vibrate to alert those who are unable to hear standard smoke alarms when they sound. Where should smoke alarms be placed? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Since smoke and many deadly gases rise, smoke alarms are usually installed on the ceiling or high on a wall close to the ceiling. Smoke alarms should be installed on every level of the home, including the basement. For extra safety, install smoke alarms both inside and outside of sleeping areas. Are smoke alarms hard to install?<query> where should smoke alarms be placed</query> If your smoke alarms are hard wired, that is, wired into the home’s electrical system, you will need to have a qualified electrician do the initial installation or install replacements. Battery-powered smoke alarms can usually be installed with simple hand tools. Some models can even be installed with adhesives. For all smoke alarm installations, be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation. In some localities, fire departments will help install a smoke alarm in your home for you. Call your local fire department (on a non-emergency telephone number) if you have questions about installing a smoke alarm. How do I keep my smoke alarm working? In standard-type battery powered smoke alarms, It’s important to test every smoke alarm monthly and replace the batteries with new ones at least once a year.<query> how to install a smoke alarm</query> The whole unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. Helpful tip: Choose a day that is easy to remember, such as a holiday or birthday and replace the batteries each year on that day. Most smoke alarms make a “chirping” sound to signal that the batteries need to be replaced. Smoke alarms powered by long-lasting batteries are designed to replace the entire unit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Hard wired smoke alarms may or may not have battery backup. For hard-wired, battery back-up smoke alarms, just as with a battery-only model, the batteries should be checked monthly, and replaced at least once per year. The entire unit should be replaced every 8-10 years. How long do smoke alarms last? Most alarms installed today have a life span of about 8-10 years.<query> how often should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> After this time, the entire unit should be replaced. It is a good idea to write the date of purchase with a marker on the inside of your alarm so you will know when to replace it. Some smoke alarms have the date of manufacture printed on a label inside the unit. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for replacement. What if the alarm goes off while I’m cooking? Do not disable the smoke alarm if it goes off because of cooking or other non-fire causes. Instead, fan the air near the smoke alarm, leaving the batteries in place. If this happens often, the alarm may need to be moved to a new location. Some of the newer models have a “hush” button that silences nuisance alarms. Also consider a photoelectric smoke detector for this area. The U.S. Fire Administration recommends the following fire safety and prevention practices.<query> when should a smoke alarm be replaced</query> Plan and practice escape plans several times a year and designate a safe meeting place. Never change your meeting place. Make sure your whole family knows when and how to call emergency telephone numbers from outside the house or neighbors. Install a fire extinguisher on each floor of the house and learn how to use it. Install carbon monoxide detectors. If you are building a new home or planning a major remodel, consider installing residential fire sprinklers. Contact your local fire department on a non-emergency phone number is you need help or have questions about fire safety in your home. back to top Carbon Monoxide What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, invisible gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels such as natural gas, propane, wood, charcoal, gasoline, kerosene, and oil.<query> what is the difference between carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide</query> In the home, carbon monoxide can be formed from the incomplete combustion from any flame-fueled (i.e., not electric) device, including ranges, ovens, clothes dryers, furnaces, fireplaces, grills, space heaters, and water heaters. Furnaces and water heaters may be sources of carbon monoxide, but if they are vented properly the carbon monoxide will escape to the outside. Open flames, such as from ovens or ranges, are the most common source of carbon monoxide. Vehicles are the most common source of carbon monoxide poisoning. Running a car in a closed garage—especially an attached garage—can be extremely dangerous. If you are doing mechanical work on a car in a garage, leave the overhead door open or attach an air hose to vent the exhaust to the outside. How do carbon monoxide detectors work? Carbon monoxide detectors trigger an alarm based on an accumulation of carbon monoxide over time.<query> what is the most common source of carbon monoxide</query> Carbon monoxide can harm you if you are exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide in a short period of time, or to lower levels of carbon monoxide over a long period of time. Carbon monoxide detectors require a continuous power supply, so if the power cuts off then the alarm becomes ineffective. Models are available that offer back-up battery power. Why is carbon monoxide dangerous? When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it interferes with the oxygen transport and gas exchange abilities of red blood cells. Low levels of carbon monoxide poisoning cause symptoms similar to those of the flu or a cold, including shortness of breath on mild exertion, headaches and nausea. Higher levels of poisoning lead to dizziness, mental confusion, severe headaches, nausea, and fainting on mild exertion. Ultimately, carbon monoxide poisoning can result in unconsciousness, permanent brain damage and death.<query> why is carbon monoxide dangerous</query> Carbon monoxide detectors are set to sound an alarm before the exposure to carbon monoxide would present a healthy adult. Babies, children, pregnant women, people with circulatory or respiratory ailments, and the elderly are more sensitive to carbon monoxide than healthy adults. Where should I place a carbon monoxide detector? Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on placement. Because carbon monoxide is slightly lighter than air and also because it may be found with warm, rising air, detectors should be placed on a wall at least five feet above the floor or on the ceiling. Do not place the detector near a fireplace or flame-producing appliance, such as a gas stove. A carbon monoxide detector should be installed on each floor of the house, especially near sleeping areas. What do I do if the alarm sounds? The alarm is designed to go off before you experience symptoms.<query> where should carbon monoxide detectors be placed</query> Silence the alarm, get all members of the household to fresh air, and if anyone is experiencing symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, call 911. If no one has symptoms, ventilate the building, identify and remedy the source of the carbon monoxide before returning inside and have appliances or chimneys checked by a professional. How often should a carbon monoxide detector be replaced? The average life span of many carbon monoxide detectors is about two years. Be aware that the “test” feature on many detectors checks the functioning of the alarm but not the ability of the detector to detect carbon monoxide. Some detectors last longer than others, indicate when they need to be replaced, and have power supply backups. When purchasing a carbon monoxide detector, consider not only the number and type of possible carbon monoxide sources, but also the construction of the building.<query> how often should carbon monoxide detectors be replaced</query> Newer buildings may have more airtight construction and may be better insulated, which makes it easier for carbon monoxide to accumulate. back to top Attic Fans How do I calculate the size fan I need for an attic? Measure the square footage of your attic (length X width) and multiply that figure by 0.7. This will give you the minimum CFM (cubic feet per minute—the measure of air volume moved by the fan) rating required for your attic. Add 15 percent for dark covered roofs. Choose a fan with a CFM rating appropriate for your attic size to ensure adequate ventilation. How much free area air intake is needed for an attic fan to work properly? Divide the CFM required by 300 and then multiply the result by 144 (one square foot, in inches) to give you the square inches of free air area required.<query> how to calculate attic fan size</query> The neutral wire, which is usually white in color, carries current back to the electrical panel. (Recall that electricity needs to flow in a circular path.) The ground wire, which is usually bare of insulation, carries no current at all under normal circumstances. The ground wire is there for safety. It provides an alternative route for current and allows the current to be discharged into the ground in case there is a short circuit. Why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester? When a neutral wire is not continuous back to the panel as it should be, the current of the hot wire goes through anything that is ready to run (but won't) and shows up on the normally-neutral wire. What is the difference between an open, an overload, a short, and a ground-fault?<query> why would a neutral wire read live on a circuit tester?</query> How do I calculate the existing free air in my attic? If you have eave vents or gable vents, multiply the length by width of each vent to get the square inches, (if the opening is covered with a screen, divide by 2) The net free area may be stamped on the frame of the vent. Add up all the totals from all of the vents to get your total existing free air area. If there is not enough free air area in the attic, additional vents should be added to ensure that the attic fan is working at optimal efficiency. Do attic exhaust fans come with a thermostat? Yes. All attic exhaust fans are equipped with a thermostat. What temperature should the thermostat of an attic fan/ventilator be set on? Attic fan thermostats are usually set at about 110 degrees F., depending on the climate.<query> how to calculate free air in attic</query> If the fan seems to be running too much, raise the thermostat setting by 10 degrees. Can the dome of an attic ventilator be painted? If so, what kind of paint should be used? Yes. The dome may be painted with any latex-based exterior house paint. Can a variable speed control switch be used with an attic exhaust fan? The Broan model 72 variable speed control can be used with the Broan model 350, 353, 355, and 350 attic fans. (The model #356 cannot be used with a variable speed control.) Can a gable exhaust fan be installed on a roof? No. Gable fans are designed to be installed only on vertical locations. Do roof fans have bird guards installed? Yes. Bird screens are incorporated into the individual roof exhaust fans.<query> what kind of paint to use on an attic fan</query> Can a roof fan be installed on a vertical surface? No. Roof exhaust fans are designed to be installed on horizontal or sloping surfaces. Broan-NuTone gable fans are designed for vertical installations. Can an attic exhaust fan be installed on a flat roof? Yes. Note that a waterproof curb will need to be built so that the housing is higher and snow and water levels would not affect product performance. Can I install a dehumidistat to the attic ventilator? Yes. Use model DH100W by Broan. What is a “sone,” and how is it measured? A sone is a unit of measure for sound that refers to a comfortable hearing level for an average listener. The lower the sone value, the more comfortable the listening environment. One sone is the equivalent of a quiet refrigerator. Sones are not decibels or volume, but rather how sound is ""sensed,"" including factors such as pitch and frequency.<query> what is sone</query> For example, the sound of a car equipped with speakers that produce very low bass notes can be extremely disagreeable more because of the vibration, than because of the actual volume of the music. back to top Exhaust Fans What is continuous ventilation? Continuous ventilation provides today’s tightly constructed homes with a relatively constant and controlled level of ventilation. Broan QT Series ventilators are very quiet and efficient and are ideally suited for these applications. Can Broan fans be mounted directly above a tub or shower? Most Broan fans are rated for use over a shower or bathtub when used with a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter). Can a ceiling fan be surrounded by insulation? Yes. Broan bath fans are designed to provide adequate cooling for motors and lighting, as well as products with integral heaters. Will Broan fans work in wall-mount applications?<query> what is broan ventilation</query> Some Broan bath and utility fans may be wall mounted. See the spec matrix for specific models. Can a ceiling fan or wall-mount utility fan serve as a kitchen range hood? No. Range hoods are specifically designed to handle grease and high temperature environments. Ventilation provided by NuTone fans is only a supplement for odor and moisture removal in the kitchen. What is ""static pressure""? Static pressure is a measure of resistance to airflow as it is pushed through ductwork. Static pressure reduces the effectiveness of the fan. Static pressure increases with the length and the number of turns in the ductwork. Learn more on the Home Ventilation Institute web site www.hvi.org. How long should a bath fan run after a shower is used? The Home Ventilation Institute recommends that a fan should run for 20 minutes to clear humidity adequately and to minimize moisture and condensation in the fan body and ducting.<query> what is the static pressure of a bathroom fan</query> Is there a timer available that will turn off a fan automatically after 20 minutes? Broan has sensing fans that detect the humidity rise caused by a shower and turn on automatically. When moisture has cleared it turns off. Some wall controls also give you the option of humidity sensing or timer control. What are the timer features? Delay-off timers automatically shut your fan off after a specified time interval. This is a useful feature in high traffic bathrooms where you may wish to let the fan run to clear moisture adequately. A timer counts the minutes of fan operation selected by the user. Where should the bathroom exhaust fan be located? Exhaust fans should be located in or near the shower or tub, and in any enclosed room with a toilet. Keep exhaust points opposite the supply air source to ensure that the fresh air is drawn through the room.<query> where should bathroom exhaust fan be located</query> Bathroom doors should not be sealed too tightly at the bottom in order to allow replacement air to enter the room when the door is closed. Where is the exhaust outlet on a ventilation fan? The exhaust outlet is the point where air is discharged through the body of the fan housing into the ductwork. During installation, the fan should be oriented with the exhaust outlet pointing toward the exit vent on the roof or wall to minimize turns in ductwork that impede airflow. Why do windows and mirrors fog up even when the fan is running? If windows and mirrors are cold, condensation can still form on these surfaces. If a bathroom is sealed tightly, replacement air may not be entering the room fast enough to displace the moist air. Fan placement can also be a factor. Fans should be located far enough from the source of replacement air to ensure the moist air is drawn out first.<query> why do bathroom fans fog up</query> Too many twists and turns in the ducting will significantly reduce the ability of the blower to remove moist air. Make sure that ductwork is as short and straight as possible, with gradual turns rather than tight corners where necessary. Why is water dripping from the grille of the fan? Dripping water can be caused by either condensation (usually due to cold ductwork or improper duct installation), or a problem with the seal on a wall or roof vent. Insulated ductwork can help solve condensation problems, and running the fan longer will ensure that moisture is completely removed from the duct. If possible, ductwork should slope down toward a wall vent to direct condensation out of the exterior vent opening rather than back into the fan housing. Can I install a heater directly over the bathtub or in a shower? No.<query> why does my shower fan drip water</query> Heaters are not UL listed (Underwriter's Laboratory) for installation over bathtubs or in a shower. Can I use an inline or multi-port fan in one large bathroom? Yes, this works the best for large rooms because you can install the ports over the areas where the ventilation is needed the most (source control). The size of the multi-port would be determined by the size of the room. Does a duct-free bath fan expel air? No. A duct-free fan only circulates the air in the room. It is not a ventilating device and does not remove air from the room. What type of exhaust fan is recommended for indoor sauna or hot tub areas? A high-CFM rated device is normally recommended for this type of application. Can I use a smaller diameter duct than what the fan is designed for?<query> can a bathtub fan be used over a shower</query> This is not recommended. Undersized ductwork will cause the fan to run harder, greatly reducing the CFM performance of the fan and create excess noise. Can larger diameter ducting be used with my bath fan? Yes, larger diameters ducting will improve the performance of your fan. What type of duct is recommended, rigid or flexible? Rigid ductwork is recommended, where possible. Rigid ductwork has less resistance to air flow and allows the fan to operate much more efficiently. If flexible ducting is used, be sure the duct is as straight as possible. Can a bathroom fan be vented into an attic instead of out the roof or wall? Never direct exhaust air into spaces within walls, ceilings, attics, crawl spaces or garages. The humidity may damage the structure and insulation. Can I use a fan in a steam shower?<query> what type of ductwork is used for bathroom fan</query> An open is when a circuit's path is disrupted. An overload is when current on a circuit is excessive. A short is when current takes an unintended path to ground (usually with very little resistance). A ground-fault is when such a short does not use the neutral as its path to ground. What is an open ground? An open neutral? Reverse polarity, etc.? Measured at an outlet's receptacle, the path (wire continuity) to the ground point in the panel can be disrupted or missing for the ground wire (open ground) or for the neutral (open neutral). When the path between the outlet and its circuit breaker is disrupted, this is an “open hot.” Reverse polarity (hot and neutral reversed) means neutral wires are connected to the side of the receptacle that is supposed to be for the hot, and vice versa.<query> what is an open ground</query> No. Since these are normally sealed chambers, a vacuum will be created. Can more than one bath fan be vented out of a single roof or wall cap? Usually not. Always follow the manufacturer's recommended ventilation requirements. back to top Ceiling Fans How high should ceiling fans be mounted from the floor? Typically want to install them 8 to 9 feet off the ground Ceiling Height 9’ 10’ 11’ 12’ 13’ 15’ Down rod Length 12” 18” 24” 36” 48” 72” back to top NuTone Central Vacuum What size power unit should I use? Power units are designed for different applications and for varying square footage requirements of residences. For greatest efficiency, place the power unit as low as possible in the system. How many inlets may be installed in a system?<query> how high should ceiling fans be mounted</query> It is recommended to keep the number of inlets to the minimum needed for convenient use. But you may install as many as you require, assuming all are in proper working condition with tight seals and gaskets. What inlets should be used? Depending on the application and the power unit model will dictate which inlets are utilized for the installation. Things to consider are styling and color. The Advantage Series offers a status indicating feature and Broan-NuTone also offers a direct connect electrified inlet. Where should I locate my wall inlet valves? If you are using one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses the wall valve inlets should be located within six feet of a household power receptacle. We suggest that you take a 25 foot length of cord or a measuring tape set to 25 feet then walk though your home and locate your wall inlets so that they cover all the areas you wish to vacuum.<query> where are the inlet valves located</query> Are Broan-NuTone Vacuum components compatible with other makes? Some Broan-NuTone's components may be compatible with other makes. Call Broan-NuTone Technical Support for verification before you buy any component. What are “air watts”? “Air watts” refers to a combination of air flow and vacuum water lift created by the power unit. The greater the air watts, the greater the cleaning ability of the system. Is it necessary to exhaust the power unit to the outside? For the best indoor air quality, Broan-NuTone recommends venting the exhaust to the outside. This is not mandatory, but is recommended for a complete installation. One advantage of a central vacuum system is its ability to vacuum up all items and microscopic particles that may not be captured by the primary filter (bag).<query> what is the difference between a vacuum and a central vacuum</query> The remaining particles will then be vented to outside through the exhaust duct. Can regular PVC plumbing be used for central vacuum tubing? No. Broan-NuTone uses special thin wall tubing that must be used to ensure proper fit of inlets, hoses and other components, and for proper operation of the system. What is cyclonic action? Cyclonic action is a special feature that forces dust and debris to the bottom of the power unit's canister, allowing the power unit to operate at peak effectiveness. What is the difference between Turbo powered vacuum cleaning heads and electric powered cleaning heads? Turbo powered heads use some of the power unit's suction to operate the cleaning head. The electric cleaning heads use all of the power unit's suction for cleaning. In order to use the electric cleaning heads you must use one of Broan-NuTone's current carrying hoses.<query> what is cyclonic action</query> When is a power brush or power head required? Broan-NuTone recommends using a power brush to clean carpet. The power brush loosens dirt for proper cleaning and separates and lifts the nap of the carpet to keep it in top condition and proper appearance. Are the turbine air brushes operationally equivalent to the power brushes? Yes. The air-driven turbine is a uniquely designed, non-electric brush for cleaning with the central vacuum system. The electric power brush maintains constant brush action by using of the motor used to run the unit. Is a dedicated electrical circuit required for a central vacuum power unit installation? Yes. The central vacuum system requires its own 15 or 20 amp circuit, depending on the specific power unit you are installing. My central vacuum has lost a lot of its suction. What is the most likely cause?<query> what is the power brush for central vacuum</query> A dirty motor filter may be the cause of poor system performance. Other problems that cause poor system performance are leaky wall valve inlets, blockages in the intake or exhaust piping, or a blockage in the hose. Consult your owner’s manual or call Broan-NuTone Technical support for assistance. How do you remove the power unit’s motor filter? First remove the dust collection canister. After locating the motor filter, grasp the flexible band that holds the filter in place and then pull it to the center of the filter, and it should come free. If you have trouble call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. How can I clear a blockage in the vacuum system? Clearing a blockage in the system can be quite a challenge. You can rent a plumber's snake and then work it through the system piping. Sometimes a small diameter hose worked through your piping may clear a blockage.<query> how to remove motor filter</query> Why does the system keep running even when the hose is removed and the power unit's switch is turned off? The most likely cause is incorrect wiring to your wall valve inlets. Disengage one of the system wires on the front of your power unit and if the system shuts down then you need to verify that the wiring to your wall valve inlets is correct. If the problem persists, call Broan-NuTone Technical Support. back to top Service & Support Contact Support FAQs Video Library National Accounts Finance Credit Application Product Recalls Freight Claims Tax Exempt Forms Markets Construction Data Comm.

Voltage drop in an electrical circuit normally occurs when current is passed through the wire. Even the best conductors of electricity, such as copper wire, offer some resistance to the flow of current. This resistance causes a drop in voltage. The greater the resistance of the circuit, the higher the voltage drop. How much voltage drop is acceptable? A voltage drop of 5% at the furthest receptacle in a branch circuit is acceptable for normal efficiency. In a 120 volt, 15 amp circuit, this means that there should be no more than a 6 volt drop (114 volts) at the furthest outlet when the circuit is fully loaded. At what percentage voltage drop does a circuit become hazardous? That depends on several factors: The amount of current flowing through the high resistance connection The amount of resistance of that connection Proximity or contact with combustible materials Available air flow to dissipate heat What causes excessive voltage drop in a branch circuit?<query> what is the voltage drop in a circuit</query> Excessive voltage drop is usually caused by: High resistance connections at wiring junctions or outlet terminals, including: Poor splices anywhere in the circuit Loose or corroded connections anywhere in the circuit Inadequate seating of wire in the slot connection on push-in type receptacles and switches The wire does not meet code (i.e., not heavy enough gauge for the length of the run). What are the consequences of excess voltage drop in a circuit? Excess voltage drop can cause: Inadequate power, causing improper, erratic or no operation—and damage to the equipment being powered. Poor efficiency and wasted energy. Build-up of heat at the high resistance connection or splice, which may be a fire hazard. What is the difference between a switch and a circuit breaker? A switch is a device that interrupts the flow of electricity.<query> what is the cause of voltage drop</query>"

And where are they today? Some are stuffed in a folder, but I’d say 90% are sitting in a landfill, surrounded by seagulls cawing and grabbing at pieces of trash. It’s sad to think about in retrospect.<query> when did green greeting cards come out</query> Aunt Diane’s 11th birthday greeting is bird food. Sorry Aunt Diane. In this new world where greenies are taking over, innovation is something not to be overlooked. Brynne Cogorna, owner of Backward Prints is one such innovator. “I started an eco-friendly greeting card line using paper that is tree-free and grows flowers once watered and planted.” Seriously? That’s adorable. A greeting card that grows flowers, I love the green revolution. And what I like most about Brynne is that she is a local artist trying to make a difference. “I graduated from the University of Colorado last year. I am just trying to save the earth. I think living in Boulder for 4 1/2 years set a spark off inside of me...” she said. Her designs are not hyped or flashy, rather they are simple, sending the simple, world-wide message of love.<query> who is the owner of backward prints</query> So, come happy birthday, happy anniversary, thank you or a simple hello, one thing is for sure, this year I am sending, peace, love and some ever so green tidings. Check out Brynne’s cards at http://noelart.biz/. Having traveled around the world, Beryl Shereshewsky, a recent University of Colorado, Boulder graduate, realized that in life, she wanted to accomplish three things. One, travel more, two, write about what she saw and three, save the world. With the recent advances in the green movement, she realized that she could be a superhero writer and write about saving the world. Combing her powers, she now writes for various eco and travel sites across the web, changing the world one article at a time. Feel like chatting? E-mail her b.shereshewsky@yahoo.com.

I found an incredibly simple recipe for pickling peppers on the blog Blue Willow Journal. The recipe calls for only three ingredients plus a canning jar.

The new health and beauty lifestyle brand, Intelligent Nutrients, was recently unveiled to the press and beauty industry and includes more than twenty SKUs for launch which is expected this fall. The launch collection includes certified organic aromatics, certified organic scalp and hair care, certified organic hair styling, certified organic total body cleanser, certified organic lip delivery nutrition, and the heart of the line, Intellimune an internal/external certified organic super antioxidant seed oil blend and tablets.<query> who is the founder of aveda</query> When Rechelbacher sold Aveda to Estee Lauder ten years ago a non-compete agreement prevented him from starting a new personal products line at Intelligent Nutrients until this year. We were able to catch up with Rechelbacher at LOHAS in June where he said the standards for health and body care products are not strict enough, with most classifications allowing percentages of petrochemicals and other toxic elements to be used in varying amounts. The entire health care industry is reliant upon petroleum products and he believes that the only true organic classification is in the food category, what we know as Certified Organic. Rechelbacher emphasizes that we shouldn’t use anything on our skin that we couldn’t eat. Thus, another level of purity and health being introduced to beauty products using food grade organics will be what makes Intelligent Nutrients unique. His belief is that beauty follows health.<query> who owns aveda</query> Inspired by Bibi Rogers and her creative line of ‘I ReUse’ plastic bag holders, I asked some people I knew why they reused. “I started reusing because it made more economical sense, now, I reuse because I have absolutely no reason not to,” says Catherine DelSpina, Marketing Optometrist, who is working withNextLife, a plastic waste recycling company that repurposes plastic into new products. “I reuse because it’s easier than buying new,” says Annette Caballero, a New York resident and green company assistant. “I reuse because I know that it is something that I can do that will affect the Earth in the long run,” says Alex Maughan, a bike mechanic out of Boulder, Colorado. “It’s a philosophy through action and it might encourage others as well.” Every year, over 500 billion plastic bags are manufactured world-wide.<query> why do people reuse plastic</query> “The organic industry is just in its infancy but is in danger of getting polluted fast through our environmental mismanagement of natural resources and business exploitation by green-washing marketers,"" said Rechelbacher. In addition to launching the Intelligent Nutrients line of products, the company is also launching concepts stores, as stand alone storefronts and within larger premium retailers, spas and salons starting this fall internationally. A very ambitious launch strategy is being planned that includes stores in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and others right out the gate. Intelligent Nutrients is a personal philanthropic project for Rechelbacher, while the company itself is a for-profit entity, the majority of the income after taxes will be going to social and environmental projects, especially women’s groups because in his belief, women are the educators. When asked what the goal is for Intelligent Nutrients, Rechelbacher laughs and says, “My goal is to be bigger than Aveda."" He was able to raise the bar for health and beauty products years ago when he launched Aveda, now Horst Rechelbacher is doing it again by challenging the entire industry and taking organic products to the next level with Intelligent Nutrients This is the first phase of an entire lifestyle brand with future products to include skin care, body care, maternal/baby care, love therapy, pet care and INvironmental products for the home.<query> what is intelligent nutrients</query> Anke Corbin recently left her corporate career as VP marketing for a major media company in order to launch an eco-marketing consulting agency and to design her first environmentally responsible indoor-outdoor furniture collection called Anke C.- Real Living launching spring 2008.

Posted by Rider Thompson on July 29, 2008 | Email this post | Comments (1) July 24, 2008 Oggi Water Bottles: More Like a Wonder Bottle than a Water Bottle I live in a state where a relaxing weekend requires one or more of the following: hiking boots, an ice axe, a climbing harness, a mountain bike and a kayak. A romantic date is best spent holding hands at 14,000 feet and instead of high heels, ladies wear Chocos.<query> when does smarty dish come back</query> I live in a state where Prada means nothing and PrAna creates real brand envy. I live in a state where water bottles are an accessory, not a sports aide. As of late, water bottles have been getting a lot of bad press. From the impact plastic bottles make on our landfills to the dangers of Bisphenol A, things are looking a little scary when it comes to the big blue. A safer alternative to the once universal Nalgene bottle, aluminum bottles are the new ‘it’ thing. When it comes to choosing an aluminum bottle, we consumers have a few choices. I found OGGI Bottles. They are part of a travel line and right up my alley. Pricing out at $9.95, there are enough colors to match my moods, and my outfits. With a screw top and carabineer clip, these bottles are the go anywhere, stand up to anything, keep your drinks cold and your water close at hand kind of bottles that someone like me needs.<query> what is the best water bottle to use</query> So, I put it to the test. 230 feet up on a rock shelf in Southern Colorado and it passed, with ruby red and blueberry blue colors! Clipped to my harness, exposed to full sun, I was surprised to find my water cold and tasty. This bottle is one tough cookie. Drop it, drag it, throw it, catch it, no matter what you do, one thing is for sure, the water inside, stays inside, and landfills aren’t getting any bigger. It’s time to retire the plastic water bottle along with the plastic bag. Reusable is in, and when it comes to OGGI water bottles, it is stylish.

So why haven’t we thought about reusing them before? Granted, in recent years, reusing plastic bags has gained some celebrity, but, generally speaking, I think most of us fall into the category of, ‘I would, if I had them on hand.’ Meet Bibi Rogers. Originally from Barcelona, Spain, Bibi is not your typical greenie. A kite-surfing, kayaking green-love advocate, her outlook changed when she saw a plastic bag floating in the river. “In life, I like to lead by example and after seeing that bag I decided, I’m going to reuse my bags. The only problem was, every time I kept forgetting them, so I came up with this design.” Shaped like the world renowned recycling sign, this bag helps eliminate those, ‘Ah, I forgot my bags’ moments.<query> who is bibi rogers</query> Small enough for your purse or bag, and large enough to keep track of it (mine hangs in my car), this little bag can pack em’ in. Made from 100% organic fabrics, even the straps and Velcro are recycled! “I decided, if I am going to do it, I have to give back, so I started using vintage fabrics and then I found organic fabrics. The purpose is to reuse what you have. Every time you reuse, you raise awareness in some way,” says Bibi. “I want people to see that sustainable doesn’t have to be sloppy, it can be trendy too!” And trendy they are. For Bibi’s plastic bag holders, it’s all about colors and patterns! And, reaching out to the pooch community, Bibi’s doggy bag sacks can now be found in puppy boutiques across Florida and online.<query> what is bibi bag</query> For the green at heart or the economically conscious shopper in us all, we can all find a reason to reuse. So, for something new, I am asking a follow-up question, I want to ask you, the readers, a question. In your house, what items do you most commonly reuse, and, if there is an item that you don’t reuse but wish you could, what item is that?

Posted by Rider Thompson on August 29, 2008 in Home & Garden , Kitchen | Email this post | Comments (43) August 26, 2008 Fagor Portable Induction Cooktop Fagor, a Spanish company known for high quality kitchen products has introduced a new product available in the US market that offers energy efficient top quality cooking.<query> when did proforce towels come back</query> Fagor's Portable Induction Cooktop offers consumers a fantastic single burner induction cook unit perfect for the home or apartment. The unit is ideal for apartment dwellers who have limited space and/or older inefficient stoves which they can't change. The Fagor Portable Induction Cooktop brings the power and efficiency of induction cooking into the home. The unit is completely portable easy to take outside when grilling or use on the countertop inside. We've had the opportunity to test out this new unit from Fagor and we love it! The induction cooktop is perfect for sauteing. It heats up a steel or cast iron pan quickly and provides a consistent perfectly balanced heat. It has six different heat settings spanning from 190 - 430 degrees. Unlike electric ranges which is what several of our writers have in their apartments, the Fagor Portable Induction Cooktop heats quickly and evenly and reaches the desired heat level quickly. This is where the Fagor shines in terms of energy efficiency. Heat is transferred to the pan quickly and the result is a pan ready for use in much less time than on an electric range. Also the unit allows for precise control over temperatures which is often difficult on a gas stove.<query> what is the best induction cooktop</query> We used the Fagor for sauteing, making breakfast, and boiling pasta water among other common cooking tasks. Each time we used the unit we were pleased with how easy it was to use and how nice it was to have fast even heat. Induction cooktops work with steel and cast iron cookware including enameled. The cooking occurs using an series of induction coils inside the unit these coils generate magnetic fields that induct a warming reaction in steel and iron-based pots and pans. Fagor says their cooktop is efficient because 90% of the heat generated is transferred to and used by the pan. They say the unit is also about 50% faster than cooking on gas or electric. The unit is easy to clean and has a number of features making it incredibly safe. If you are frustrated with your current electric or gas stove or are just looking for the flexibility of an extra burner to use outside or on the countertop the Fagor Portable Induction Cooktop is definitely worth a look.

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree. I would like to take flying lessons but as I am stationed in England (not to mention my newborn baby), it's seemingly impossible right now.<query> what is the scope of a plane</query> Well that's enough about me. Basically I just have these few questions: 1. What education level is required, or preferred, to fly the ""big iron""? 2. Do most pilots start out flying small props to gain flying hours, or do some airlines offer a training program to start you out on jetliners? 3. As I am 27 now, does that somewhat hamper me because of my late start? 4. Do you have just any general tips for me to follow to achieve my newfound dream of becoming and airline pilot? Nash Hi Nash, 1. To be a pilot, a degree is preferable but not an absolute requirement. It depends on the Airlines. The Cadet Pilot or Airline Sponsorship Program is very competitive and usually the cream is selected.<query> what is the education level to become an airline pilot</query> For instance, in one recent advert for sponsorship in UK (they have stopped this program today), there were 40,000 applications for the 100 positions available. However, not all is lost if you do not meet the stringent entry requirements. In your case, are you able to change your trade to become an Air Force pilot to gain some flying experience? Most flying jobs in the military would require a college degree although there are a few exceptions. Your military flying hours are usually recognized in civil aviation. Once you have accumulated sufficient flying hours in the Air Force, enroll yourself into a Commercial Pilot's License course first. When your term with the Air Force expires, you would most likely be ready to seek employment in the civil sector as a co pilot in a multiengine transport airplane. You will have to work your way from the bottom of the ladder but you will not regret for you will learn a lot on the right hand seat.<query> how to become an air force pilot</query> Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License. Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer it take. jawed nasim , 14 Jun, 2010 +0 is becoming a pilot a big problem...? not at all....!!! hi friends, now its very easy to become pilot.. become a pilot with 200 hrs flying exp.

I am currently in the U.S. Air Force and I have been a Crew Chief for 8 years now. I never had much of an interest in airplanes until I began working on them. I probably have more knowledge of flying today (on airport operations, navigation, etc.). I use my Microsoft Flight Simulator to learn a lot about navigation, and also by using my full set of flying charts and aircraft instruments. I currently have only a high school education, but I am about 3 classes away from my associates degree.<query> what is the best route to become an airline pilot</query> thanks David , 05 Dec, 2011 +0 what to do if I want to be a pilot in Indian Air force?

Most major airlines are unlikely to recruit pilots without any flying experiences. 2. A good number of pilots start off from the airline's cadet pilot or sponsorship program where they are trained in CAA or FAA approved Colleges or Flying Training Schools. They commence flying with the small single engine props, and when they graduate, they are given further training by the airlines on the jetliners. 3. You may be a bit late to join the airline cadet or sponsorship program at 27 years (most prefer younger candidates) but some airlines may have different age limit for entry into these schemes (getting very rare today). 4. Alternatively, join a Flying Club and get your Private Pilot's License.<query> how old do you have to be to be a pilot</query> Gradually, build up your experience to become an Assistant Flying Instructor or get a Certified Flight Instructor Certificate. From there, work your way towards a Commercial Pilot License/Certificate with an Instrument and Multiengine Rating before you would be marketable as an pilot with any airlines. If you work hard enough , you will achieve your dream, though it may take a little longer. All the best to your dreams !

The second thing to do is to take a trial lesson to see if you really like that environment and you feel comfortable doing this as a career, i.e. you if you want to become a pilot. Of course if you are young, then talking to the family will help, and getting their support will be important for your flying career. Also, try to learn as much as much as possible about flying and aircrafts. Learning to fly is an expensive business unless you are luck enough to be chosen for the air force to be trained as a military pilot or get selected for one of the very few airline sponsorship programs.

clueweb12-1904wb-28-08556,28,1,"Just as this ageism culture that is being brought in by certain countries breaking Article 33 of the Chicago Convention. What's happening is that countries are letting national pride get in the way of safety. If you don't have enough people to handle safety oversight say so. I'm sure the more well off countries would be able to help. There are several countries that hire in outside help from the UK CAA and I'm sure there are plenty that use the FAA, Transport Canada, CAA Australia and New Zealand. The idea that if you cannot oversee aging aircraft is to ban them even when they are operating under EASA registrations is ludicrous. If you can't oversee a 25 year old aircraft can you really say you can oversee a 14 year old aircraft. Problem is governments get up on their High ""its the former colonial master fault"" Horse.<query> who can oversee an aging aircraft</query> There is no shame in not having enough qualified personnel so accept that and look for other solutions. Nigeria has a 20 year exclusion rule for any aircraft even if its EU, USA but it can be waived for a ""Presidential Decree"". India has a 15 year rule. Article 33 of the Chicago Convention states that: Recognition of certificates and licenses Certificates of airworthiness and certificates of competency and licenses issued or rendered valid by the contracting State in which the aircraft is registered, shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting States, provided that the requirements under which such certificates or licenses were issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the minimum standards which may be established from time to time pursuant to this Convention. It probably does the same for Article 38 and 55. Article 38 Departure from International Standards and Procedures Any State which finds it impracticable to comply in all respects with any such international standard or procedure, or to bring its own regulations or practices into full accord with any international standard or procedure after amendment of the latter, or which deems it necessary to adopt regulations or practices differing in any particular respect from those established by an international standard, shall give immediate notification to the International Civil Aviation Organization of the differences between its own practice and that established by the international standard.<query> what is the article 33 of the chicago convention</query> In the case of amendments to international standards, any State which does not make the appropriate amendments to its own regulations or practices shall give notice to the Council within sixty days of the adoption of the amendment to the international standard, or indicate the action which it proposes to take. In any such case, the Council shall make immediate notification to all other states of the difference which exists between one or more features of an international standard and the corresponding national practice of that State. Article 55 (e) Investigate, at the request of any contracting State, any situation which may appear to present avoidable obstacles to the development of international air navigation; and, after such investigation, issue such reports as may appear to it desirable. All ICAO countries signed up for this convention so why keep breaking the rules.<query> how long does it take to amend an international standard</query> Did you know that if India's idea of 14 years old maximum was implemented in EASA Land the 90% of European carriers would be wiped out overnight.

When the EU blacklist came out, the African Airlines Association was up in arms. Nick Fadugba,AFRAA Secretary General described the ban as “undermining international confidence in African aviation “ making European carriers the “ultimate beneficiaries” who will dominate the African skies to the disadvantage of African carriers! With 111 carriers from 13 African countries banned, the list does indeed undermine African aviation; travellers will obviously consider flying major carriers like KLM/AF or Lufthansa at the expense of the ‘unsafe’ African carriers!<query> which airlines are safe in africa</query> The list was particularly ruthless with African airlines. So what criteria did the EU use to issue its unilateral verdict? It crystallises into 3 major points: Use of poorly maintained, obsolete aircraft(Criteria used to ban most African airlines with old soviet era fleet) Inability of airlines to rectify shortcomings identified during inspections by EU Air Safety Committee. Inability of a civil aviation authority responsible for overseeing an airline to perform its task properly(Criteria was used to ban all airlines from Sudan, Iran) African airlines face safety challenges due to poor infrastructure; lack of capacity, poor oversight and policies and unhealthy finances that impede rapid fleet modernization. Also, according to David Learmount, Flight International Operations and Safety Editor, African airlines do not have the “luxury of a safety culture“ since less developed countries tend to have less emphasis on a strong safety culture in the airline operations!Africa aviation is often associated with the ""Flying Coffins"",old Soviet era Antonov aircraft with notorious safety records!<query> why did the eu issue its unilateral verdict</query> An Antonov 225 In spite of the challenges, several African airlines have earned IATA’s IOSA Certification, a global standard for airline safety management. We have compiled a list of top 10 safest African airlines based on whether the airline is IOSA or ISAGO Certified(As IATA CEO Giovanni Bisignani once advised African aviation stakeholders, “being in the IOSA is a strong argument that you have met the highest standards in safety”); number of serious incidents or accidents since 2000,no of deaths for every a hundred thousand departures.

Not a criticism - IOSA is an important tool - but a valid observation. LOSA on the other hand looks directly at the way aircraft are operated by the line crews and is far more likely to promote continuous improvement in safety.

clueweb12-0300wb-55-15764,29,1,"National PKU News: Tips for Disney World and Disneyland Tips for Disney World and Disneyland Cambrooke Foods has been working in accordance with Disney’s Culinary Development & Special Dietary Needs Team in an effort to make low protein foods available to all of Disney’s PKU and Allied Disorders guests. The phone number to call to make your dining reservations at Disney’s Table Service restaurants is: 407-939-3463. You need to indicate the special diet requirement as PKU. The Cast Member will document this information on the dining reservation and give you a reservation number and a phone number to contact the location to discuss your needs. Disney currently carries MixQuick and a variety of our low protein pastas. Their list of Cambrooke Foods groceries will increase this month to include the following: MixQuick – for Belgian Sweet Waffles and Disney Character Pancakes Home Style Sliced White Bread – for sandwiches and garlic toast American Cheese Singles – for grilled cheese Macaroni and Cheese Camburgers Penne Pasta Portabella Spinach Ravioli Alfredo Sauce *Please take advantage of Disney’s talented chefs whose ability to create a magnificent low protein culinary experience is unsurpassed.<query> cambrooke food phone number</query> (I think that is the name now), also made two sauces: Cambrooke’s alfredo sauce and a wonderful fresh tomato and basil sauce. We only ran into one snag: they didn't have a great variety of fresh veggies for the main courses. I was looking for some broccoli, carrots, beans whatever, and all they had was celery, mushrooms and onions, fried. At Cinderella's castle the breakfast was fantastic (both high and low phe). The chef made beautiful big fluffy pancakes, of course as Mickey ears, and the fruit was abundant. I just wanted to let you know of our great experience in Disney a few weeks ago. I really didn't plan anything ahead of time, I didn't make reservations until the week we were going. We use to live in Florida and would just go for the day and go home, no fancy restaurants.<query> what kind of food is at cinderella castle</query> So I really didn't think to plan ahead and we usually always find food that my PKU daughter can eat with fries, veggies, fruits and salads. However, I thought it might be fun to have some of her PKU food cooked there and not have to bring her already cooked and frozen pancakes on the plane with us. So I made some last minute phone calls. I first contacted Embassy Suites where we were staying and they have a great cooked to order breakfast. They had no problems with me bringing them the Cambrooke MixQuick and making her some pancakes. So every morning I gave them in a baggie with 1/2 cup MixQuick and they added 1/3 cups water and Nicole had fresh, hot pancakes. Plus they have fruit and cereal. So breakfast was great. For lunch we had reservations and I just called Disney Reservation Center: 407-939-3463.<query> what to bring to disney for breakfast</query> I only made these reservations less than one week away from our trip. Now, the Cinderella lunch was already booked but in Magic Kingdom we got reservations at Crystal Palace, Pooh and Friends lunch. I never talked with anyone but the guy who took all the reservations, I let him know there was a diet restriction and that it was PKU, that is listed on their diet restrictions and he put me on hold and called the restaurants and then let me know they had PKU ingredients. I had no idea what that was but it worked out great. Crystal Palace is a buffet and was wonderful for Nicole and she had lots of fruit, veggies and salad. We told our server about the PKU and the Chef came out to talk to us and later brought her some low protein pasta with a red sauce. Now she really had enough with just the buffet food but she was so excited to get the pasta.<query> what is pku in magic kingdom</query> She said to me, ""Mom, I have never had my pasta at a restaurant before"". She was thrilled and I held back the tears. The next day we had reservations at Rainforest Cafe in Animal Kingdom. Again the chef came out and then brought Nicole pasta with a red sauce and a surprise, a plate of little meat(less) balls. He said Dietary Specialties had sent him a mix and this was the first PKU person since he received that. He said it was a little sticky in the pan so he then put them in his pizza oven. Nicole can be picky with it comes to these things but she liked them okay. I tasted one and thought it was good. They were just little maybe 1/2 inch balls. Maybe these are the hamburgers that people have been talking about recently from D.S.<query> where is the pasta from ds</query> I don't know, but he said they were from a mix. Anyway that was a special treat and she also got a salad. For dinners we just ate at the counter type places and she had many choices with fries, fruit and veggies. It all worked out great. She drank half of her formula with breakfast at the Hotel and the other half when we got to the Hotel (late at night). I was very impressed that these Disney Restaurants are already prepared with Low Protein Pastas in their kitchens, it was great. We just returned from a great trip to Disney! I made reservations ahead of time and told the receptionist that we had dietary issues. She marked the computer with a ""PKU"" note and then I called each place individually and discussed our options. It wasn't much trouble and everything was AWESOME! For the most part, the chefs prepared fresh fruit dishes for her and they all had low-pro pasta and Mix Quick available.<query> what is low protein pasta</query> Our best experience was at Epcot in Norway. They have a Princess lunch there and my daughter was in heaven. Chef Dan took great care of us and there were sooo many princesses there! Disney is the best! We did several character meals including Cinderella's Royal Table. They made PKU food for my daughter for no extra charge at every resturaunt! Just call the WDW-DINE reservation # and tell them you have special dietary needs and they will get all the info. WE went for my daughter's 4th birthday and they even made her a low pro cake! They are awesome! We went to Cinderella's Royal Table, Chef Mickey's (in the Contemporary resort), The Norway castle in Epcot, Park Fair in the Floridian, and several others. They were all just wonderful! We had great dining experiences at Disney World.<query> what is the best dining experience at disney world</query> We made all of the reservations ahead of time -- highly suggested. They book up and then you can also have them note on there that you have a special diet and then you will be connected with someone before you leave on your trip to discuss what you want to have prepared for your child. You can check out their menus online the coordinate something similar to what you will eat. I have phone numbers and contact info somewhere. Will look and let you know. Let me know if you have any other questions. I have become quite the pro with Disney. I LOVE DISNEY! I always say that I go there for my kids, but am really going for me :-) At Disney World, here is what we found for PKU diet success: We had dinner reservations at Chef Mickey's Restaurant at the Contemporary Resort.<query> how to make a pku meal at disney world</query> If my memory serves me right, you can take the monorail there or a shuttle from the Magic Kingdom. It is buffet style food, so there were fruits and salad there for Drew, and baked potatoes. Chef Allen made Drew a Loprofin Penne pasta dish in a vegetable broth. He came out and met with Drew and asked him what he wanted first and with what kind of sauce or broth. Drew likes garlic and butter more than marinara, but I am sure he could have done that too... DW has a lot of Loprofin products on hand and with reservations and being in contact with the dietary needs dept, you can usually get them to make sure they have something for your child at the restaurant you are going to. Lots of characters there (like Chip and Dale, Mickey, Goofy, Pluto maybe others).<query> what kind of food does drew mcgraws eat</query> At Liberty Tree Tavern in the Magic Kingdom, we had dinner there which is served family style. They had family size helpings of corn and rolls and stuff and again they prepared a pasta dish for Drew. They also made him a wonderful fruit and sorbet dessert. This is a great place to celebrate birthdays. They brought Alexis a b-day cake we had pre-ordered for the whole family to eat. They sang to her and had lots of characters there too (like Minnie, Goofy, Pluto, Chip & Dale maybe others). We did the Good Morning Gathering which I think was only if you had the group of at least 8 or something. They made Drew Mix Quick pancakes (the mix we brought, I think) with blueberries and strawberries on top. They had characters here too and did dancing with the characters and also wished my mom and Alexis a happy birthday, acknowledged b-days publicly and sang to them.<query> what to eat at the magic kingdom</query> Donald's Prehistoric Breakfastosauraus is at the Animal Kingdom and is alsofilled with characters. Again, they made Cambrooke Mixquick pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream on top for Drew. They had buffet type food here too; I think they had hashbrowns, pancakes, bacon, muffins, dry cereal, juices, etc. Very PKU-friendly too. We ate at Planet Hollywood at Downtown Disney too. They are not a part of Disney, but we took baking mix and asked them to do a pizza for Drew and they were very accommodating there too. In Epcot World Showcase, they have a McDonalds (not full service with a full menu) but they do have fries) At Epcot near the Living with the Land ride, they have a food court that has lots to choose from -- salads and stuff like that...<query> what disney restaurants have pancakes</query> My PKU child is 17 years old and has been to Disney 5 times. Any full service restaurant in the parks or hotels will accommodate her diet. Usually the chef comes out to speak to her and creates a meal of what she wants. This year was the first year that we asked for real ""low pro"" food, in this case, pasta at the Crystal Palace in Magic Kingdom. She got a beautiful plate of penne made, and supplemented the meal with items from buffet. This was the only meal she ate with us as she was down there with the music department of her high school. We just tagged along to see the performances (her chorus performed in the Magic Kingdom!). All rooms at the Caribbean where we stayed come with refrigerators and since we rent a car, the first stop is to a local supermarket for snacks for everyone.<query> what to eat at crystal palace</query> And again Pop Century Resort had a food court that had pre-made salads, fruit cups, dry cereal, juices, fries, and they were very helpful in preparing what we wanted for Drew in terms of low protein foods too. I think it is very beneficial to go to Disney's website ahead of time and look up by restaurant what type of food they serve there. You can also buy a book on Disney World Dining at the bookstores which is a useful guide to what types of foods are served where, how it rates in terms for how expensive it is, etc. We have had many great experiences with Disney Dining. The best one that we do at least twice every visit is Chef Mickey's Character diner. You have to call ahead and make a reservation and tell them about a dietary issue (PKU).<query> what kind of food is served at disney world</query> They will give you a number to speak directly to the chef about a week ahead of time and he will discuss entree and dessert options. We usually do pasta and ice cream for dessert as well as other fruits and veggies on the buffet. Disney is very accommodating and will order food in advance of your arrival. We did Cindy's breakfast at the castle and my kids had pancakes and fresh fruit. Other restaurants we ate at mostly had low pro pasta served with marinara sauce, then the kids could have veggies and fruit and of course French fries. However, I have heard of other families having more elaborate meals prepared for them, so I guess it just depends on the chef you're dealing with. Just calll WDW-DINE to make your priority seating reservations. At that time, tell them your kids have PKU and it is on their ""list"".<query> what to eat at disney castle</query> The person will give you the number of each restaurant, and it is up to you to contact the chef and tell him what you would like ordered. Just make sure that you confirm the meal plans at least a couple of times before you leave. Some places are better than others about communicating with the staff that will actually be there when you visit. You may talk directly to the chef, and you can actually plan a meal. The best one we experienced this past November was the character meal (Minnie, but not Mickey, and friends) at the Liberty Tree Tavern in Magic Kingdom. Chef Mike, who came to our table saying he was ""expecting"" our daughter, made her a meal that matched ours. The meal is turkey, ham and roast beef, with biscuits, and apple cobbler for dessert.<query> what to eat at magic kingdom</query> Chef Mike made our daughter low phe biscuits, low phe pasta, and a low phe apple cobbler. She said it was the best meal she ever had in a restaurant, and it really made her feel ""special"" (her words). She also told Chef Mike he was even a better cook than Mommy! Other places there do similar things, such as making low phe strawberry shortcake for dessert. They will even make low phe pancakes at the Cinderella and Princess breakfasts. Last update: September 2006 National PKU News: www.pkunews.org E-mail:schuett@pkunews.org<query> what is low phe pasta</query> I have to be honest to say that we have never asked the Caribbean Beach resort to cook special for Meaghan since all restaurants, except one which is open only in the evening, are ""fast food."" However, if you let them know early, I am sure they will try to accommodate you since we have never had any problem in all the times we have been to Disney. Since you will probably be spending all day in the parks anyway, you should call and make reservations now for the restaurants. FYI - the new meal plan that you can add to your room is fantastic! We have traveled by airplane at least once a year with our daughter. We have never had any trouble. I have always carried a note from our physician explaining what PKU was, but have NEVER had to use it.<query> can you eat at disney world</query> Disney World is the best!! Just call the Disney dining number and they will arrange any meal you want in a sit down restaurant. They have low pro foods on hand! They were absolutely wonderful with my daughter's food! They even made a low pro birthday cake! I would suggest that you purchase the Birbaum's guide to Disney World (you can purchase this at the Disney store if you have one). It lists every restaurant at every park and resort. It tells you what they serve and what price range. Make your restaurant selections and then call the dining number. Tell them that you have a child with special dietary needs, they will give you phone numbers for chef's at the individual restaurants and then you can make all your lo pro arrangements from there. One of the best if Chef Alan at Chef Mickey's (in the contemporary hotel - perfect for birthdays!)!<query> what is the best restaurant in disney world</query> We went to several sit down restaurants as well as several counter service restaurants. At the counter service ones we got French fries, fruit or salad. They were all so wonderful. Also, I would highly suggest the dining plan. It turns out to be a GREAT value. We have stayed at the Caribbean Beach Resort, Coronado Springs, and the All-Star Movies Resort. Of the three, I guess I probably like the Caribbean Beach Resort the best, but there really isn't much difference at all in what is offered at Moderate vs. the Value. The differences are that the Moderate have a full-service restaurant somewhere in them and the Value only has walk-ups. And, I think the rooms may be SLIGHTLY larger in the Moderate resorts. We have traveled to Disney many times and have stayed at everything from Pop Century to the Contemporary.<query> what is the difference between moderate and value</query> There is not much different in the resorts except for location and a few other luxury items. A great web page to check out is mouse savers.com; it has many great ideas. Our daughter has PKU and will be going to Disney with us this June and that will be her forth trip to Disney and we will be celebrating her fifth birthday there. I just wanted to let everyone know that the All-Stars Music Resort (a value resort by Disney) has converted some rooms to ""Family Suites"". This is VERY exciting! These suites will now accommodate up to 6 guests (PLUS a child under age 3 in a Pak-n-Play crib) with a queen-sized bed, a sofa bed, and 2 sleeper chairs (unfolds into a bed like a sofa bed, twin sized).<query> what is the family suite at disney world</query> Also included in this suite is a microwave, refrigerator, 2 bathrooms and 2 - 27"" TVs! This is great news for those of us who travel on a budget, but need a little extra room for our larger families and some semblance of cooking/refrigeration facilities! We just returned from Disney World last week. Disney now actually has PKU in their list of ""special diets"" or ""dietary restrictions"". If you are planning to eat at any table service restaurant in Disney, as long as you make your reservations at least 24 hours in advance, the reservationist will select PKU from their list, PKU will be noted on your reservation, and when you are at your dinner, your reservation card has PKU/Speak to Chef noted and the waitress knows to bring the Chef over to discuss. Really, for the most part, depending on when you go to Disney, you'll need to make any table service reservations a least 24 hours in advance, some character dining places even longer, even if you didn't have to note a dietary restriction to even get a table.<query> how far in advance do you have to make a reservation for a table service restaurant at We had three reservations at table service restaurants, two I made before I left home and one I made the day we wanted to eat there. The first reservationist was kind of vague about what would be available (I don't believe she really knew). The second one actually told me that most Disney restaurants now carry Low Protein Pasta and/or MixQuick (Cambrooke Foods) to accommodate PKU’ers. At every restaurant they obtained low protein pasta and were willing to add whatever kind of fruit/veggie we wanted to the plate. At the restaurant where we made our reservations that morning – Alfredo’s at Epcot,! the manager came over and told us he had a couple of hours but searched high and low and found LoProfin Pasta. At Cinderella's Castle the chef came out and said he had Aproten like it was the most natural thing in the world and what did we want on it?<query> what kind of pasta does epcot have</query> It really was a great experience. Chef Randy at the Crystal Palace was also just so wonderful about everything and told us he had the Loprofin Pasta ready, he was just waiting for us. At fast food places they all have carrot sticks and fruit plates and fries and applesauce and salads- plus we had a backpack w/ lo pro snacks just in case. The ice cream stands all have popsicles so it really worked out great. I definitely think that even in the last few years, it is easier than ever for PKU’ers to get low protein products at restaurants in Disney. It really is amazing how they accommodate special needs. When we were in Disney, we had a few reservations as well. It seems most stick to pasta for their main course. Yes the chefs all came to our table too.

First a word from our sponsors... For anyone attending the event that may be lurking here, I renew the plea that Katie has stated in the One Voice thread for someone to try to start a dialog with Lazaris and/or Concept:Synergy about the many questions that are out there (see the One Voice thread for some interesting questions).<query> what is the difference between lazaris and disneyworld</query> Also enclosed was an eight page 8.5"" by 11"" flyer entitled, ""Lazaris Explains Lazaris"" with a subtitle ""The following are excerpts of a tape Lazaris made to answer some of the many questions people have about him"" with photos of a much-younger Jach, implying it's about 10 years old. Has anyone else seen this? I think the alarm has been raised, they've circled the wagons. I'll be interested to see if they let me join this forum. If they don't, they've got people watching this site and the registration process. What a crying shame. Irene IP: Logged Katie Administrator Posts: 3320 Registered: May 2001 posted 07-26-2001 02:41 PM Hi Irene, Thank you very much for sharing that information.<query> how old is lazaris</query> Isn't it interesting how since we first started discussion the possibility of Con:Sin being a cult that they have begun to act more and more demonstrably like one? I mean, what the hell is the big deal? Why all the secrecy and control over information? Does it make any sense at all? I know the party line is that they are protecting Jach and ""Lazaris"", or their privacy or something, but wouldn't you think that A. Jach and Lazaris would be able to protect themselves? B. That they should just come right out and say that this is an exclusive group that you have to jump through hoops to join? or C. That Lazaris could tell them in a flash exactly what any given person's agenda is? Surely the Grand Orb would be more than happy and willing to participate in keeping Con:Sin ""safe""!<query> is con sin a cult</query> One more bit of evidence IMO that there is no such being. Oh, right, I forgot, they claim to provide ""safety"" and ""privacy"" for the posters there too. Now, I ask you, where was all that safety and privacy while Peny was busy thrashing about in the Forum, during her private nastiness orgies behind the scenes, and how private exactly are those ""private readings""? It's just unreal to me the paranoia that exudes from those nutters. One thing I've learned in life is that paranoid people are that way because they themselves are not trustworthy and they fear that everyone else is just like them. And, yes, Irene, you can be quite sure that Con:Sin closely monitors this site and that someone there is charged with responsibility to read every word.<query> why are people paranoid</query> But that puts them between a rock and a hard place, because like you said, if they refuse you membership that is a clear indication that they do read here, but their official word on this site is that it's just a bunch of negative ego bad energy people and not worth the bother. Someone once reported that the employees at Con:Sin are forbidden to read here. (right!) I do have this sneaking suspicion that Jach is kept pretty much in the dark though. We can't have our teddy bear bothered with any disturbing thoughts now, can we, especially now with his personal pit bull in the grave. I remember reading the Closure thread from the Gangsters in which all are instructed to sit quietly and listen, but not respond. (yeah, Gang, people send me all this stuff, so much for your prized privacy!)<query> is con sin a good place to read</query> Anyway, the Gang goes on and on about what a wonderfully loving person Peny was, and how they were all healed by her love, and that she never hurt anyone, people just thought she did! (Give me a break! Wouldn't you call that being MISUNDERSTOOD???????, isn't that by Peny's definition a clear sign of being in MARTYRHOOD???????) Oh, right, no, it's because stupid people can't tell the difference between being hurt and being loved. Well, my point is that you have to wonder if these Gangsters really believe themselves, or if they had shotguns held to their heads while they were writing. Damn that is one bizarre group! Please do let us know how well you fare in being accepted into that very special group!<query> why is peny a gangster</query> I trust they will not find you to be ""inappropriate"". If they do, trust me, they'll never tell you in what way, or who made the judgement call. It's all blamed on ""intuition"" but we never hear whose. I really like it that you are willing to be open about your process with Con:Sin, Irene. It is this kind of disclosure that really helps illustrate the workings and mentality of that group. I do hope you are not too incredibly invested in becoming a Forum member! If you don't, please don't despair, ""private"" Forum information floats across the internet about as freely as McDonald's double-cheesburger wrappers across the freeway.

I think that there's a Con:Sin Board of Directors somewhere and would love to know who's on it. I think that Jach Purcell knows as much as Nixon knew... not fully immersed, but calling the shots. I think we don't know Jach's or Peny's or Michaell's real names(what's with the bullshit mis-spellings... so that they can align themselves closer to Lazarus? I know, it's that numerology thing!). I think it's not about protection of Jach's privacy, it's about non-disclosure of fradulent activities. I don't know of one other Forum where I've had to be scrutinized (I'm not really a BBer... and there are nutters on all the major news BBs!<query> who is jach purcell</query> -- another indication that they're scared now. Frankly, I think the gig is up. Nothing would surprise me about Jach over the next few months. If he doesn't disappear, I bet he'll flee (under advice from Lazaris, of course)... he must have enough money to live the rest of his life in Europe/South America in great comfort. I try not to be so judgemental these days, and to make a point, I didn't even negatively judge Clinton... he so embodies the very best and worst of our age group. And, I'm pro-choice from birth to death and have made so many wrong choices in hindsight. Duh. But, I will keep you all posted. You gave me a thought. I was thinking that they would find out that my ""application"" followed my visit here and would deny me entrance so I couldn't see what was being said on their site.<query> who is jach clinton</query> Duh! If I'm denied entrance to their site for any reason, including one of massive web site melt-down, I'll conclude they have everything to hide. Later...

I know that in my own case, the idea of even MENTALLY questioning Lazaris was frightening. Then I thought it through... If Lazaris is exactly who he claims to be, he should not have any problem questioning ANYTHING he says. If he is the ""forever and a day"" type friend, he would be proud of my questioning him. If, however, he has a problem with me questioning anything relating to him or the organization that he associates himself with, then I am glad to find that out and I will choose to pick other friends.

Well, Feb was a bit rough for for me - I got into an altercation with the Forum Gang. April was tough - it was Forum Storm. By September I was only about 90% sure that Jach was a fraud. I knew that Sept was supposed to be tough, but we could mitigate the damage by following Sparkey's advice. I hadn't listened to the 2000 tape for several months, and I purposely refused to listen again. I wanted to see how September would fare outside of the artificial reality hell known as Concept:Synergy. Well, September was a rather normal month, not great, not terrible. Except it was great because I had learned to face reality without the orb crutch. (Kinda like purposely walking under a ladder to disprove the superstition) I went back and listened to the tape to see if Lazaris had suggested anything useful.<query> what was the toughest month of the year</query> I don't remember what ""they"" suggested, but it was more specific than simply loving oneself and having a positive attitude (which I did). I didn't use any of the techniques, yet the month was smooth. Amazing - must have been residual good karma for all the work I had done with the material - yeah, that's it. I think I posted somewhere else in here awhile back that, to my knowledge, Lazaris never predicted any major event - such as the 1989 Santa Cruz earthquake, the downing of the Berlin Wall, the death of Princess Diana, the death of Peny(?), the demise of Concept:Synergy... They predict that there will be earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific Rim, that there will be violence in the Middle East, there will be some governmental scandal...<query> what did lazaris predict</query> Stuff that no one without exeptional insight could guess Cheers, Ted IP: Logged Craig Member Posts: 698 Registered: Jul 2001 posted 07-27-2001 09:36 PM Hi Ted, You said: I went back and listened to the tape to see if Lazaris had suggested anything useful.

I know this because I first found this site about a week ago and have just about finished reading every thread. Even though I skimmed over some posts that I thought were irrelevant, it took most of my free time over 5 or so days to do this. There is an incredible amount of ""fluff"" in the reading, including fights between parties with differing opinions. To help me with my own process, I have collected what I consider to be the ""juicy"" (i.e. relevant) parts of the threads. Also as part of my process, I am writing down my interpretation and opinions in a summary of the material. Hopefully this may assist others who do not want to invest the time and energy reading through this entire site.<query> how many posts on a forum</query> That would be an instance where they truly might ""throw their spirituality out the window"". For those still in the fold, it might be interesting to journal your thoughts about the energy of each month after it happened. For this to be meaningful, the person must NOT listen to the tapes until after the year is over (to eliminate any self fulfilling influence and to avoid interpreting the events with a biased spin). How accurate were they? You said: I think I posted somewhere else in here awhile back that, to my knowledge, Lazaris never predicted any major event - such as the 1989 Santa Cruz earthquake, the downing of the Berlin Wall, the death of Princess Diana, the death of Peny(?), the demise of Concept:Synergy... They predict that there will be earthquakes somewhere in the Pacific Rim, that there will be violence in the Middle East, there will be some governmental scandal...<query> who never predicted the berlin wall</query> Stuff that no one without exeptional insight could guess Was anyone else at the LA intensive (or was it a weekend?) during the Northridge earthquake? While he certainly gave a timely discussion after it happened (unlike what he choose not to do regarding Peny's and Michaell's deaths), he gave no indication the night before. It would be interesting to see what a historian, journalist, or some other expert that has no vested interest one way or another in Lazaris to review past tapes and comment on their accuracy. The predictions always sounded to me something you might here on psychic hotline (1-900-ORB-VIEW). Hey, any C:S lurkers - feel free to use idea as a new revenue generator!

If I had known that, I would have had my suspicions long before I did. Wouldn't it make sense for ""Lazaris"" to mention, the night before, that they felt the quake's energy culminating ""in your reality"", and offer a meditaion where they ""will join our energy with yours""? OK, maybe they didn't want to panic people. Uh, no, that explanation doesn't work. Otherwise, we should get rid of our smoke detectors lest they cause a panic. And we should stop research on earthquake early warnings. And we should not tell people to batten down the hatches when a hurricane approaches.

Chow, Audrey IP: Logged Craig Member Posts: 698 Registered: Jul 2001 posted 07-31-2001 01:50 PM Hi Audrey, If my memory serves me correctly, the earthquake was at 4-5AM. That would be just 6 or so hours after our Saturday night ""healing"" meditation. Being from the East Coast, I was rattled indeed.<query> when was the earthquake in chow</query> Being close to the top of the hotel only magnified things. For a year or so after, I would wake in the middle of the night whenever a truck went by on a road about a 1/4 mile away from my house as my body could actually feel the vibrations from the truck. I will use the usual initials of PTSD with a twist as it applied to me: Post Tremor Sensitivity Disorder. A warning would have been most appreciated. Knowing that everything was going to be all right would have been most helpful. Not having any experience with earthquakes, I had no means to evaluate how bad this one was while it was happening. I remember thinking how I just might die now. I have only felt that way so strongly one other time in my life (which I described coincidentally in another post today).<query> what is the initials for ptsd</query> Thanks again for the warning, all knowing friend!

Sorry for the diversion... It stuck me this morning that there are many analogies between Disneyworld and the Lazaris material: 1) There is an unquestionable magic in Disneyworld. 2) There is so much put together in one place, some of which is just brilliant. There is a diversity of material. While all of the pieces are available elsewhere, it offers the convenience of not having to search all over for the pieces of the puzzle. 3) The price of admission is high and continues each time you visit. You notice a lot of overpriced merchandise is being sold to go along with the experience. 4) Some people can't stand the place and don't visit again. 5) Some people love the place and can't get enough of it.<query> what is the difference between disney world and lazaris</query> 6) Even as the place expands over the years, it grows tired for many. At that time they start searching for other sources of entertainment, even if it means forgoing the luxury of having the experience spoon-feed to you in one convenient place. For others, the magic remains. 7) The employees are treated and/or act in a cult-like fashion. Behind the scenes, they probably despise the visitors. 8) Sometimes you have to wait in long lines (like the Crystal Ceremony) for a ride on Space Mountain and others. As you examine the experience, you realize how much fluff time there is. 9) You can pay extra money and get a ""special"" tour specially designed to enhance and expedite your experience (""magic time""/personal consultations). I realize analogies only go so far, but they can be fun.<query> how do you get magic time at space mountain</query> Any others come to mind?

Well. First I had to call. Then Rene tole me that I had to e-mail their site with the answers to three questions: 1) Who told me about Lazaris?, 2) What Lazaris materials am I currently working with? and, 3) Why I want to join the forum!

I also became a practicing thinking astrologer, believing it to be a ""trend"" tool at least as accurate as forecasting weather trends. Read Cayce, Seth, others. Did Tarot.

They e-mailed back to say that they didn't have my name on their mailing list and couldn't begin processing my application for membership until they have it. I told them I stopped receiving flyers about a year ago. They then responded by saying that it would take about a week to process my application. Application????!!!!

I ignored tips, because they would be the same either way. (Tips are not included in the Dining Plan, but we normally tip at least 18%; an 18% gratuity is added when you use the Tables in Wonderland program.) While we may not be typical, here are the results: Table-service breakfasts at The Wave and Kona Café $58.48 with Dining Plan (meals not included) $46.78 with Tables in Wonderland Quick-service meals at Sunshine Seasons, ABC Commissary and Cosmic Ray’s: $6.67 with Dining Plan (one beer not included) $54.91 with Tables in Wonderland (no discount) Snacks: two items at Food & Wine Festival’s Australia booth, two bagged snacks from Polynesian gift shop $0 with Dining Plan $16.67 with Tables in Wonderland (no discount) Table-service dinners at The Wave and Tutto Italia $123.21 with Dining Plan (for appetizers, Pellegrino water, wine and espresso not included in plan) $225.38 with Tables in Wonderland Total cost with Dining Plan: $188.36 + $151.96 (cost of plan) =$340.32.<query> how much does tables in wonderland cost</query> Total cost with Tables in Wonderland = $343.74. So it’s roughly a wash. However, these totals include items we only ordered because they were included in the Dining Plan. If we had been using Tables in Wonderland only, we would not have purchased the quick service desserts ($10.82), Mike’s table service desserts ($14.48 with discount) and two of the snacks ($6.92), for a savings of $32.22. If you visit Disney World frequently or plan a long stay, it may be worthwhile to get BOTH the Dining Plan and a Tables in Wonderland card . Tables in Wonderland can be used to get 20% off any items that are not included in the Dining Plan, such as wine and appetizers. In fact, we used both together on our recent trip and saved over $40 with our Tables in Wonderland discount in that two-day period, on extra meals and items not included in the Dining Plan.<query> how much is tables in wonderland dining plan</query> Back to the home page Back to top MouseSavers.com® is not an official site of The Walt Disney Company or of Universal Studios.

I'm frequently asked if Tables in Wonderland is a better deal overall than the Dining Plan, or vice versa. You can read my evaluationbelow. Jump to: Disney's Dining Plan - Pros and Cons The Dining Plan vs. Tables in Wonderland Disney's Dining Plan - Pros and Cons The Dining Plan includes the following (per person, per night): One table service or buffet meal – includes entrée, dessert (at lunch & dinner) or juice (at breakfast), or full buffet, plus non-alcoholic beverage and tax (gratuity not included) One quick service meal – includes entrée, dessert (at lunch & dinner) or juice (at breakfast) plus non-alcoholic beverage, OR combo meal plus non-alcoholic beverage or juice (at breakfast) OR combo meal plus dessert and non-alcoholic beverage (at lunch and dinner) One snack from a wide variety of options The plan has some flexibility, but not a lot.<query> what is the dining plan for disney</query> Here’s the flexible part: you can use two table service meal credits in exchange for one Character meal at Cinderella’s Royal Table, one Signature Dining Experience at a special high-end restaurant, one Disney Dinner Show, one Private Dining (room service) meal or a Pizza Delivery for two people. There are several not-so-flexible aspects to the plan. For any given meal, you get what’s included, with no substitutions. This was a slight problem for us. We really didn’t want two desserts apiece each day (one with our quick service lunch and one with our table service dinner). In fact, Mike typically doesn’t want dessert at all, ever. We ordered desserts at lunch because they were included, ate one bite and threw away the rest. At dinner I would eat half of my dessert and Mike would take one bite of his.<query> can you use table service meal credits for dinner</query> He prefers appetizers, but those aren’t included. You also can’t “carry over” unused portions of a meal credit – for instance, you can’t get the entrée and drink at a quick service restaurant, then get the dessert later at a different restaurant. Again, this presented problems for us, because we are “grazers.” We prefer to eat smaller amounts at multiple times throughout the day. (“Small plates” and tapas style restaurants are our favorites, since we can try a lot of little bites of different things.) A couple of times we got one quick service meal and split it, then got another later and split that. We were still faced with too many desserts, but this strategy worked better for us. Because of these two problems (too many desserts and the difficulty of “grazing” on small portions during the day), the Dining Plan is not great for a lot of people, such as diabetics and those who are trying to follow special diets.<query> can you eat at multiple times during the day</query> Sure, some locations have sugar-free options among their desserts, but that’s still a lot of empty calories. Surely a bowl of soup or a side salad can’t cost Disney any more than an elaborately decorated slice of cake. It’s odd that the Dining Plan includes dessert at both lunch and dinner, given Disney’s recent emphasis on healthier dining options in its theme parks and resorts. Another element to consider is whether the Dining Plan fits your style of eating. We like to eat a hot breakfast at least a few times during a one-week vacation, then graze on light meals during the day, and then have an upscale dining experience with wine and a split appetizer most evenings. The Dining Plan doesn’t necessarily work out well for that. We end up with lots of leftover quick service meal credits and not enough table service credits.<query> what is the disney dining plan</query> Last but not least, consider whether the included beverages will work for you. We like to drink wine with dinner, which isn’t included in the plan. If you like soft drinks, regular bottled water, coffee or tea, great – those are included. If you prefer wine or beer, fancy mineral water, espresso, smoothies, etc., you will end up paying for your beverages. (Occasionally servers counted an espresso as a beverage on our plan, but not usually.) Even with all of its potential problems, it’s not hard to get your money’s worth on the Dining Plan. Below are examples of bills from Tutto Italia and The Wave: Tutto Italia (Epcot) The Wave (Contemporary Resort) Pollo Matone $26 Pork Tenderloin $21.99 Tagliata di Manzo $36 Flank Steak $20.99 Mocha Tiramisu $9 2 desserts @<query> what is the dining plan for epcot</query> $7.99 each Panna Cotta $8.50 2 coffees @ $2.19 each 2 soft drinks @ $3 each Total with tax: $91.06 Total with tax: $67.46 Total those two meals would have cost if paying cash: $158.52. Cost for the Dining Plan for two adults, for two days: $151.96 (will be $155.96 in 2009). So we were ahead even before we got our quick service meals and snacks. Also, we realize we are probably not typical of those who use the Dining Plan. If a quick service lunch and a table service dinner (or a Character breakfast) each day suits your dining pattern, you like dessert and you drink a soft drink or coffee with each meal, you’ll almost certainly come out way ahead with the Dining Plan.<query> how much does a panna cotta cost</query> The other element of the Dining Plan that is hard to evaluate is its impact on your ability to relax. It helps youenjoy your vacation and worry less about the cost. When you know you can order any entrée and any dessert on the menu, that’s just plain – well, fun. One of these days Mike and I will try the Deluxe Dining Plan. We’ve always felt it sounds like too much food and it’s awfully expensive, but it might suit us better because you can eat nothing but table-service meals if you want, and appetizers are included. The Dining Plan vs. Tables in Wonderland (formerly the Disney Dining Experience) Mike and I also belong to Disney’s Tables in Wonderland program, which gives members20% off all food and beverages (including alcohol) at most Walt Disney World table service restaurants as well as a few quick-service restaurants.<query> what is the dining plan at disney world</query> The Tables in Wonderland program is only available to Annual Passholders and Florida residents, and there is an annual fee. We’ve always considered Tables in Wonderland a great deal . We can often get back the $60 annual fee with our very first dinner at one of Disney’s higher-end restaurants. The question is, if you have to choose one or the other (the Dining Plan or Tables in Wonderland), which should it be? Again, “it depends.” If you drink wine with dinner every night, eat primarily table-service meals and enjoy upscale dining, it may be that the Tables in Wonderland program is a better bet for you. Or maybe not. I decided to compare Tables in Wonderland head-to-head with the Dining Plan over a two-day period, during which we bought two table-service breakfasts, two quick-service meals, various snacks and two table-service dinners.<query> what is the dining plan for tables in wonderland</query>"
clueweb12-0309wb-83-27220,29,1,"Thirsty and/or hot? Stop by Ice Station Cool for a chance to get out of the hot Florida sun, and to try soft drinks from the world over for free. It is a great way to cool off and get some refreshments. (This is the ""ice cave"" located near Innoventions West.) If you or your children like animals, visit The Living Seas pavilion. It is the largest saltwater aquarium in the world. You can see dolphins, seals, tons of fish, sharks, and many other sea creatures. Nothing wild here, except the wildlife! As for World Showcase, my best recommendation would be to explore every country. There is so much to take in here. For rides and/or attractions, do not miss the following: El Rio del Tiempo in Mexico, The American Adventure, and any show in the America Gardens Theater.<query> what is the world showcase</query> If you have little mouseketeers, there are KIDCOT FUNSTOPS set up in every country. Here, kids can do all kinds of fun things with Cast Members. At night be sure to see Illuminations: Reflections of Earth laser light and fireworks display. World Showcase is the perfect place to enjoy a theme park without having to face a lot of thrill rides. ------------------------ DISNEY-MGM STUDIOS ------------------------ When you are in the Disney-MGM Studios your best choices are ones without the explosions, scary aliens, or names like ""Catastrophe Canyon."" One of the top attractions offered is Muppet Vision 3-D. It is a hilarious look at Kermit and the gang's attempt at a 3-D movie -- nothing really scary or wild here, although it does tend to get a bit loud. You will find a lot of good, tame attractions in the Studios, many of which appeal in particular to fearful little ones (although grown-ups can enjoy them too).<query> what is the best disney mgm attraction</query> They include Playhouse Disney Live on Stage, featuring Bear in the Big Blue House, Rolie Polie Olie, Stanley and Pooh, and Voyage of the Little Mermaid, a multimedia version of the Disney tale. Next visit Beauty and the Beast, Live on Stage. There is even an arcade and pizza place, Toy Story Pizza Planet Arcade. ----------------------- ANIMAL KINGDOM ----------------------- I visited Animal Kingdom for the first time about six months ago. It has risen to a tie with Epcot as my favorite park, and I have yet to see everything. My descriptions of attractions within this park are going to be very generic, as I do not want to give away the surprises that await you. The first thing you must do upon entering the most amazing creation (in my opinion) that Disney has ever undertaken is visit The Tree of Life.<query> what is the name of the disney park</query> All I will say is make sure your camera is ready to go! After Tree of Life, venture over to Camp Minnie-Mickey Character Greeting Trails. Here you will find Mickey, Minnie, and friends waiting to say hello and take some pictures with guests. Two good shows for everyone to visit are Festival of the Lion King and Pocahontas and her Forest Friends. These are among the most magical shows in the park. Festival of the Lion King is a wonderful spectacle featuring the music of the movie, while Pocahontas is a live animal show about conservation. Even though DinoLand, USA has the rollicking Dinosaur ride and the wild Primeval Whirl, it also hosts several tamer attractions. For kids, there's The Boneyard playground, and even adults can have a good time at Chester and Hester's DinoRama. They can even go for a spin on the Dumbo-like TriceraTop Spin and play several carnival style games.<query> what is the best place to visit in dinoland</query> (I visited DinoRama during my most recent trip and have to admit, at the age of 30, I had fun.) Four absolute musts in Animal Kingdom are: Kilimanjaro Safaris, Wildlife Express Train to Rafiki's Planet Watch, Rafiki's Planet Watch and Maharajah Jungle Trek. Again, so that I do not give too much away, make certain the camera is ready to go. Stop by the petting zoo to see the animals. In the afternoon jam with Mickey and friends in Mickey's Jammin' Jungle Parade. ----------------------- TOP 10 LISTS ----------------------- Here's my list of the top 10 best rides/attractions for wimps: 1) Tree of Life - Animal Kingdom 2) Kilimanjaro Safaris - Animal Kingdom 3) Spaceship Earth - Epcot 4) Tomorrowland Transit Authority - Magic Kingdom 5) Mickey's PhilharMagic - Magic Kingdom 6) Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Maharajah Jungle Trek - Animal Kingdom 8) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 9) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 10) World Showcase - Epcot My suggestions for the best rides/attractions for not-so-bold youngsters: 1) Playhouse Disney Live on Stage - Disney-MGM Studios 2) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Magic Kingdom 3) It's a Small World - Magic Kingdom 4) Mickey's Toontown Fair - Magic Kingdom 5)<query> what is the best ride in animal kingdom</query> The Boneyard - Animal Kingdom 6) The petting zoo in Rafiki's Planet Watch - Animal Kingdom 7) Dumbo the Flying Elephant - Magic Kingdom 8) Cinderella's Golden Carrousel - Magic Kingdom 9) Camp Minnie-Mickey - Animal Kingdom 10) KIDCOT Funstops throughout World Showcase in Epcot I hope that any of you who have been concerned about being a ride ""wimp,"" or about not being able to have fun without riding all the rides, are now feeling a bit more at ease. If an attraction is not mentioned, it does not necessarily mean I consider it a bad choice. This article was based on my opinions of what people like myself (who don't like wild and crazy rides) would feel comfortable about trying while on vacation in Disney World.

I am going to give you park by park recommendations of the rides and attractions I find easygoing for everyone. I may even clear up some confusion about attractions whose names sound scary but really aren't. (For years I shivered at the very idea of going on the Haunted Mansion in the Magic Kingdom.

This is a great ride for everyone as it travels slowly around the perimeter of the park. Riders can ride the train for the whole trip or get off at different stations (Main Street USA, Frontierland, and Mickey's Toontown Fair). In Tomorrowland you will find one of the best rides for older children and adults: Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin.

All in all, no matter if you are a little or big kid, this is a lot of fun. While walking through Tomorrowland, you may notice blue vehicles traveling above the park. Do not be afraid of this ride, which is known as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority (or the TTA to seasoned travelers). I know many of you are thinking, ""What do you mean travel above the park?"" Relax! Once you realize how beautiful the park is from that height, and how nice it is to be seated for 15 minutes, you will love the TTA.<query> what is the tta ride</query> Plus, you can say you went into Space Mountain without ever having to ride it. (The TTA travels through the Space Mountain building for about one minute). If you are lucky enough that the Carousel of Progress is operational during your stay, you must not miss it. A good number of adults may recognize this from the 1964 World's Fair. It is a wonderful look at the progress in our world from the turn of the 20th century to the start of the 21st century. After visiting Tomorrowland, go to Fantasyland, where there are a number of good attractions just for us wimps. Head for It's a Small World, which is a great choice. How can you resist a boat ride featuring singing and dancing dolls and animals? (Editor's Note: You'll have to wait until spring 2005, though --<query> what to do in tomorrowland</query> It's a Small World is closed until then for a rehab!) Then go right across the way to Peter Pan's Flight. The only scary thing about this one is how long you will have to wait without a FASTPASS. This ride takes you on a magical journey over London just like Peter, Wendy, and the children did in the story. One of my favorite rides in the Magic Kingdom also happens to be another great choice for wimps: The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Riders are loaded into Honey Pots for their journey into the Hundred Acre Wood to visit with Pooh and friends. A new and awesome attraction debuted in Fantasyland in the fall of 2003: Mickey's PhilharMagic. This attraction is a 3-D show unlike any you have seen before. Using the largest projection screen in the world and brand new 3-D technology, Disney brings it to life like only they can.<query> what rides are in magic kingdom</query> Enjoy a funny, musical performance with Mickey, Donald, and all the gang. Little children seem to have a mixed reaction to this show, possibly because of the loudness, so use your own judgment. Two of the tamest rides, which are really good choices for younger kids, are Cinderella's Golden Carrousel and Dumbo the Flying Elephant. Most little children love carrousels and choosing their own horse to ride on. And even though Dumbo goes up in the air, riders can control how high they go. Don't neglect Liberty Square while on your tour. Here you will find the aforementioned Haunted Mansion. I promise it isn't really that scary, except perhaps for those who have a fear of the dark. Visit the Hall of Presidents for a calm show which features every president of the United States. Last but not least, wimps should be sure to stay for the Share A Dream Come True parade, Spectromagic parade, and the Wishes fireworks.<query> what is the tamest rides in the world</query> (If someone in your party does not like loud noises, I would advise skipping Wishes.) Share a Dream Come True is one of the most beautiful parades I have seen. ------------------------ EPCOT ------------------------ In Epcot, you come across one of my favorite rides, Spaceship Earth. This attraction is inside the huge gleaming globe that is the symbol of Epcot. You will travel, at a slow pace, through the history of communication. After Spaceship Earth, venture toward The Land pavilion, as this offers some good options for wimps. In this pavilion you will find the gentle boat ride Living with the Land, which offers you a behind the scenes look at agriculture and how Disney and NASA are working together on better ways to grow food. (It may sound boring but it really isn't.) You will also find the entertaining and educational Circle of Life movie starring Timon and Pumbaa from the Lion King.<query> what is the name of the boat ride at epcot</query>"

Tea is the second-most consumed drink in the world, surpassed only by water. An often-surprising fact to tea novices is that all teas (white, green, oolong, black and pu'erh) come from the same plant. The botanical name of this versatile plant is Camellia sinensis. Camellia sinensis is a sub-tropical evergreen plant native to Asia but now grown around the world. The tea plant grows best in loose, deep soil, at high altitudes, and in sub-tropical climates. So, in short, ""tea"" is anything derived from the Camellia sinensis plant.<query> what is tea</query> Anything else, while sometimes called ""tea"", is more accurately referred to as an herbal tea or tisane. Tisanes include chamomile, Rooibos and fruit teas. How is it grown? The tea plant, which grows in the wild in some parts of Asia, is cultivated in a variety of settings from small family gardens to giant estates covering thousands of acres. The best tea is usually grown at elevation, and often, on steep slopes. The terrain requires that these premium teas be hand-plucked. Many of the teas that are grown for tea bags or iced teas, on the other hand, are grown on large, flat, lowland areas to allow for machine harvesting. Teas that are processed in the traditional fashion are called Orthodox teas. Orthodox teas generally contain only the top two tender leaves and an unopened leaf bud, which are plucked carefully by hand.<query> where is tea grown</query> Most Orthodox tea production these days involves a unique combination of age-old methods, such as bamboo trays to allow the leaves to wither on, and modern, innovative machinery, like leaf rollers carefully calibrated to mimic motions originally done by hand. A true art form, the tea leaves are handled by artisans with years (often, generations) of training. The other way of making tea is the Unorthodox method, of which the most common type is CTC (crush-tear-curl). This much faster style of production was specifically created for black tea. For commercial production, large machine harvesters are used to ""mow"" the top of the bushes to get the new leaves, rather than hand-pluck. CTC production uses a leaf shredder that macerates the leaves (crushing, tearing and curling them, hence the name) into fine pieces, then rolls them into little balls.<query> what is the process of making tea</query> These teas will brew very quickly and produce and a bold, powerful cup of tea. CTC is usually used primarily in the tea bag industry, as well as in India to create Masala Chai blends (due to their strength and color). What is in tea? The three primary components of brewed tea (also called the ""liquor"") are: 1. Essential Oils - these provide tea's delicious aromas and flavors. 2. Polyphenols - these provide the ""briskness"" or astringency in the mouth and are the components that also carry most of the health benefits of tea. 3. Caffeine - found naturally in coffee, chocolate, tea and Yerba Mate, caffeine provides tea's natural energy boost. How the leaves are processed will determine their final classification as white, green, oolong, etc.<query> what is the main ingredient in tea</query> Although tea is one of the most enjoyed beverages worldwide, its culture can be very ""local."" For example, most tea drinkers in Darjeeling, India have never had (or even heard of!) a Taiwanese Pouchong. In China, most people do not drink black tea. The centuries-old Japanese tea ceremony uses powdered, rare Matcha tea, which most folks in black tea-loving Sri Lanka have never tasted. Tea is a truly special, uniting thing when you think of how so many tea-drinking cultures developed all on their own. America's own newly found tea culture is unique because we actually enjoy all types of tea.

This high quality, wall-mount bracket is perfect for mounting very large flat panels (LCD / Plasma) to the wall. With two separate mounting plates, vertical extension arms, and a maximum weight capacity of 150kg, this model is suitable for very large, very heavy flat screen displays, up to approx 102"". This new model consists of two mounting plates, which can be wall mounted as far apart as necessary, catering for almost any extra large flatscreen TV.<query> what is the max weight of a flat screen tv</query> Extension Arms are also included, for very large TVs with very large mounting hole patterns.

It has a locking bar which does not need to be put into place until you are totally done with the installation. That means you can hook the TV on at the1 top AND still gain access at the bottom to attach cables before installing the locking bar. Other models can be hard to mount because you need to attach the cables before you lift the plasma up onto the bracket, which can be a lot harder than it sounds! Will it fit my screen? It's pretty easy to work out if this bracket will fit your screen: 1. First just measure your screen: as long as the outside of the screen is more than 530mm high, the bracket will not protrude from the top or bottom.<query> how to mount a plasma tv</query> 2. Check the mounting holes on the back of the screen and measure how far apart they are.

This bracket can accommodate a mounting hole pattern of any width. 3. Find out how much your Plasma / LCD weighs. You should be able to find this information in the user manual that came with your TV. The maximum weight capacity of this bracket is 150kg, so as long as your screen weighs no more than 150kg, this bracket is strong enough to hold it.

It's pretty easy to work out if this bracket will fit your particular screen: 1. First just measure your screen, the bracket is 650mm wide and the arm height is 420mm so as long as the outside of the TV is wider and taller than that, the bracket will not be visible from in front of the TV. 2. Check the mounting holes on the back of the screen and measure how far apart they are. This bracket will fit screens with mounting holes a maximum of 620mm wide and 400mm high (centre of hole to centre of hole). Selby's New & Improved Better Value Bracket This bracket is new to Selby for our 2012 range and features several improvements over most slimline tilt brackets.<query> what size bracket for tv</query> For example, some slimline tilt brackets slowly tilt forwards due to the strain of supporting large TVs, but this bracket features a stronger tilt mechanism which prevents slippage. This bracket also allows you to tilt the screen both downwards AND upwards, which helps with connecting cables. Slimline brackets allow your TV to sit very close to the wall, but that usually makes it very difficult to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV. Being able to tilt the screen upwards can provide you with much easier access to your TV's connections. Designed for Australian Homes This range of brackets is designed to suit the stud spacings of Australian homes. This PLB131L fits perfectly across two 600mm-spaced studs (Australian standard). Slimline Bracket for Thin TVs This is a slimline bracket which sits closer to the wall than most other tilting brackets.<query> what is the tilt bracket for tv</query> It is designed for use with the ultra slim LED screens, but is also suitable for use with LCDs and Plasmas. Please note that some manufacturers recommend that LCDs and plasmas are not to be mounted within a certain distance from the wall, due to heat and ventilation concerns. If unsure, check your user manual or contact the manufacturer. Vertical Tilting Action This bracket offers a +/- 15 degree tilt. Perfect if you wish to mount your TV high on the wall and tilt it down, for example in the bedroom (or in the presence of curious young children with sticky hands!). Downwards tilt can also help to avoid getting annoying reflections on the screen, while upwards tilt makes it much easier to connect the necessary cables to the back of your TV. Features: - Low profile ""slimline"" design - Easily adjustable - +/- 15 degrees vertical tilt - Free 2m HDMI cable (v1.4) - Free clip-on bubble level Free HDMI Cable and Bubble Level<query> what is vertical tilt</query> This bracket includes a free 2 metre v1.4 HDMI cable (High Speed with Ethernet) and a clip-on bubble level / spirit level to assist with accurate installation of the bracket. Specifications: - Vertical Tilt: +/- 15 degrees - Distance from wall: 50mm - Maximum weight capacity: 60kg - Total width of bracket: 650mm - Total height of bracket: 420mm - Maximum mounting hole spacing (horizontal): 620mm - Maximum mounting hole spacing (vertical): 400mm - Suits VESA standards up to 600x400mm Screws and Bolts Included This bracket includes a variety of screws and bolts which are suitable for attaching the bracket to the wall and also attaching the bracket tomost TVs. Some screens require screws other than those which we provide.

It is now OpenSource. Currently I have switched to a very interesting way of programming in WebSphereStudioApplicationDeveloper. The same pattern can be applied to EclipseIde. Here is a description of the method. The idea is to use EclipseIde in tandem withBeanShell. It gives me a very pleasant experience of programming. In the present time I work with web applications, but I think this pattern can be useful for programming inside of any framework or container (as long as web server is a container for servlets, too). To write a new code or to fix something, I set a breakpoint in my code in Eclipse.<query> what is the purpose of the eclipse editor</query> (I don't expect 100% of installs to work seamlessly, but some sort of error message would be nice.) There doesn't seem to be any documentation about what you're supposed to do if it won't launch. Do I really have to start debugging it? -- DafyddRees Dafydd, I also had this problem when I grabbed the latest version of Eclipse. Its because Eclipse doesn't ship with a JRE but the launcher is a win exe that hangs if Eclipse doesn't start (they really should sort that). You can download a 1.3.x runtime from the Eclipse website or use another JDK if you use the appropriate command line arguments. ChanningWalton Problem fixed - I posted the details on the eclipse newsgroup. Within a day, I had the answer: install a more recent version of the Java 2 SDK.<query> what is the launcher for eclipse</query> That fixed the problem. This is a great IDE - it only took a few hours to get productive and I even have enough memory left over do useful things. -- DafyddRees A general way to debug startup errors is to run eclipse from the command line (in the eclipse directory) with java -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher. Main This method reported to me that a certain dll did not have the proper permissions (Windows 2000) -- Mark Miller We use Eclipse for our every-day development. Importing our existing code was no problem (several thousand classes). It works allright, though we had to drop thespectacular integration with CVS (no, it is really great) because of performance problems.(you might want to check a recent build, they've been making improvements :) ) We're quite happy with it, it is usefull and the price is right ;-).<query> how to debug eclipse startup error</query> I hope to see aMacOsx version soon. --AlexVanDenBergh The MacOsx port is available now. --ChanningWalton The only thing I find missing in Eclipse (v2.1) is global regex search and replace, there is only global find (Ctrl-H) but no replace, Find/Replace (Ctrl-F) only works in a single file. It's there, but it's hard to find. Do a global find (Ctrl-H); then, in the search results window, you'll see ""Replace"" in the context menu (right-click). Otherwise, depending on what you are trying to do, one of the refactoring functions which will make the changes in a semantically meaningful way might work for you. Refactor->Rename... 3.0 stream adds regex in replacements (search regex have been available for some time, but the ability to use matches in the replacement is fairly recent).<query> what is regex in eclipse</query> I wonder... Are there any guides to stand-alone application deployment with Eclipse? Last time I was any involved with Java, I reconsidered for JBuilder mainly for its configurable build options, especially packaging all dependencies and resources into a single JAR file. I was doing a GUI assignment, and it took me ages to figure out how to get JFace viewers running outside the Eclipse environment. A stand-alone SWT/JFace/RCP SDK for use with any development environment would be a nice thing to have. Although I don't think there is anything beyond the plugin/feature development stuff built-in, there is an open-source plugin (the name of which escapes me right now) which provides a package-all-dependencies-into-a-giant-jar function. Q. How does one print with line numbers?<query> what is jface jar</query> It seems that one can make line numbers appear on the screen but cannot print out the file with the numbers included. Is this a missing feature or a user error? A. It is a missing feature. See http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19602#c2 Not to be whiny, but WHY are they still putting this feature off? Most of us probably work in environments where we do code reviews, and line numbers are pretty essential, aren't they? Headers and footers would also be nice, and they've been deferred too... AnneM: for java I discovered this; http://www.eclipsenews.com/en_archive/etips_10062004.html To show line numbers in the Java editor, select Window => Preferences, open the Java node, and select Editor. Then, in the Appearance panel to the right, click the Show line numbers check box and then click OK.<query> how to show line numbers in java</query> Unfortunately that solution is language specific, thus not really maintainable. Q. AnneM: I work on a Mac and desire to have my full printing options, ie 2/page duplex. How do I get that? Q. Can you hide directories from being displayed in the left window? I have several data directories, which I never examine with EclipseIde, cluttering things up. A. Yes, you can. In the Java perspective, package explorer window, click the Menu arrow and select ""Filters..."". You can do the same in the Resource perspective's Navigator view. Is there some other view in Eclipse where the folders show up that you'd like them to be hidden? Q. Can you keep your source external or do you need to import it into a project? A. Yes, you can keep it external (since the 3.0 stream).<query> where is the folder in eclipse</query> Q. Can you edit code externally (say with vi) and then recompile in Eclipse? A. Yes, just refresh the directory where you edited the code so that Eclipse knows that it has changed. The latest versions can detect changes automatically, although I'm not sure it will trigger a rebuild.

Maybe it will be just a stub that has empty methods and will really do nothing. BeanShell JAR should be added to the project classpath. Then I run my application in Eclipse debugger and press all the necessary buttons in my GUI. When debugger stops on my breakpoint, my context is properly initialized. All objects (like HttpRequest?) had proper values, etc. Next, Eclipse has a debug window named Display where you can execute code. Generally I add to the application to the ""test"" package a little class named ""Beanshell"". I run it from the Display window in the following way: new test. Beanshell(new Object[] {someInterestingObjectCurrentlyAvailable, anotherInterestingObject, ...}, ""myscript.bsh"") This class just calls BeanShell script named ""myscript.bsh"".<query> how to add beanshell to eclipse</query> First argument is available to script as ""params"" array. Here the programming itself starts. Sitting on that breakpoint, I modify ""myscript.bsh"" and run it as many times as I like till it will do the job. Good news aboutBeanShell is that you have not recompile anything, your changes are available to system immediately, so your development cycle between the change and seeing it's result is minimal. All exceptions are catched inside Beanshell class. This way you can create a BeanShell code that will implement your feature. Converting it to Java code is easy At its core, out of the box: Strong refactoring support Variables and Classes up and down their respective hierarchies (local to field, anonymous to local, local to top-level) Renaming of anything, with or without updating references, javadoc and string literals (useful for reflection) Extracting methods (passes RefactoringBenchmarksForExtractMethod) Extract Interface Option previews for all refactorings Did I mention code completions?<query> what is beanshell</query> Context sensitive method, class and variables suggestions (i.e., will only show methods returning List subclasses if in a assignment to a List variable) Variable guessing for all completions Editable templates, with access to variable guessing Create method, variable or class Useful support for anonymous and nested classes. Support for Junit Formatting Remappable key bindings Ant builds, as well as builtin incremental builds. Complete cvs integration, and there are several third party plugins supporting other versioning systems Lots more built in, and anything that isn't built in can be created as a plugin (i.e., realtime code metric analysers that give notice through the same mechanisms as the built-in plugins, alternate editors, compilers, Gui designers, round-trip graphical models, alternate code completers, etc...) And then there's the Eclipse Platform on which the Ide runs...<query> what is jimit cvs</query> The Eclipse Platform is an open framework and toolkit for building IDE's (just likeMozillaBrowser isn't a web browser but a web platform). Eclipse itself consists of a set of core technologies (a windowing API that works the same on Linux and Windows and a few other useful bits and pieces) a core Java Development Toolkit, and what is called the Plugin Development Kit. You can build ""plugins"" in either Java or other technologies (integration with ActiveX and COM is included) which can interact with each other through standard, publishedExtensionPoints. It is the foundation for IBM's new commercial IDE, known asWebSphereStudioApplicationDeveloper. Eclipse is open source under the CommonPublicLicense version 0.5 (as of November 8, 2001). The Eclipse IDE supports several languages. language plugins: Java -- comes with Eclipse C/C++ http://eclipse.org/tools/ PythonPluginForEclipse: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyeclipse/ As of today (13th Aug. 2002), it's only version 0.0.1, but already good enough to edit with syntax highlighting and to run your programs.<query> what is the eclipse platform</query> COBOL IDE for Eclipse http://eclipse.org/tools/ Ruby Development Toots http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/ Perl - using the EPIC plugin http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/ I've been playing around with the C/C++ IDE a bit over the holidays and it's a reasonable front-end to GNU C++. Even though they say it's only officially for Linux, I've been using it on Windows 2000 with only a few problems. I've been using MINGWIN32 for my GNU tools suite to sit beneath Eclipse. About the only thing I've not been able to do yet is to write a DLL for integration with Java (my whole reason for doing this) but that's mostly due to my inexperience with GNU C++. With a bit more work this will be fully as capable as Visual C++ and a lot cheaper :) --KyleBrown May be a stupid question: is there a smalltalk plugin for eclipse?<query> what is the c++ ide for eclipse</query> I don't think the question is stupid, as there are plugins for a whole number of languages, but the answer seems to be ""no"" at the moment. At OOPSLA this year, there was a presentation on Eclipse. There, some guys (from IBM, I believe) gave a short demo of their eclipse-smalltalk work. It wasn't prime time, but they demonstrated that they were able to write and run a tiny smalltalk program using eclipse. The downside is that they were using a proprietary smalltalk component instead of an open one, likeSqueakSmalltalk. -- EricHerman Which year? OOPSLA 2005? -- omc other plugins: LunarEclipse ""Editor Enhancements"" - http://lunar-eclipse.sourceforge.net/ AutomatedContinuousTesting for JUnit tests VE: the Eclipse Visual Editor: a framework for creating GUI builders for Eclipse. Is this MetaProgramming or what ?<query> what year was eclipse presented</query> Recommended plugin... LunarEclipse ""Editor Enhancements"", and install the Emacs plugin... I only use the completion command from it, but it adds a lot to eclipse. Don't get me wrong, the code completion built into eclipse isgreat, they really serve different purposes, the built in one is more 'global', more 'smart', the emacs one is quicker, and you tend to have many happy accidents (it searchs for all matches, in all open editors, and including matches starting partway through a word) -- WilliamUnderwood I was all excited to see ""emacs"" and ""eclipse"" mentioned on the same page, but alas, the Editor Enhancements package does not seem to provide an emacs keybindings remapping to eclipse... I'd love to dive in, but my fingers keep getting lost along the way.<query> what plugin to use for eclipse</query> They're too trained to emacs shortcuts. Emacs keybindings are in Window -> Preferences -> Workbench -> Keys -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Active Configuration -> Emacs. The core philosophy behind Eclipse is ""Everything is a plugin,"" as inspired byVisualStudio. it is an open framework and toolkit for building IDE's It don't think it's only useful for building IDEs. You can take out all IDE-ish parts, as they're only plugins, and have a complete application framework for complex tasks. The extension point strategy is very concise and expressive. I had my first plugin running in minutes. --ManuelSimoni I saw this running at LondonXpDay. I liked it so much I tried to install it at home. (Normally I'm immune to the tool hype.) I tried to install it under Windows98 - all I got was a splash screen that seemed to hang.<query> what is the core philosophy of eclipse</query>"
clueweb12-1008wb-39-04736,39,1,"Process XML in Java more easily by... not using Java? ➜ Paul Dowman Paul Dowman Ruby/Rails consulting: development, deployment, performance & scalability, devops Home Projects Reading Process XML in Java more easily by... not using Java? January 22, 2007 Java and XML are like peanut butter and chocolate, right? They just go together, don't they? Jon Bosak of Sun summed it up most famously as ""XML gives Java something to do"". XML gives Java developers something to do I think I see Sun's master plan: the more work Java developers must do to solve a given problem, the more of them we'll need to have. The more Java developers we have, the morepopular Java appears. (The only problem left to solve is how to profit from that, but I digress).<query> why is xml used in java</query> The key to this plan's success is lack ofsyntactic support for XML, and the added bonus is that even more developers will occupy their time building endless numbers of libraries! ""Why make trillions when we can make... BILLIONS?!"":-) There are some decent libraries for handling XML in Java, but most are quite heavyweight, requiring you to create Java classes (in the case of the XML binding variety) or at least a config file (XML-based, naturally!). There is another way I've written before about using other languages with Java, andGroovy has some really nice features for handling XML. Groovy compiles to Java bytecode so you can write an XML handling class in Groovy and use it within your Java app. Here's an example that uses Groovy's GPath to read in an XML file from Sun's XML DOM tutorial, and prints some of the elements.<query> what is groovy xml</query> Just for fun, we're loading the XML file directly by http: def slideShow = new XmlSlurper().parse(""http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxp/dist/1.1/docs/tutorial/dom/samples/slideSample01.xml"") println(""slideshow author attribute: ${slideShow['@author']}"") def slides = slideShow.slide for (slide in slides) { println(""slide title element: "" + slide.title) for (item in slide.item) { println("" item text: ${item}"") } } Here's the Java version as a comparison. Honestly, nobody really uses the DOM API because it's so painful (hence the existence of so many libraries to do the job), but this is the out-of-the-box Java way: DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); URL url = new URL(""http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxp/dist/1.1/docs/tutorial/dom/samples/slideSample01.xml""); InputStream stream = url.openStream(); DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder(); Document document = builder.parse(stream); Element rootElement = document.getDocumentElement(); String author = rootElement.getAttribute(""author""); System.out.println(""slideshow author attribute: "" + author); NodeList slides = rootElement.getChildNodes(); for (int i = 0; i < slides.getLength();<query> how to load xml files in java</query> i++) { if (slides.item(i).getNodeType() == Node. ELEMENT_NODE) { Node slide = slides.item(i); NodeList slideChildren = slide.getChildNodes(); for (int j = 0; j < slideChildren.getLength(); j++) { Node child = slideChildren.item(j); if (child.getNodeType() == Node. ELEMENT_NODE) { if (child.getNodeName().equals(""title"")) { System.out.println(""slide title element: "" + child.getTextContent()); } else if (child.getNodeName().equals(""item"")) { System.out.println("" item text: "" + child.getTextContent()); } } } } } I have omitted error handling. Using XPath in Java can make our job easier when it comes to searching a tree for a node (you wouldn't want to see this done with pure DOM manipulation!), but we'll still still have to deal with anorg.w3c.dom.<query> java how to get a node</query> Node object that is the result: XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath (); String expression = ""/slideshow/slide[title = ' Overview']""; Node overview = (Node) xpath.evaluate(expression, document, XPathConstants. NODE); Here's the same thing done in Groovy, a simple one-liner: def overview = slideShow.slide.find { it.title == ""Overview"" } Two interesting things here are the use of a closure, and the use of == which might look wrong to a sharp-eyed Java programmer. Groovy uses == for equality and the method is() to test for identity. This is the opposite of Java but leads to more readable code because typically we compare for equality much more often than identity. And == works with null in Groovy, so your typical Java comparison (x ! = null && x.equals(y)) becomes x<query> what is the difference between groovy and java</query> == y in Groovy, which looks more like what we mean. Creating XML is also easy in Groovy using MarkupBuilder, here is the code to create oursample XML file: def doc = new StreamingMarkupBuilder().bind { slideshow(title:""Sample Slide Show"", date:""Date of publication"", author:""Yours Truly"") { slide(type:""all"") { title(""Wake up to WonderWidgets!"") } slide(type:""all"") { title(""Overview"") item(""item"") { mkp.yield(""Why "") em(""WonderWidgets"") mkp.yield("" are great"") } item() item(""item"") { mkp.yield(""Who "") em(""buys"") mkp.yield("" WonderWidgets"") } } mkp.yield(""normal text here"") } } System.out << doc It's easy to read because it has a visually similar structure to the XML that it's creating, and the syntax is quite terse. Groovy has similar builders for other things besides XML, for example to createSWT and Swing UI's.<query> how to create xml in groovy</query> You can evencreate your own. More on how this is implemented coming soon... There are other choices besides Groovy, of course, I haven't tried it yet butScala looks like it might be a good choice.

That effort introduced the Start button, Taskbar, and other now standard icons. Windows 8 goes even further. Users will have the option to ditch the long familiar Explorer interface and work in Metro mode, which effectively turns a PC into a tablet or big smartphone. There are lots of other big changes in store--here's a look at some of the more significant ones that Microsoft has confirmed to date.<query> what is windows 8</query> More Windows Insights White Papers Creating the Enterprise-Class Tablet Environment - by Yankee Group Red Alert: Why Tablet Security Matters - by BlackBerry More >> Reports Research: Windows 8 5 Ways to Clean Up the OS Mess More >> Webcasts Overcoming Piecemeal PCI Compliance: Integrating Technologies and Processes Maximize ROI with Database Consolidation onto Private Clouds More>> 1. Live Tiles. The most notable change in Windows 8 is the addition ofLive Tiles, the cornerstone of the Metro interface. Borrowed directly from Windows Phone, Live Tiles are blocks of screen real estate that display real-time information, such as the number of new messages, from content sources like social networks, e-mail, and news feeds. Metro was built with touch in mind, and it's an indication of how serious Microsoft is about making Windows 8 as at home on tablets as it is on the desktop.<query> what is the most important feature of windows 8</query> [ How sound is Microsoft's strategy in bringing Windows Phone features to Windows 8? ReadMicrosoft Windows 8 Unification Plan: Grand, But Risky. ] 2. Faster, Prettier Boot Ups. Microsoft knows that Metro and Live Tiles alone won't be enough to make Windows 8 a player in tablets. It needs to be a lot faster than its predecessors when it comes to booting up. Microsoft promises that Windows 8 systems will fully boot in just eight seconds or less. To display more advanced graphics during the boot cycle, Windows 8 relies on new technology called the unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI) for BIOS. UEFI lets Windows work in concert with PC makers' firmware to render visually consistent graphics, such as artwork or vendor logos, through the entire boot cycle. Gone are the DOS characters that appeared during the boot cycle of earlier Windows versions.<query> what is the boot cycle of windows 8</query> 3. Fewer Restarts. Windows 7 gave users a number of options for update notifications and installation. Users could elect to have updates installed automatically or opt for notification when an update was available and choose to be notified only before installation. Those who chose to have updates installed automatically could elect to have the update occur at a predetermined time, or installed as soon as it was available. Most of those options will remain in Windows 8, with one big difference. Users will only be asked to restart their PCs so that an update can take effect once per month--on patch Tuesday. That's usually the second Tuesday of each month. There's one exception--critical security patches will trigger an update request immediately. 4. Secure Boot. In the age of highly organized attacks by hackers and privacy thieves, booting doesn't only need to be fast, it must be secure.<query> what is the difference between windows 8 and windows 7</query> With that in mind, Microsoft developed a boot process called Secure Boot, which is designed to prevent malware from infecting computers during startup, before Windows and all of its built-in security features are launched. Secure Boot works by confirming that all components contain the appropriate security certificates before they are allowed to launch. To meet Microsoft's Windows Certification requirements, PCs and tablets must ship with Secure Boot enabled. It can be turned off by the end user in PCs, but not in tablets.

First of all, Sony should've given the Android 4 ICS preloaded with the device. And secondly, the device should have at least 1GB RAM as its competitors have similar amounts of RAM with almost same or lower price. So according to us, you could buy HTC One X with a just a little more and with quite more features as well as stunning looks.

clueweb12-0309wb-00-05837,43,1,"Now the field of view of the digital camera is exactly the same as the field of view of the film camera. As you can see, under these conditions the resolution from the 10D is clearly lower than the scanned film A second way to look at these images is to say the left and rightmost images represent what you might see if the made equal prints from the 10D and from a 15 x 22 mm cropped section of the 35mm negative (the 10D sensor is 15 x 22 mm). In this case resolution is very similar. The center and rightmost images represent what you might see if you made the same sized print from the 10D and from the full frame 35mm slide. The 10D image needs 1.6x more magnification to get to the same print size and thus resolution suffers But we don't spend our time taking pictures of test targets and looking at the scans under high magnification - well, most of us don't anyway.<query> what is the resolution of a 10d camera</query> I think it is important to say that film and digital will probably always look ""different"", but this isn't necessarily a bad thing - who says that how the world looks as interpreted by the medium of Velvia 50 (around since 1989) is the end-all? What is of more concern to me is that while digital capture has definitely ""left the ground"", it is hardly a mature technology like film, so that in 5 years 11MP capture from a 1Ds may be what ""entry level"" DSLRs will be using (we can only hope :) Any thoughts on how to further approach making this decision would be most appreciated. Joe Ciccone , September 19, 2005; 03:14 P.M. wow..what a lot of noise. First off you have to judge using actual shots of the kind you usually take to see if you think film is better than digital.<query> what is the difference between film and digital camera</query> Now I had a brand new Nikon N75 and 3 inexpensive Nikon lenses. 50mm 1.8 28-80mm 3.3-5.6 G 70-300 4-5.6 G all brand new. I recently bought a D50 Body. I can't explain why BUT the stuff I am getting from the D50 is much much better that the film shots I was getting. Could it be the drugstore processing & scanning? I use the same CVS to make prints from my digital files? Anyway you just can't beat digital for so many reasons.. BUT the main 2 reasons are 1- you can see what you have imedicately and reshoot if necessary. and # 2- you can just keep shooting without fear of spending to much money on wasted shots.... There may be a place for 35mm film cameras, but I think that place might be along side a stack of 45rpm & 78rpm records and some 8 track tapes.<query> why is nikon d50 better than film</query> Ever hear the 'bo-zo's' that claim that the sound from the old records and amplifiers using vacuum tubes is better than solid state equiptment.....sure..sure...if you like scratches I guess? Felix Müller , January 24, 2006; 08:56 P.M. I have to say the 10D shoots are very sharp and detailled, wouldn't have thought. But there are three reasons why I still use a film camera. First: I hate that crop factor. I wish there were more lenses which are adapted to the smaller sensor sizes of digital cameras. Seccond: I don't want to view all my pictures on the computer. I like slide shows but for digital photographs you need a beamer or a really big TV. Both cost a lot of money. Third: For reprints I still need a lab.<query> why do i still use a film camera</query> I could print out my favorit pictures at home but that costs more and the quality is not quite as good as the reprints from a lab. Michael Wang , February 28, 2006; 06:56 P.M. Wow, this thread has lasted more than three years, and the debate of digital vs film is still raging on. For the folks who were converted to digital back in 2003, are you still using the same camera you had back then? Don't you think the best picture you took back in 2003 would look even better if you use today's DSLR? You won't have that problem with film, will you? Gary Lee Grigsby , March 11, 2007; 12:45 A.M. I was 35mm in the sixties and only a fool would argue between DSLR and 35mmSLR. Each has its place and each has very good points for their use. However with CS2 a darkroom has become outdated and quality control is easier then it has ever been.<query> what is the difference between a dslr and a slr Being able to dodge and burn in are things of the past with all of the adjustments that you can do with CS2 and now CS3 is coming. Printers are catching up in quality and having to put your picture where others can see them even 35mm has to do digital. John Sin , August 18, 2007; 12:06 P.M. Do anyone had experienced that to photo the color ""dark purple"" the digital cameras never take it right when seen on printed or on lcd screen, it appears washed out... no matter how you adjust the iso, white balance or shutter/aperture settings.... why? Rene GM , February 22, 2009; 09:19 A.M. I don't understand your conclusion. Your real life image clearly shows that digital 20D is superior, doesn't it? Add a comment Notify me of comments © 1996-2011 NameMedia, Inc. and contributors.<query> what is the best digital camera for dark purple</query> We shoot real objects and look at prints. In the real world, differences you can easily see in scientific tests may not be so obvious. Nor may these differences be as significant as they appear to be from scientific tests. Most real objects don't have detail in the form of high contrast black and white bars with sub-mm spacing. Real Images: It we want to look at real images we have the problem of what to compare with what, but for this test I chose to shoot 35mm film with a 500/4.5L lens on Sensia 100 and scan at 4000dpi with a Canoscan FS4000US scanner, since that's a pretty typical example of what I use. The comparison digital shot was made with an EOS 10D set to ISO 100 and a 300/4L lens at f5.6. I know from previous testing that the 300/4L and 500/4.5L give very similar - and very high - image quality.<query> what is the difference between a digital and a physical image</query> Both are capable of putting over 80 lp/mm on film in the center of the frame. With the ""digital multiplier"" of 1.6x the ""effective focal length"", or more correctly angular coverage, of the 300/4L on the 10D sensor was equivalent to that of a 480mm lens on 35mm film, so I didn't need to change my shooting position much to get the same image as with the 500mm lens. The full frame shot is shown below (it's the digital shot) and the red box shows the area enlarged, Below is the first enlarged image. It's a 100% crop from the scanned film. On my 17"" monitor with a screen resolution of 1280x1024 this would represent a ""real life size"" section from a 40"" x 60"" print. It's approximately a 3.25mm square section on the slide.<query> what is the focal length of a 10d camera</query> Your monitor and screen resolution will give a different scaling factor of course (unless it's a 17"" using 1280x1024). Now here (below) is the same section reproduced to the same scale from the 10D image it had to be upsized by about 200% to match the scale of the 4000 dpi scan since it started out around 2000 x 3000 pixels whereas the 4000 dpi scan started out around 4000 x 6000 pixels. Actual lp/mm resolution is lower, as evidenced by the less smooth diagonal lines, but viewed from a distance it's hard to tell (remember, on my monitor this is equivalent to a 40"" x 60"" print!). Also, the shadow detail is better AND the highlight detail is better, even the color balance is better. Now maybe I could do a more optimized scan (maybe not).<query> what is the resolution of a 10d scan</query> Maybe I could have shot on Velvia rather than Sensia 100 - but I wouldn't normally do that. Maybe my exposure could have been tweaked a little, but this is what I got in real life and represents what I'd be likely to get under typical shooting condiions in the real world. This scan probably took 5-10 minutes including loading the slide, running the preview, running the final scan and tweaking it slightly to try to color correct. The digital image is straight out of the camera, saved as a JPEG (not even as a RAW file) with the default camera parameters and aperture priority autoexposure with multizone metering and aufofocus. I pushed the shutter and this was what was recorded. Again remember that though this image shows ""jaggies"" on some of the diagonal lines, this image represents a section of a print much larger than anyone would attempt to make from a 6MP DSLR file.<query> what is the digital image on a dslr</query> Below is a representation of a 20"" x 30"" print and a 10"" x 15"" print (as displayed onmy 17"" 1280x1024 monitor). These are just approximate sizes of course, but I don't want people to get a false impression of image quality (or lack of it) by looking at greatly enlarged images without realizing just how enlarged they are. 20"" x 30"" 10"" x 15"" Conclusions Based on MY particular film and digital workflow: Even on a 6MP Digital SLR like the EOS 10D, better lenses give better results Digital scans of high resolution film (Kodachrome 25) at 4000dpi on a FS4000US scanner yields higher resolution images than those shot directly with an EOS 10D. Not surprising, but confirmed by experiment. While 10D resolution is somewhat lower than ISO 100 film, it's very little affected by ISO setting so it's quite possible that high ISO digital resolution may be better than scanned high ISO film.<query> what is the resolution of a 10d scan</query> From a practical viewpoint, 10D images printed on an inkjet from digital files are probably equal film up to maybe 11x14. They are certainly good enough to be very hard to distinguish from film. As an aside, if you want the ultimate in sharpness do it the right way. Get a large format camera and shoot film! Of course it's possible that if I shot everything on Velvia and had professional drum scans made of my slides, film would look better than it does when I shoot Sensia 100 and scan on an FS4000US. In fact I'm sure it would. If I regularly made 20x30 prints, maybe drum scanned Velvia would be significantly better than 10D digital images. Again, I'm pretty sure they would. However the point is that Idon't get professional drum scans done, and for most of my work Idon't use Velvia and I don't think I've ever had a 20x30 print made from a 35mm slide, so such comparisons, while valid in the abstract, aren't really valid for me and my workflow.<query> what is the difference between film and velvia</query> I'm just not going to use nothing but Velvia at EI 40, I can't afford to get everything drum scanned and I'm not in the business of making 20x30 prints. So while film may be better in the abstract case, for me it's not. For me I think digital has now replaced film. Not 100% but certainly 90%. I'll still shoot some film, but the first camera I'll reach for is digital and I'll only use film when I think it can do something digital can't or if I really need the higher resolution that scanned fine grain high resolution film can give. Most of the time I think the digital images will be good enough and for most of my applications they won't look much different than optimized film scans. Note I'm not saying ""digital is better than film"" or even ""digital is as good as film"".<query> what is the difference between film and digital</query> I'm just saying that for me, most of the time digital (from an EOS 10D) will likely meet my needs for image quality.

Good job Bob.<query> what is the nikon d4 preview</query> This article has given a sound comparison on ""normal"" scanned image and digital image. I definitely agree that the ""quality"" of digital image has also met my need. But I wonder, how do people evaluate the ""quality"" of an image? I would like to say it is quite subjective to determine the ""quality"" of an image. To me, although the ""jaggies"" on diagonal lines is hard to be seen, I dont like the grainny, and rough feeling appeared in the scanned image, I will say that the general ""quality"" of this image is not as high as that from EOS 10D. I can accept jaggies when the image is magnified or viewed at a resolution higher than 3000x2000 pixels, and I like the smooth and noise-free feeling that I get from the digital image.<query> what is the difference between a digital image and a scanned image</query> This month covers the topic of Depth of Field.

Again, this is very subjective. Just my 2 cents. By the way, if I were to judge whether I will use film or digital to take pictures, will be to consider the usage of the final image.

Oskar Ojala , April 23, 2003; 05:49 A.M. Very good article. It doesn't try to be exhaustive, but takes some common questions and answers them well.<query> what is the difference between film and digital camera</query> The comparison between the digital and film images of the ""real-world"" target was particularly nice, although I'd like to stress that one image doesn't tell everything. Bob obviously has experience shooting with film and with the Eos10D, which matters more when making the comparison than a few images on the net. P.J. Mc Kenna , April 23, 2003; 07:15 A.M. Bob, From looking at some of the 10D images it looks like in-camera sharpening has left a halo around the high-contrast parts of the image - for example the middle picture of the three when comparing film and digital. How much does this artificially boost the 10D images compared to the film-derived images? -P.J. Bruce MacNeil , April 23, 2003; 11:46 A.M. Yes, if you are all willy-nilly over sharpness.<query> what is the difference between digital and film</query> Shoot with 4x5 or 8x10 film... Bob Atkins , April 23, 2003; 11:49 A.M. I'm not sure what an ""artificial"" boost in sharpness is. If it looks sharper, it is sharper, even though resolution isn't affected. Most of us sharpen both digital images and scanned images fot the maximum sharpness that doesn't show artifacts. You can see the artifacts in the images here because you are looking at the individual pixel level. You wouldn't see the artifacts in a print. If you can't see them are they really there? It's a bit like the old ""if a tree falls the the forest...."" question! Actually film also shows ""artificial"" sharpening to some extent too, via adjacency effects, where edges show higher acutance than they really have in the image produced by the lens, due to uneven action of the developer at edges in the image.<query> what is the difference between digital and digital sharpening</query> In fact in B&W work developers may be chosen especially for their adjacency effects in order to increase sharpness. So boosting of sharpness isn't only a digital thing. Ilkka Nissila , April 23, 2003; 12:42 P.M. Note also that digital cameras have built-in enhancement algorithms that reduce the appearance of noise in smooth areas. This can be done using software such as NeatImage for scanned film shots, which should in my opinion be done to the film images before a comparison is made. Bob Atkins , April 23, 2003; 12:55 P.M. Neatimage is great on some shots, not so great on others. However it takes about 2 hrs to process a single 4000dpi scan on my machine (550 MHz) - after I've setup the noise parameters which may take 5-10 minutes. That doesn't exactly speed up my workflow!<query> what software to use to reduce noise</query> Even with a state of the art 3GHz machine it's still going to take 20 minutes or so, or 12 hours for a 36 exp roll of film... There's no argument that you CAN get better results from film, if you pick the right film, scan it optimally, process the scan to reduce noise etc., etc. It's just the amount of time and effort (and expense)that takes is generally not worth the possible marginal quality improvement for the majority of my applications. As I said, if I wanted images I could blow up to 20x30 or more, I'd shoot slow speed film in a 6x9 or large format camera, where the extra effort would really payoff. William Nicholls , April 23, 2003; 03:01 P.M. Scanned 35mm film of the right emulsion may indeed provide more detail, but the examples here show wider color gamut that direct image capture provides.<query> how long does it take to scan a roll of film</query> The color of a film scan is limited by the dyes used in the emulsion, not the color gamut of the scanner. Color detail, even with bayer sensors, is far better on a direct capture from a competent camera than from a film scan. I find a direct capture allows much more excavation of shadow detail than a high dmax scan from a transparency. Although the detail isn't there, the smoothness of tones that you get on a large print from a 6 Mpix capture has a feel akin to a print made from large format film. At 4000 ppi or higher, even a fine grain film is having grain resolved by the scanner. On a big print, the absolute detail is slightly better on my scans from Velvia or Provia, but grain is also obvious. In many cases, I get better 13x19 prints from the 6 Mpix digital camera image.<query> what is the difference between a film scan and a digital scan</query> Yaron Kidron , April 23, 2003; 04:15 P.M. It's hard to compare absolute resolution between film and CCD emulsion, simply because you're doing it on a computer screen, which is CCD-favorable. I've had quite a lot of experience with my S2 Pro in the past year or so, and although digital images contain much detail (i'd say a 6mpixel image would print nicely upto 16x20), most are still easily distinguishable from their film counterparts. CCDs resolve more shadow detail, but do miserably with highlights. There's not even one DSLR out there, regardless of chip size or manufacturer, that can handle highlights well. This is not because of limited latitude- it's because CCDs have yet to incorporate a design that would know how to digest highlights. As for grain, lack of grain is somethimes favorable, sometimes not.<query> what is the difference between film and ccd</query> I often intentionally added noise to my DSLR snaps just because the photo seemed unrealistic to me. Sometimes, lack of grain draws unwanted attention to even-toned surfaces. All in all, IMHO DSLRs work better for portaits than landscape photography. B/W photography is possible with a DSLR, but film would bring out better textures. It's also hard to rely on one channel only, since current Bayer CCD designs leave you with 1/3rd or 1/4th of actual resolving power of the CCD. Digital is another medium to master- quite different than film, and with great potential. I'd like to see more articles as this, Bob. Good work! Bob Atkins , April 23, 2003; 04:58 P.M. <em>since current Bayer CCD designs leave you with 1/3rd or 1/4th of actual resolving power of the CCD</em> <p> I'm not so sure that's realy true.<query> what is better dslr or film</query> For example the 10D has a 7.5 micron pitch pixel array. That's 133 pixels per mm. If we assume the usual Nyquist limit (which may not be valid, but at least should give an upper bound), that would suggest maximum resolution of 67 lp/mm. <p> 1/3 of that would be 22 lp/mm and 1/4 would be 17 lp/mm. The resolution of the 10D sensor is demonstrably better than that. I'd estimate the native resolution of the Bayer interpolated image to be somewhere around maybe 55 lp/mm, depending exactly how you define ""resolved"" and the orientation of the test pattern. <p> I don't know the details of the Bayer interpolation algorithm. It's possible that for pure red and pure blue bars of the right orientation resolution could be less than for black and white bars, but in practice, on real world subjects, Bayer interpolation really doesn't degrade resolution too much.<query> what is the resolution of a bayer interpolated image</query> <p> If you want to use the ""F"" word (Foveon), it doesn't show 3 or 4x the resolution of a same size Bayer sensor. It does show a bit more, just how much more depending on which test you pick. gabriele lopez , April 23, 2003; 05:09 P.M. Very nice article! I agree expecially on the part where you explain that for the most part of uses, digital quality reached the necessary quality we need.. Shoot on something different from a 35mm frame if you need absolute quality.. I think that 35mm film has his strenghts in other hands instead that in those of quality, nowadays... Ciao! Ilkka Nissila , April 23, 2003; 05:17 P.M. Two hours to process an image is a lot. On my one-processor 2.0 GHz Pentium IV, a 4000 dpi scan takes about 7 minutes to process with Neatimage.<query> how long does it take to process a digital image</query> Tweet I often see comments that run along the lines of ""Since digital cameras don't have the resolution of film, you don't get any benefit from premium lenses since the digital sensor limits image quality"". I also see statements to the effect that digital sensors need the very best lenses to give good results. True? Well from a theoretical viewpoint I can make a convincing argument based on convolution of MTF curves that better lenses should give better images even on small sensor, limited pixel count digital SLR camera. But what do real tests show? Well, I took some digital shots using a Canon EOS 10D 6MP DSLR and both a Canon EF 75-300/4-5.6 IS lens (IS off) and a Canon EF 300/4L lens. Both lenses were used at f5.6 and ISO 100 sensitivity was used on the camera.<query> what is the best lens for a digital camera</query> With a dual-processor setup it would be only a few minutes. I think the use of a medium or large format camera to get high quality is not that great an option today. Neither of my favourite colour films (Royal Supra 200, E100GX) is available in large format, and only one of the two is available in 120. I will rather stay with 35 mm until the dust has settled and it becomes clear what exactly is possible with digital sensors. One thing that I'm worried about is the people candid - the exposure latitude of negative film and top-quality analog printing is a quite efficient combination for the people photography that I do. I don't have to stare at histograms, play with laptops and memory cards while shooting 7 rolls of 135-36 during an event. It obviously depends on the lab, but I've struck gold in that department.<query> what is the best camera for people</query> And you can always scan the results and do what you like with the images. I haven't seen any digital printing method that would hold a candle to the 4x6's that I get from C-41 with traditional means. It's kind of frustrating that there is no way that I can reproduce the quality small print without sending out the negs. Why would I want high quality small prints? When a presentation consists of several pictures together, putting them in an album is difficult if they're 11x14's... Yaron Kidron , April 23, 2003; 05:56 P.M. Bob, It's not the apparent lp/m ratio that I'm concerned about... B/W digital photography is sometimes handicapped because we normally can view and print the images in 8 bits per pixel. When you got 3/4 channels, it gives you sufficient gamut, but when you got only 256 levels of gray, you'll probably be experiencing strange rendering effects in similar-tone subjects.<query> what is the lp/m ratio for digital photography</query> Moreoever, as you've mentioned, the Bayer algorithm normally performs well (when the image does lend itself to it) with retaining the original resolution... But when the original image does exhibit Moire patterns after been 'Bayer'ed, the b/w transposition (especially for b/w images based on a single-channel) is catastrophic. Foveon: I'd wish one of the big names would've supported F-technology. Just a wish... Bob Atkins , April 23, 2003; 07:08 P.M. Ilkka - 7m is pretty fast! I've just been using the ""free"" version of Neatimage to play around with. I didn't think the ""pro"" version was supposed to be any faster but maybe it is. Are you using the pro version? Otherwise it's hard to reconcile 7m vs 120m with only a 4x increase in CPU speed unless your machine is somehow a lot more efficient than mine (cache?).<query> how fast is neatimage</query> I have 512MB RAM, lots of free disk space and nothing else running on the machine. Win 2Kpro OS. Maybe some PC expert could shed light on this. Or maybe there's a new version of Neatimage I should try. David Littleboy (Tokyo, Japan) , April 23, 2003; 07:24 P.M. I was struck by how much better the resolution chart taken with the same lens looks in digital than in scanned Kodachrome. Most of the film partizans argue that scanning at 4000 dpi doesn't get all the information. So the question arises: if you look at the Kodachrome slide with a microscope, is it actually resolving more than the digital sensor??? Arthur Yeo , April 23, 2003; 07:44 P.M. The article is well executed and I enjoyed reading it. Applause to Bob!<query> what is the resolution of a kodachrome slide</query> Arthur Yeo , April 23, 2003; 07:48 P.M. I'm a little taken aback by the large bubbly grains of the Kodachrome25. Anyone know what's the specs of this discontinued product in terms of RMS grain size? Is the grain the same size as Velvia (or Provia?) ? Fabian Gonzales , April 24, 2003; 12:58 A.M. Very interesting and informative article. I also found the included Photomicrograph very interesting. I have long had the impression that film contains more detail than a 4000 DPI scanner can reproduce. I also suspect that film scanners exaggerate grain, and that as a result a large print will look better if printed on a traditional enlarger (although I have not tested this). But digital is clearly the way of the future, and some day even medium and large-format photography will be obsolete.<query> what grain size is velvia</query> Today however, one of the major drawbacks of consumer DSLR's is the small sensor size and the resulting focus multiplier. I do quite a bit of work at wide angles, and find the 1.6x multiplier to be really inconvenient. Bob Atkins , April 24, 2003; 01:20 A.M. Photomicrograph of K25 test slide This isn't meant to be a test of Kodachrome 25 or how well it scans on an FS4000us, so any data on those subjects shouldn't be used in that context. The FS4000US scan at 4000dpi does not, and should not be expected to, reveal all the detail that you can see in the slide. Under a microscope you can see finer detail than a 4000dpi scan can reveal. The very BEST a 4000dpi scan could do is 78 lp/mm and in practice it won't quite resolve detail at that level.<query> what is the focus multiplier on a dslr</query> A good lens will put close to 100 lp/mm on Kodachrome under optimum conditions (tripod, perfect focus, mirror locked up etc.). Here is a photomicrograph of the same section of the K25 slide. It reveals a little more detail than the 4000dpi scan. Not a whole lot more, but certainly a little more. It's possible a better lens would yield even more resolution and it's likely that the test pattern if shot on Technical Pan B&W film would yield significantly more resolution. The real question is, however, what happens in the real world, where you're not using mirror lock up, you don't have a prime lens set to f8, your subject is moving, you may or may not have a tripod and you are shooting ISO 100 or faster film. Under those conditions it's quite possible that a 4000dpi scan will extract all the useful information out of a slide or negative.<query> what is the best lens for a slide</query> Michael McCarthy , April 24, 2003; 06:39 A.M. Bob, thanks for the concise and accurate article. Your comment that the digital versus film decision depends on the workflow of the particular photographer is a key to understanding the issue and to coming to a conclusion that works for that photographer. I am a hobbyist and use film because the images appear more pleasing to me compared to digital, especially color range. Also, digital can't touch black & white film in my opinion. Furthermore, I don't take the film/slide/print image digital because I too can't afford drum scans and, if I could, digital output is not as pleasing to me. Unfortunately we can't compare a film based slide to a digital image online which makes my workflow defective in the online sharing of images category.<query> why do photographers use film</query> Thus, in my opinion, if one wants a slide or print, then film is better. If one wants a digital file, then digital may be better depending on the tastes and workflow of the photographer. I say ""may be better"" because, for photos presented on photo.net, the photos taken with a digital camera are usually distinguishable and less desirable than photos recorded on film, to my eye. However, this may result more from average years of experience in the two crowds than the camera. Bas Scheffers , April 24, 2003; 11:38 A.M. Great article. I often think of comparing digital and film to comparing CDs and LPs. CD wins on numbers but some people prefer the sound of LPs. The same is true with digital compared to 35mm where I find the ""feel"" of films like Velvia and Provia very pleasing.<query> which is better digital or film</query> That is not to say that digital isn't very good, I would switch to a 10D in a second if it made financial sense. But the camera + cards + very wide angle lens + other accesoiries will cost me 300+ films to earn back and shooting only 50 rolls or so a year, this would take me 6 years to earn back. Darn. Matt Carter , April 24, 2003; 01:22 P.M. Great article, but I would like to point out that while comparing the sharpness of digital vs film isn't exactly apples vs oranges, it's at least tangerines vs oranges. So in some ways these comparisons aren't important. Too many people are too obsessive about the digital vs film debate (and shapness in general). Digital will probably take the market for non-art applications.<query> how long does it take to get back a digital camera</query> Shutter speed was around 1/750s and the camera (or lens) was mounted on a sturdy tripod. Note that these images are 400% blowups from the original digital file. We are looking in close detail at the very limit of resolution so everything looks somewhat blurred. Here, in the center of the image, you can see that the better lens not only resulted in higher contrast, but also greater perceived sharpness. Resolution is limited by the sensor, not the lens, but the better lens does give a better image. The difference is less than you'd see on film under optimum conditions. Still, you can score one for the better lens. At the corner of the image the difference is more obvious. Again contrast with the better lens is higher, but in this case the cheaper lens is clearly showing much more chromatic aberration (green/purple fringes on the tangential lines).<query> what is the difference between a better camera and a better lens</query> Eventually it will be sharper/easier/quicker/cheaper than film for just about everything. But it will probably never have the ""chi"" for artistic work that traditional processes have. Even if it's in the form of ""negatives"" made from digital images, the printmaking process will always be around, if only as an art form. People are still making tintypes and using wet plates. For example,the ""sharpness"" of an email I type is way better than my horrible cursive, but if I'm writing a love note, it's going to be in my sloppy writing. And even when digital has a much higher resolution than film, I'm still going to be taking pictures of art-decco buildings with my vintage TLR on Tri-X and printing on fibre, because that's the look/feel I want.<query> why is printmaking still used</query> Too many photographers get caught up in the technology and forget about the art. Ilkka Nissila , April 24, 2003; 02:46 P.M. Bob, I'm using the pro version, with 512 MB RAM. My best guess is that Neatimage uses Wiener filtering and that's a linear operation, which Pentium IV with RIMMs does very fast indeed with the appropriate programming. I didn't notice any significant difference in the processing time by the demo vs. the pro version. It's interesting to see the photomicrograph. The difference is quite clear. I'm also scanning at 4000 dpi and I'm happy with the results when the slide is properly focused (especially since I don't want to deal with larger than 120 MB files in photoshop!). Still, 4000 dpi is enough to see significant differences in image quality between lenses.<query> what is the difference between a pro and a demo</query> Joel Benford , April 25, 2003; 06:57 A.M. Bob, I recently went from the free version of NeatImage to the pro version. The pro version takes about half the time to process an image. This is consistent over colour digicam images at a range of ISOs and also B&W film scans (XP2 and N1600). Several other folks have made the same observation. Good article, well thought out. Thanks, Borek Lupomesky , April 25, 2003; 09:38 A.M. I noticed the white halos around contrasty edges on 10D test images. Where they come from? Raivo Vanags , April 25, 2003; 10:05 A.M. Has anybody tested Canon 17-40 f/4L on 10D here? I'm confused as I was thinking about buying one but have seen some not so good comments about it and people saying that in fact Sigma 15-30 is better? 16-35 is out of my reach for now but used 17-35 could be an option (but t's focusing distance is twice of 17-40...).<query> what is the difference between a 10d and a 1740</query> Best, Ilkka Nissila , April 25, 2003; 02:04 P.M. The white surroundings to black lines are the result of edge contrast enhancement, ie. a sharpening filter operation. Due to the low noise in digital captures, you can apply it quite freely without the increase in grain that film images show (I assume the camera does it automatically to some extent). Of course, if you first run Neatimage, then you can use wild sharpening on film scans as well. Still I often prefer the original version with grain and no sharpening at A4 size, larger is another matter. On my machine, processing the same file with demo 2.2 vs. pro 2.3 takes exactly the same time. Mishkin Mishkin , April 25, 2003; 06:30 P.M. Another positive aspect of having better lenses: pixels will inevitably get smaller, and you won't need to buy new lenses to match the increased sensor resolution.<query> why do i have black lines on my camera</query> Buy quality optics once and use it all your life. Jose Roberto Wagner , April 25, 2003; 10:08 P.M. I think two hours is too much. Something must be wrong with the computer. In my PC, Neatimage Home Edition v 2.3 takes 8 minutes to process a 3976 x 2651 pixels image. 1.4MHZ Athlon - 512 MB RAM - 120 Gb HD in RAID. Regards, Bob Atkins , April 26, 2003; 12:34 A.M. The ""problem"" appears to be that Neatimage is optimized for the Pentium instruction set and my machine has an AMD K6 CPU. The FPU in the K6 is known to be slower than the Pentium FPU when the code is optimized for the Pentium. I actually get FASTER processing using a SLOWER Pentium II. With a 330 MHz Pentium II it takes about 40 minutes to process a 4000dpi scan of a 35mm slide.<query> how long does it take for a neatimage image to process</query> On a small test, the 330 MHz Pentium II was 30% faster than my 550MHz K6. Perhaps my 2 hour processing was on a particularly difficult scan. I'll run the test again. Whatever the cause, a PC upgrade wouldn't hurt! Wee Keng_Hor , April 26, 2003; 12:58 A.M. Great article, Bob! And thanks for all your recent effort to make Photo.net interesting again! Well, I will agree with Bob totally if the monitor is the ultimate output medium. But bear in mind that monitors and prints will give u variation in colour. With slides, u are seeing the 'true' or 'master' colour for other output medium to follow. And your image will appear more vibrant on a light box compared to a monitor screen. Bob Atkins , April 26, 2003; 01:08 P.M. True, but then viewing slides on a light box isn't the normal final use of slides.<query> what is the difference between a monitor and a slide</query> If it is, then there's no contest. A slide under a high quality 6x loupe on a light box blows away any monitor screen image. As for color, well, that's another issue. While a slide may give you a ""master"" image, it's not an absolute color reference. Shoot the exact same scene on Kodachrome 64, Velvia, Astia and 100VS, then tell me which slide is the ""master"" slide when it comes to color reference! Wee Keng_Hor , April 26, 2003; 07:36 P.M. Just a side note on image projection because slide shooters enjoy giving slide show: I know that there are some high end projectors for computers / laptops. Do these projected image provides better resoluton than the computer screen? And how do they compare to the images from a slide projector? Oskar Ojala , April 28, 2003; 02:25 A.M. More on NeatImage... A quick test between an 1.5 GHz Athlon with DDR333 memory and an older, 450 MHz Celeron with SDR100 memory gave running times of 10 min.<query> what is the best slide projector</query> for the Athlon, 40 min. for the Celeron (the image used was a crop from a scanned 6x6 neg, the amount of pixels processed was higher than a 4000 dpi scan gets from a 24x36 mm frame). This was using NeatImage demo. Memory size doesn't seem to matter as long as the program fits in memory (for winNT4 256 MB was enough, while winXP wanted over 400 MB for this image). So I think that a fast CPU (Athlon or Pentium 4) with fast memory are the keys to good NeatImage performance (incidentally, these two help photoshop performance too.) Bill O'Neill , April 28, 2003; 09:03 A.M. Bob and Ilkka, On the performance of NeatImage on PCs. There are many factors contributing the performance of a particular piece of software on a particular machine, not just CPU speed.<query> what is the cpu for coolimage</query> A few of these have been mentioned, such as type and speed of memory and the way a particular processor configures its pipeline for certain instruction groups. However, there are many other contributing factors as well. Such things as the chipset used on the motherboard, the operating system, the disk drives and the disk controller, other interfaces and their drivers and, in fact, how all these operate together in various combinations. Much like with photography the best way to decide on the right computer is to try it out. Just like with photography though, this is difficult to do. There are not a lot of computer shops that will allow you to install Photoshop on their systems and do some benchmarking. There are a few though. In the new digital age it seems that building the right relationships is still as important as ever.<query> what is the best way to decide on a computer</query> Vsevolod Krishchenko , April 28, 2003; 01:43 P.M. .. and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 are all good lenses I don't own this lens but have 24-85 and it is not good - very soft at 85 mm, distortion at 24mm, average sharpness between them. Yes, it is light and inexpensive, but no good in terms of optical quality. Acccording to photozone 28-105 is not better than 24-85 and all tests I saw online said that 28-105 is just an average consumer soom like 24-85 or 28-135 are. Still from time to time I hear the myth that 28-105, 28-135 and 24-85 are good (not cheap nor light but *good*!). Quite strange. Brian Sledz , April 29, 2003; 07:17 A.M. Bob, Great article and thanks for pointing out the Canon 10D actually has more density than many hgher MP cameras.<query> what is the best lens for canon 10d</query> Score another one for the better lens. So it's certainly true that better lenses give better results even on a 6.3 MP 10D. Does that mean you should only use ""L"" lenses - of course not. There are many excellent non-L lenses. For example the 50/1.8, the 24/2.8 and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 are all good lenses. In fact the 75-300 is a very good lens at the shorter end, but as you can see above does suffer somewhat when zoomed to 300mm and used wide open. It's still not bad, just not as good as the 300/4L. What is equally true is that you can't just say ""Well, the 10D doesn't have the resolution of film so it really doesn't matter what lens I use"". Just like with film, choice of lens is still a factor in image quality, though probably not quite as big a factor.<query> what is the best lens for a 10d</query> In one of the sections you showed the 70-200 at 187mm to show a similar FOV for the 10D and film, since there really is no magnification factor, only really a cropping due to the smaller sensor of the ccd, aren't the left and rightmost images comparing the slide and 10D the most valid? thank you again for this and other articles Brian Ilkka Nissila , April 30, 2003; 07:57 P.M. Peter, it's quite clear from Bob's images that the 10D cannot match the resolution of film if the reduced field is compensated by increased magnificationto yield a print of the same size. (Compare the middle and right images.) It also indicates that if the pixel density of the 10D is retained, a full-frame digital body would show significantly better results than K25. Anantha Narayan , May 02, 2003; 12:15 A.M. There is no comparison.<query> can 10d be compared to film</query> Rather there shouldn’t be. Just because you can print Digital pictures or just because you can scan film doesn’t mean you compare them both. The reasons are, that their purposes are different. The evolution of technology has given us the flexibility to use different mediums in realization and storage of pictures. First choose this medium of presentation, and then choose the technology to capture it. We sometimes get lost in the obvious and go in search of the oblivious. If you print a digital picture and compare it with a film print - of course film print is better. If you scan film and compare it with a Digital shot - of course Digital is better. When what you want is the best, why compromise to compare which is better than what? What is important is to understand the ""cost"" of convergence.<query> why is digital vs film better</query> The problem with that is “we need to have the cake and eat it too”! So how do you solve the problem? Get 2 cakes! Eat one and keep one. Get 2 cameras - one film and one digital (when you can carry some 10 lenses - can't you carry one extra tiny camera?). Yes, no kidding - its cheaper and better. Before we play the pixel game - Lets ask ourselves a question - What is the final size of your digital picture? And at what resolution? And what is the size of the monitor and its pitch that you or your friend might use, to see it? Then ask the question, ""So how much resolution is that?"" - You will end up with an answer that that will lead you to conclude that a tiny digital camera less than $400 is worth its while.<query> how much is a tiny camera</query> Do all else later - thanks to Photoshop. And, don’t throw that 'ol 35 mm away - its still got some shows left when you want to print. Wake up world!! Photography is art. It’s all about capturing the moment, the mood, and the very essence of time, that lets us reflect and document the past. Remember technology is just an enabler - it’s just the means to get there. Not the end in itself. So don’t go talking to your friends about your new 5MP - 20MP camera. Talk to them about the mood you captured - that lovely girl with a curl, that awesome shot at the ball game etc. Spend time, capturing time - so you can share a thought, or re-live a moment. That is what photography is all about. brian jackson , May 03, 2003; 04:10 P.M. First off, nice article.<query> what is photography about</query> Just to let everyone know, but I had a client order a 20x30 print from a recent event. I shoot with the EOS 1D(4.13MP, but larger sensor :-). A little color correction, dust spotting and very minor unsharp mask, set it to my lab(whcc.com) and WOW, this print looks amazing. BTW, this was a full frame in-camera large JPEG shot taken with a very nice f/2.8 L lens and 1.4X TC. This was the largest print I've ever made. Largest digital prints before were a few 18x24's and 16x20 from some Fuji 200 color neg scanned with a SprintScan 4000, same lab as above. Largest print from neg (Fuji Reala 100) was a 16x20 from a local pro lab. I'm going to have to say that the 20x30 was the nicest large print. Don't get me wrong, the others were great as well, two are hanging on my living room wall and the others were sold to clients.<query> what is the largest print ever made</query> Ironically all of these shots were full frame, so that helps. Bob- Do they still make Tech Pan 32? I haven't seen it in years :) Jawed Ashraf , May 04, 2003; 09:10 A.M. http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos1ds/page20.asp On this page are presented two photos: 1. Canon EOS 1DS 11MP 2. Canon EOS D60 6MP taken of the same scene, minutes apart, with controlled: exposure; focus; framing; BUT shot at different focal lengths (due to the 35mm-format crop factor in the D60) and using JPEG Large/Fine file format. Download both pictures (due to copyright restrictions I will not present crops from these two pictures here). Resize the 11MP 1DS picture to 3078x2048 (the D60 image is 3072x2048). Compare the two pictures. Unfortunately the picture is made up mostly of large areas of no detail.<query> what is the difference between a canon eos 1ds and a But there's some fine detail on the bottle labels, the apple and the watch face. A good area to compare is the ""yellow"" side of the apple and where it meets the Baileys bottle, specifically the text ""(Bail)ey & Co., Nangor Road"", and the rural scene on the label. Another good area is the Martini bottle's main label (which is arguably in critical focus with both cameras). In my opinion there are three reasons for differences in detail: 1. different focus plane/depth of field, and the fact that the camera was in slightly different positions when the two pictures were taken (parallax differences can be observed) 2. bayer sensors lose approximately 45% of the nominal pixel count of the picture, through the bayer process, i.e. a 6.3MP bayer picture is approximately equivalent to a 3.4MP full-colour-pixel picture.<query> what is the difference between baileys and baileys martini</query> 3. noise reduction by the D60 smears low-contrast and low luminosity detail. You can test 2. by resizing the 1DS image in Photoshop: a. size to 2278x1516 b. size to 3077x2048 (1 pixel of width lost in rounding) (Both resize operations using bicubic resampling.) Anyone prepared to post a more tightly controlled comparison? There is a real side effect of the ""lost"" resolution that bayer sensors incur. The approximately 45% pixel-count resolution-loss in a bayer sensor is approximately a 25% loss in linear resolution. In stating this, I'm ignoring the results that a comparison of resolution test charts produces (about a 23% loss, approximately a 4.8MP picture), since digital cameras' interpolation algorithms are usually optimised for these charts. Real world detail is not normally black and white... Simply put, this means that you need a lens with an excess 33% linear resolution to achieve the desired resolution of your digital camera's sensor.<query> what is the loss of resolution in a bayer sensor</query> Or, in other words, to achieve the 67lp/mm that the 10D's pixel-pitch implies, requires a lens capable of 90lp/mm. If you're shooting a resolution test target with a Canon DSLR then I estimate an extra 14% linear resolution is required, i.e. a lens capable of 76lp/mm on the D60. Of course, if you're using a camera with a Foveon-type sensor, there is no appreciable resolution loss caused by the sensor's colour-interpolation (since there is no colour-interpolation). So, a 67lp/mm lens on this camera is approximately equivalent in resolution to a 90lp/mm lens on a 6.3MP bayer sensor camera. According to (let's hope I've got the right lens...): http://www.photodo.com/prod/lens/detail/CaEF28-70_28LUSM-64.shtml the lens used to make these two pictures has a weighted MTF of approximately 81 for the 1DS picture's focal length of 70mm, and approximately 83 for the D60 picture's focal length of 43mm.<query> what is the resolution of a lens on a canon camera</query> This would imply that the lens is limiting the D60 in this test. For comparison, the 1DS pixel pitch implies a native 57lp/mm, which requires the lens to be capable of 76lp/mm, which it just achieves. Of course, all of this is ultimately theory - more tests needed! Landrum Kelly , May 05, 2003; 01:00 A.M. Bob, do this again in two years. (Anybody want to place any bets on the outcome?) There are a lot of new people coming along who are asking not only ""What should I buy?"" but also ""What should I be learning?"" The time invested in digital processing is going to give increasing returns. That invested in film processing is likely to give diminishing returns, at least at the 35mm level. All bets are still off at MF and LF for now, but look down the road--and not necessarily too far down the road.<query> what is the pitch of a 35mm lens</query> Just as an aside, one very interesting aspect of using a digital sensor is that, to a large extent, the image resolution is independent of the ISO setting. Above are resolution patches shot at ISO 100 and ISO 800. While the ISO 100 patch might not be quite as good as an equivalent film test and high resolution scan, the ISO 800 patch looks just as good! There's a bit more noise, but not enough to have any effect on resolution. You can't say that about film! What about film. Won't I get better results shooting film and scanning? In theory, yes. It's not difficult to show that film with 80 lp/mm resolution scanned at 4000dpi should give higher resolution than a 6.3MP digital image. 100 lp/mm film scanned on a drum scanner should be even better.<query> what is the resolution of a digital camera</query> Film will perhaps always be around, but it is going to be increasingly inconvenient, and probably increasingly expensive, and pretty soon that increasing expense will be very difficult to justify on any grounds, artistic or otherwise. Ilkka Nissila , May 05, 2003; 03:45 P.M. Time spent on learning photography should be spent on learning your subject matter and to use the visual language, not on ""film processing"" or some such silly thing. That's done by the lab you know. Even when shooting film, you use photoshop to do what you'd do with digital captures so the difference is just the image capture medium. To me, it's absurd to move to a new technology before it's mature & stable enough. The time for some people has come, but many things that I'm used to shooting would require a prohibitative investment in equipment to do in digital at this point.<query> what is the difference between film and photoshop</query> Yet in three years things will have changed. That doesn't mean that I won't shoot film. I probably will. I'm in no hurry - I have a working technique for doing what I like and need to do. Bob Atkins , May 06, 2003; 10:40 P.M. Jawed Just about any lens not made of plastic will easiliy resolve 100 lp/mm at f8. In fact most lenses will resolve closer to the theoretical limit of 200 lp/mm in the center of the frame. The reason they don't put that on film is that film isn't very good! So resolution is very much sensor limited rather than lens limited. Actually it's the MTF near the resolution limit of the sensor that counts when it comes to image quality near the resolution limit, but that gets us into a whole other area.<query> what is the resolution limit for a lens</query> Theoretical analysis is fine (if you get it right), but it's no substitute for doing the actual tests! Ilkka Nissila , May 07, 2003; 10:44 A.M. But as you decrease the pixel dimensions, the signal-to-noise ratio goes down quickly. If we want to retain high-ISO operation (many people do, including wildlife photographers!), the current pixel density is likely to stay. Of course, they may make higher resolution sensors for landscape and studio applications, but those will likely have a low volume & remain very expensive. Arthur Yeo , May 13, 2003; 12:57 A.M. Really well prepared article. It has high value for instructional purposes. There's seems to be one area which I was hoping this article would talk about: can DSLRs capture enough dMax for B+W images to rival scans from B+W negatives.<query> why do dslr cameras have low resolution</query> G . , May 18, 2003; 05:52 A.M. Blah blah... Magnus Back , May 24, 2003; 02:52 A.M. The scanned Kodachrome is nowhere near the result I get with my ""standard"" slide film Provia scanned with a Nikon LS-4000. I think that by choosing a slightly better film than the Kodachrome and a better scanner than the Canon the difference will be much bigger than suggested in this article. The DSLR still lags in the areas colour correctness, contrast and resolution. (But the gap is closing fast). My Canon Digital IXY S-400 is amazing! ///Magnus Robert Monaghan , May 26, 2003; 10:43 P.M. Gosh, Bob, where to start? You equate 67 pixels/mm to 67 lpmm. But it takes two sensors or pixels to image a line, one for the black dots, one for the white space.<query> what is the difference between a dslr and a kodach So 67 pixels/mm is at best 34 lpmm resolution on the DSLR. Similarly, if the FS4000 scanner is 78 pixels/mm, it is equivalent to ~39 lpmm (not 78 lpmm). So your calculations and comparisons and conclusions are based on wrong and inflated digital resolution numbers, right? Here are the simple facts: Kodak has estimated that 35mm mid-speed films are equivalent to roughly a 24 Megapixel sensor. Pop. Photo's lab tests suggested real world values of 40 megapixels for 35mm films in their tests. Fine grain films like Kodachrome 25 have much higher resolution, and should score above 100 MP equivalent. An AFIP researcher's peer reviewed paper determined one fine grain 35mm film as being 124.76 MP equivalent. So any consumer or amateur ""tests"" that conclude that a 6 MP DSLR equals 35mm film are simply wrong, based on these facts from film makers and lab tests.<query> what is the resolution of a 35mm film</query> Kodak etc. are right, and you-all are wrong ;-) The only thing you are ""testing"" is your scanner and your technique. Your scanner is acting as a ~40 lpmm low pass filter, blocking all high frequency image data from film. You concluded that K25 roughly equaled a 6 MP DSLR image. But Kodachrome 25 is more like a 100+ MP equivalent sensor, per above sources. So you have lost 94%+ of the image quality of film in your scanning process (from 100+ MP to 6 MP), right? This is equivalent to taking a 6 MP DSLR image and downsizing it to 640x480 pixel webcam image size (also ~94% loss). That's a pretty big error! It is also the same 16X factor by which kodachrome 25 is superior in resolution etc. to a 6 MP DSLR ;-)<query> what is the difference between k25 and kdslr</query> Let's move on to why digital cameras can't use the full high resolution and fine contrast response of even so-so 35mm lenses. Due to anti-aliasing needs, DSLRs have a low pass filter between the lens and the sensor. This low pass filter limits the high frequency data seen by the sensor to ~50-55 lpmm equivalent. So right away, any claims of DSLRs imaging above 55 lpmm (i.e., 67 lpmm here) are problematic, right? On the other hand, lenses using velvia and other fine grain films and good technique can do much better than 50 lpmm. Velvia is rated at 160 lpmm (1000:1 contrast) and 80 lpmm (1.6:1 contrast). So fine grained film has hugely more megapixels at 100+MP equivalence than any prosumer 6 MP DSLR sensor. Most 35mm lenses can easily deliver 200 to 450+ lpmm aerial resolution (at least centrally to your 1.6X sensor).<query> what is the resolution of a dslr camera</query> The low pass filter is going to reduce that to circa 55 lpmm and below before it gets to the DSLR digital sensor. This is like two racing cars, one able to do 200 mph and the other 450 mph, but both are stuck behind a police car in a 55 mph zone. As long as the police car (low pass filter) is there, you aren't going to exceed 55 mph (55 lpmm), regardless of how fast either car is ;-) Similarly, the sensor never sees the high frequency data from the lens, due to the low pass filter. So the sensor doesn't care if the lens is a really high resolution zeiss or leica optic delivering 450+ lpmm, or a so-so third party lens barely capable of delivering 200 lpmm aerial resolution. Both are delivering waaay more than the 50-55 lpmm limit imposed by the low pass filter.<query> what is the low pass filter on a dslr camera</query> Everything above the low pass filter limit is chopped off and never seen by the sensor. So the high resolution and high contrast benefits of the pricey lenses are lost on the digital sensor, due to its 50-55 lpmm low pass filter limits, right? The anti-aliasing low pass filter is the physical basis for the statement that high frequency response lenses (i.e., high resolution, high contrast) are NOT needed with digital sensors. Designers of digital lenses such as Schneider have noted this fact too. They have ""dumbed down"" their digital lens design resolution and contrast response to better match the digital sensor requirements, while improving other digital lens parameters that can make a visible difference. These factors include color fringing, as you noted, plus cost and distortion and flat image planes and so on. I was hoping that this would be a tutorial on those digital optics topics, and how they differ from film oriented lens designs.<query> what is the low pass filter limit on a digital camera</query> Instead, it was another erroneous effort to prove by amateur ""tests"" that a 6 MP DSLR is as good as fine grained Kodachrome 25 film. Kodak says that's wrong, and Kodak is right ;-) Similarly, the low pass filter in DSLRs blocks high frequency data from the lens. So selecting a lens for its high resolution and fine contrast is wasted effort on current DSLRs with a 50-55 lpmm low pass filter limit. The lens resolution isn't the limiting factor here, it is the low pass filter. Note that I am not saying you won't see any differences between lenses. You may be able to see some DSLR image improvements from higher cost lenses which are better corrected for color fringing, distortion, flatness of field, and other parameters. But the major $$ spent on higher resolution and fine contrast response for film lenses is going to be blocked by the low pass filter.<query> what is the low pass filter on a dslr</query> But those are just numbers. Also, resolution is not sharpness. Sharpness is a subjective quality that depends on contrast, acutance (edge sharpness) and resolution, moreover the perception of sharpness is related to some spatial frequency filtering that the eye/brain system does. Our perception of sharpness depends more on how well certain spatial frequency bands are reproduced and these aren't always the highest spatial frequencies. Grain and noise probably come into the equation too. There's much more to sharpness than just high lp/mm numbers. The only real way to judge which of two images is sharper is to look at them under the conditions that they will actually be looked at! Test Targets: Here's a comparison of a two digital and one scanned film shot of a cropped section of an image of a resolution test target (all corrected to the same size on screen).<query> what is sharpness</query> That's why Schneider and others are designed a new generation of digital lenses, trading off high frequency response for improvements such as flatter field curvature and lowering lens aberrations which can and will make a visible improvement in DSLR image performance. The flip side is that today's high dollar lenses, which have been optimized for high frequency response (i.e., high resolution and fine contrast) on film are a less than optimal match for current DSLR sensors. So don't expect that your lenses designed for film camera use will work as well as future digital lenses designed specifically for digital systems taking into account digital sensor limitations. A final point derives from the observation that even mid-speed 35mm film is at least 24 Megapixels equivalent or better, per Kodak. I have to assume that scanners will get even better, given that they have a long way to go as I've shown above ;-)<query> what is the difference between film and digital camera lenses</query> So today's film images may become tomorrow's 24 MP or 40 MP or even 100 MP images as scanner technology improves. Unfortunately, today's 6 MP image will always be a 6 MP image at best. So film offers higher quality today, and more benefits for future digital images as scanner quality improves. For those who want to challenge my analysis, you have to start by explaining why Kodak, Pop Photo, AFIPs, and other sources have all derived megapixel equivalents for film much higher than 6 MP etc. You also have to explain why higher resolution or finer contrast lenses can make a noticeable difference despite that low pass filter in there. Amateur ""tests"", especially any using scanners with film, have a large burden of showing how you did not lose 75-95%+ of the film resolution data, as here, to reach any conclusions about today's DSLRs being as good as film ;-) grins bobm Claudio Coltro Coltro , May 29, 2003; 10:12 A.M. Bob: Your article is very good, specially if you are determined to prove that for your case digital is better than film.<query> why is film better than film</query> At least for me, the photographer's issue is the lens, their cost, their weigh, and the fact that the older one gets the worse it gets to hand hold them and lug them around. The logic of compromising on the camera body, which has the least impact on the photographic result whilst keeping your huge and expensive lenses, sound a bit strange to me. If you are happy with 11""x8"" prints, I guess you could also use cheaper lenses than the beauties you own (300/4 L and the 400/4.5). Other combinations, film + 75-300mm vs digital + 300/4, could give similar results in the smaller prints you are happy with. The difference is that probably the second combination of equipment would be much easier to handle, carry around, and much cheaper. Thanks for your article.<query> what is the difference between digital and film</query> Claudio Joseph Albert , June 13, 2003; 03:34 P.M. I think it is important to keep in mind that what matters is not whether a digital sensor can capture all the information on a low speed, high resolution transparency or negative, but whether an image captured by a digital sensor can produce a print that matches the quality of a print made from a transparency or negative. Once you scan the film or enlarge it with an enlarging lens and print on some sort of paper, much lower resolutions are observed. The question then becomes, ""what resolution digital sensor is needed to make digital prints that rival a print made from a given piece of film whether the film is scanned and printed digitally or printed directly as an Ilfochrome, silver, or C print? I don't know the answer to this, but I'd be amazed if it were anything close to 100 megapixels.<query> what is the resolution of a digital camera</query> I'm guessing that around 20-25 megapixels will pretty much obsolete a 35mm SLR, and 40-50 megapixels will do in medium and large format cameras/backs. But it's just a guess. Ryan Joseph , June 15, 2003; 12:48 P.M. Hi everyone, This article is ultimately very practical. People have brought up some very valid technical points about how Bob's test was ""unfair"". However, living in Jamaica, it is VERY expensive to get film drum scanned, anywhere for that matter. I look at this article from the point of a home viewer. I believe that film scanners do give film justice, however image quality is very subjective. In my opinion film still has some kick left in it, as I can vouch by the very high quality of the slides my FM2 produces.<query> how many megapixels do you need for a camera</query> Borrow a good film camera, then a good digital. Shoot to your hearts content with both and then compare the results, choose the one you like. All this tecnical stuff I have read gives me a serious heaadache. We must remember however, digital IS advancing, but so is film. Kodak's new Ektachrome E100G film is an example of this with almost nonexistent grain and amazing resolution. It blows away anything I have seen digital produce, but I am sure in X amount of time after I have written this digital will up the ante again. Then again a new wonder film will come out. BTW, if you want ultimate print quality, nothing beats a cibrachrome print made from a slide. Robert SIlvers , June 17, 2003; 02:30 A.M. Robert Monaghan, Bob does not need to explain why better lenses give better results on DSLRs even though there is an optical low-pass filter.<query> what is the best film camera for digital</query> He already explained that convolutions multiply MTFs and a better lens will always improve the result. In fact this is so obvious that I feel that Bob did not even need to mention it and give it so much space in his article. I feel that 35mm film is at best a 6000x4000 equiv. You could call that 24MP, but most cameras seem to count color matrix photosites, so perhaps it would take a 72mp camera to match film in resolution although the film would be really gritty at that point. But the EOS 1Ds does seem to produce great results without the problems of scanning, with the exception of highlight detail. But hey, slides also have bad highlights. Can I produce an image with slide film better than an EOS-1Ds? Of course, but it is mostly not worth it. I no longer have any interest in images that are not digital in the end.<query> what is the best resolution for a camera</query> So with that being the case, scanning many images is too much trouble. I just shot 14 rolls of film and am scanning them at 4000dpi. It will take me over a week to scan them, even though I did not cut the negatives. I put in a roll, and wait 3 hours. Put in another, and then go to work, and put in another before bed. I am done with 35mm film. I still except to use 4x5 and maybe 6x9. Pierre-Yves de Brito , June 26, 2003; 01:34 P.M. Hi every one ! about the comparison between digital & film : why do every one compare them on the computer, after having the film scanned? If the final material is the print, why not take a good picture of a landscape with beautiful colors (a real pic, not a chart test pic...) with a DSLR, and a Film SLR (vith velvia for instance) at the same time (same light) with different focal lengths to have the same field of view on both supports, and then print your DSLR file onto a big print, print your velvia slide onto a reversible paper of the same size (cibachrome, fuji supergloss, etc...<query> how long does it take to scan a roll of film</query> _am I right about the names? _) and compare them. For that matter, you can scan both prints with a good flatbed scanner. I would be very interested to see the results with this protocol (I don't have a DSLR, so I can't do it myself). What do you think about that? Norman Koren , July 04, 2003; 09:44 A.M. I'm addressing this response to Robert Monaghan, who maintains an excellent website on image sharpness, because it contains too many misconceptions to go unchallenged. Most readers who've compared EOS-10D images to the sharpest 35mm film images already realize that Bob M's comments don't add up. To start out, the pixel spacing of the EOS-10D is 7.4 microns, or 135 pixels per mm. TheNyquist frequency-- the highest spatial frequency for meaningful data-- is therefore 67 line pairs per mm (lp/mm), not 34.<query> what is the sharpest eos image</query> The lowpass filter (lpf) in the sensor is designed to block most energy above this frequency, which could result in artifacts like Moire. Similarly, a 4000 dpi scanner operates at 157 pixels pixels per mm, for a Nyquist frequency of 78 lp/mm. Since a 35mm image is 1.6x larger than the 10D image, it has a simple pixel advantage of approximately 1.86. Digital cameras do as well as they do because film loses a lot of detail. Now as for the estimates by Kodak, Pop Photo and others that it takes between 24 and 100 megapixels for a DSLR to equal film, I want to see the exact references to I can analyze them-- examine their assumptions and reject them. Hearsay won't do! The 11 megapixel EOS-1Ds is a good reality check. I'd challenge anybody to produce better 35mm color images than the 1Ds.<query> what is the difference between a 10d and a 35mm image</query> The rightmost image is a section of a shot of a test target taken with a 300/4L lens at f5.6 on Kodachome 25 film and scanned at 4000dpi with a Canoscan FS4000US scanner. The leftmost image is a shot taken with the EOS 10D 6.3MP camera with the same lens from the same distance. Since there's a 1.6x ""digital multiplier"", the field of view of the 35mm image was cropped. The leftmost image compares the native resolution of the 10D sensor with Kodachrome 25 scanned at 4000dpi. As you can see, there's really not a lot of difference. Note that the 6.3 MP sensor on the 10D is about 15 x 22mm. If we had a full frame 24 x 36 mm sensor with the same pixel density it would be a 16 MP sensor, so you can think of the 10D as having a cropped 16 MP full frame sensor!<query> what is the resolution of the eos 10d</query> There are reasons why photographers use medium and large formats, and they have to do with the limitations of film. Kodachrome 25 (discontinued) performance is in Kodak Technical Bulletin E-55. The true indication of its sharpness is MTF-- Modulation Transfer Function-- contrast at a given spatial frequency relative to low frequencies. It is 50% at 43 lp/mm and 10% at 77 lp/mm. These numbers are good, but not extraordinary. Fujichrome Provia 100F has a 50% MTF frequency of 40 lp/mm. Other well-known slide films (Velvia, Ektachrome, etc.) are similar. Negative films, especially B&W, tend to be better. MTF curves are available at manufacturer's websites. They tell the story about real film resolution. The ratings Bob M cites of 160 lpmm (1000:1 contrast) and 80 lpmm (1.6:1 contrast) have limited meaning, especially for 1000:1 contrast.<query> what is the mtf of kodak provia</query> They refer to ""resolution"" defined as just noticeable contrast difference-- at most 1.05:1 contrast on the film, maybe as low as 1.02:1. So Velvia at 80 lp/mm would have MTF of 0.05/0.6 = 8% MTF at 80 lp/mm. Velvia specs aren't on Fuji's website, but this is about right for Provia. The 1000:1 contrast may be of some interest to astronomers, but is of no value for terrestrial images. It corresponds to MTF of about 0.05/1000 = 0.005 percent. Any texture would be absolutely flattened at this spatial frequency! The 200-450+ lp/mm aerial resolution of lenses is similarly impractical-- it's like rating a maximum car's speed in RPM. Sorry, but the rubber has to meet the road, and most lens manufacturers publish MTF charts. These charts typically display MTF percentage for for 40, 20, and 10 lp/mm.<query> what is mtf in velvia</query> MTF at 40 lp/mm is considered to be an indication of lens sharpness. I admit I'd like to see MTF at higher resolutions. It's extremely low at 200+ lp/mm. But the biggest issue is 4,000 dpi scanner performance. Bob M estimates that 4000 dpi scanners lose 75-95%+ of the film resolution data. I won't bore you with the details here-- it's on aweb page-- but my analysis shows that 4000 dpi scanners can capture about 80% of the detail on film (linearly). That would be 64% area information. Not too bad. I welcome the new 5400 dpi Minolta 5400 scanner-- it will be a modest improvement. More importantly, I found that a print from a properly sharpened 4,000 dpi scan is slightly sharper than the best traditional darkroom print, which has to pass through an enlarging lens, and can't benefit from sharpening.<query> what is the dpi of a minolta scanner</query> I have a portfolio full of prints to prove this. I can easily fool people into thinking they're medium format. The bottom line is what your eyes tell you, and my eyes tell me that the 10D is a damned fine camera. I can make 13x19 inch prints almost as sharp as my best 4,000 dpi scans (but grainless), and every bit as sharp as the best prints I made from 35mm in the traditional darkroom. I wish I could afford the 1Ds, but then I'd need a 24 inch Epson 7600 printer to take full advantage of it. One day... My thanks to Bob A for putting up this excellent page. Pierre-Yves de Brito , July 04, 2003; 01:43 P.M. Hi Norman! there is an issue when everyone tackles this matter : partiality. when someone has invested money in DSLR, he tends to prove to himself and the others that this medium is far better than film.<query> what is the best camera for medium format</query> And your word only adds to this certitude. you say at the end >>I can make 13x19 inch prints ALMOST as sharp as my best 4,000 dpi >>scans (but grainless), 4000 dpi doesn't deliver the detail of film, this is obvious (the scan/photoscope comparison and your link describe it well) The thing is that you all raise figures of MTF and lines/mm where we just want to see real comparisons of real scenes, under fair circumstances (that is the best way to print the 2 medium if the print is your final material) if the best way to print them for you is through a 4000 dpi scan, then you would do well better with a 5400 scan, etc... if you shoot film, you are not limited by the current scanner technology, you'll be able to scan it with a better scanner later on if you wish.<query> what is the best dpi to print a picture</query> If you shoot digital, you're limited by the current ccd/cmos technology, and your images are frozen. and remember that the best way to see a slide is with a projector, which is a completely other world (you won't contradict me on that point) and digital stays on screens and paper. but I'm falling the other way, defending film against digital. I'd simply want to see real examples of texture (hair foliage far away, road textures, etc) taken on film and on DSLR (with different focal lengths to have the same field of view) to see the different rendition. An objective test would require to try honnestly to get the best result from both mediums. I don't want to be polemic on the subject, I'd like to know the pros and cons of each medium from objective minds, that's all.<query> what is the difference between film and digital camera</query> to conclude, let's take pictures with what we have, and enjoy it, there is no need to battle in line to convince everyone that the other medium is INFERIOR to the one we use. the 2 mediums are different, comparisons are interesting to know which one we prefer, if we want to change/when, but don't take this battlefield position, please. peace & love my friends ;-)) , and happy shooting above all !! cheers ! Pierre-Yves de Brito , July 04, 2003; 01:55 P.M. request to bob : could you put a sample of bark from the 2 sample pictures you have? it would be interesting to see their texture. Thanks! D.J. Wilkins , July 04, 2003; 08:22 P.M. There are a number of sites that show ""real"" photo comparisons between film and digital --http://www.sphoto.com/techinfo/dslrvsfilm.htm is Steve Hoffmann's site with Canon 10D, 1Ds, and film comparisons.<query> what is the difference between film and digital photography</query> 1Ds blows away a Nikon Super Coolscan 4000 ED of Provia 100 ASA, and even the Canon 10D appears to match or exceed the film scans. I'm a Nikon user (since 1956, as well as a Linhof & Bronica user) and have a newly acquired D100 that is providing image quality I wouldn't have believed from 6 MP. I've been scanning film for years, at up to 4000 dpi, and the D100 is providing image quality pretty near the best scans I've done, and better than many scans. As Steve mentions on his site, with digital, there is one lens system to contribute distortion and aberrations, with scanning, there are two, not to mention possible film flatness problems both in-camera and in-scanner. Norman Koren's comments above are accurate as always (and his images, especially his large prints viewed in person, are testimony to his mastery of the medium).<query> what is the best camera to scan film</query> The comments by Bob Monaghan puzzle one for their lack of accuracy. One should check facts before attacking someone else's presentation. And finally, Bob Atkins is to be commended for his excellent presentation in this forum. Pierre-Yves de Brito , July 07, 2003; 09:38 A.M. thanks for the link, very interesting. but it is a comparison between DSLRs and scanned film, not really between DSLR and film... ;-) D.J. Wilkins , July 10, 2003; 12:21 P.M. thanks for the link, very interesting. but it is a comparison between DSLRs and scanned film, not really between DSLR and film... ;-) Since I shut down my chemical darkroom several years ago, I won't be doing any comparisons between optical prints from film and DSLR prints in my own lab. I have some 11x14 and 16x20 optical prints that I made with my Durst L1000, CLS 450 colorhead, Schneider/and/Nikkor enlarging lenses from negatives made with my Linhof Kardan 4x5.<query> what is the difference between dslr and dslr</query> They are very sharp. And I have made prints of the same negatives scanned last year, and printed at the same size using one of my inkjets. Note, the scanner is an Epson 2450, so the amount of image information I've scanned is less than possible with a really top-end scanner. And yet the scanned-film prints look better overall than the optical prints. Unless you use a magnifying glass to see the ink droplets, the inkjet prints look pretty much identical even on close inspection (actually, the color is better on the inkjet prints). From those tests I was convinced that a good inkjet print looks like a good optical print. And I was comparing a scan made using the Epson 2450 to a print made using a top enlarger with excellent optics. This still doesn't address optical print versus DSLR.<query> what is the difference between an inkjet and an optical print</query> That's better than any current DSLR, better than the 11 MP Canon 1Ds and even better the 14MP Kodak 14n. Yes, it's true, the 10D has a higher pixel density than either the 1Ds or the 14n - but of course the sensor is 1.6x smaller so the total pixel count is less. Given this and all the hype (some deserved, some not deserved) about the 1Ds and 14n being better than 35mm film it shouldn't be surprising that the left and rightmost images are quite similar. However comparing the native resolution of the sensor to scanned film isn't really a fair comparison in real world applications. To get the same digital shot with the same magnification and field of view as the film shot we need to use a lens 1.6x shorter in focal length, i.e. 187.5mm, so the center image was shot with a 70-200/4L zoom set to 187.5mm and f5.6.<query> what is the difference between a 10d and a 35mm film</query> I've also made prints from my D100 enlarged to 12x18, and they look excellent. In fact, the lack of grain, and the purity of color, produce prints that look better than many of my enlargements from 35mm shot on Reala 100 and Supra 100. And those look really good. I have access to a couple of Noritsu printers (digital and optical), and plan to make some tests where I'll run prints on the same printer from film and compact flash (same image taken using the same lens) -- but this comparison still will use scanned film (which is what the digital Noritsu uses). I can also use the optical Noritsu to print the film-based images. Unfortunately, this wouldn't really show what a good optical print can look like since these automated printers use very diffuse light to limit effect of scratches (the digital Noritsu uses Digital ICE).<query> what kind of printer does noritsu use</query> My advice would be to get a good Nikon or Canon 6 MP DSLR, shoot pictures, print them, share them, and enjoy them. After 40+ years of photography, including running a commercial business (photography and custom color printing), I'll never go back to a chem lab. I will continue to use film, especially in large format, but scan it. And I'll be shooting the vast majority of my work digitally. Frank Suchodolski , September 18, 2003; 12:36 P.M. I just wanted to add a comment about the 10 D, and digital in general. Right now I'm unsing a Canon EOS 33 wich is a fantastic camera. With Kodak Supra 100 and my EF 50 1,4 and EF 85 1,8 I got razor sharp and ultra fine grain prints made at my local Fuji Frontier lab.<query> what camera do i use for digital photography</query> The 10 D seems to be a digital version of the EOS 33. The thing about digital that I like is that I can see the result right after I get home, no lab anymore, no cost for rolls, no waiting. I did read this whole thing about digital not beeing as good as film. So I wanted to know if the 10 D is good enough and downloaded some some original, unedited full size images from the web and gave them to my frontier lab to make prints. I just got them back. I am completete blown away! It's even better than in my wildest dreams!!! It's true, unedited shots look a bit soft on your screen, but that's because you can do all the sharpening later. I you take these ""soft"" pictures to the lab, the come out RAZOR SHARP!<query> what is 10 d</query> Belive me, the quality, is 10 times better than film! This is even more amazing if you know that the sensor of the 10 D is a lot smaller, so the pictures have to be enlarged more to get a print of the same size. And they look even better! The colors... everything. But the most important thing: The grain! There is NO GRAIN! Kodak Supra 100 had a little bit of grain, alsmost perfect. But it's such a low quality compared to the 10 D. You can stick your nose right on the print and you'll see no grain!!! Amazing. Now, I'll sell my EOS 33 and get the 10 D. I can't wait... what a quality... Scott Robertson , October 29, 2004; 04:58 P.M. Great article, Bob. I too have discovered that, since I began shooting with a 6 MPix DSLR, I have barely touched my film cameras.<query> what is the grain on a kodak 10 d</query> For my style of photography and printing and considering my workflow, the finished quality I get with digital is at least as good as what I used to get scanning slides. I occasionally do want ultra-high resolution for very large format prints, but lugging around a large format camera isn't very practical for me, and I can't really afford to have 4x5 transparencies drum scanned. So, I do what a number of other photographers are doing these days - I stitch a number of 6 Mpix frames together to make a huge final image. This really only works for static subjects, like landscapes, but these are what I used to use my 4x5 camera for anyway. A briefarticle on creating ultra high-resolution images via image stitching can be found on my web site. Mark Phillips , November 05, 2004; 08:04 A.M. Very interesting Bob.<query> what is stitching in photography</query> From a repoduction point of view I would agree with you. Having spent the last 25 years of my life in prepress I can tell you that 2 years ago I wrote digital images off. I knew I could get a seriously better result from scanning a tranny than a digital image. Not so now! How times have changed. If I want output an image say at A2 size, a good digital shot (maybe colour corrected in CMYK) will give just as good a result as a sharp 5x4 tranny......... if not better! Our company now only drum scans images that are a)supplied as tranny/print or b)needs to be output AO+. Most of our clients now supply digital images placed in their jobs. Not so good for us as we don't do as many scans as we used to but we can get through our workload much faster.<query> what is the difference between a digital and a tranny scan</query> As long as the photographer and designer know what they are doing, the printed job will be just as good as if we drum scanned the images. Let's face it, I can output an image on our epson 9500 plotter at A2 size that I shot on my pocket size Canon S50 and get just as good a result as a drum scan from a 2 1/4"" tranny. Why bother with film? I now swear by digital. I am indeed a convert, and things will only improve. If you are still a believer in film for hi-res reproductions it's time to open your eyes and smell the coffee. Digital imaging is here and film WILL BE GONE sooner than you think. Daniel Erwin , January 02, 2005; 11:39 P.M. I agree with the commenters who say the most meaningful comparison is to use actual prints (I have no desire to get a PhD in digital imaging...<query> what is the difference between film and digital imaging</query> I'd rather put my energy into creating beautiful images that people want to display TYVM!). Bill Brandt once wrote the following about photography, ""It is the result which counts, no matter how it is achieved."" Therefore, I think a more meaningful comparision is between scanned film and digital capture, because most magazines and calendar companies these days work with scanned transparencies, and a lot of larger display prints (e.g., corporate and govenment art from medium and large format film) is made this way too now rather than with the traditional enlarger. I'm coming from the perspective of a 35mm transparency shooter (Velvia 50 mostly) that I submit to magazines who turn the trannies over to their prepress houses for quality scanning (not always a drum scan unless necessary) for 300 dpi reproduction using CMYK offset printing (not a home inkjet printer).<query> what is the difference between digital and scanned film</query> Currently I'm considering retaining my Canon 24-70 f/2.8L and 70-200 f/2.8L lenses and trading in my EOS 1V (that I initially bought to shoot sports action for magazines) for an 11MP 1Ds (since the 16.7 MP 1Ds MK II is financially out of my reach). However, of late I've really gotten into scenic images, and my goal is now to make prints up to 16x20 (and possibly 20x24 on occassion) as well as increase my calendar work. I know one top pro who routinely makes up to 30x40 gallery prints of sports action shots from his 1Ds and 300mm f/2.8 IS L prime (one of Canon's sharpest lenses), and they sell like hotcakes. However, Arizona Highways magazine doesn't accept digital capture at all, saying that output from an 11MP DSLR isn't sufficient for landscapes, which they opine is still the principal domain of 4x5 (although they will accept ""exceptional"" medium format and even 35mm trannies, though mostly of wildlife in the latter case).<query> what is the best canon lens for landscapes</query> Contrary to one reviewer above, I am one of those photogs who shoots all my static images with a tripod, cable release, f/8 or f/11 (to minimize image degradation from diffraction), a lens hood and MLU when appropriate, since it is necessary to wring every drop of resolution out of 35mm as possible since I'm competing with pros shooting 645 MF or 4x5 LF. In the alternative, I'm giving serious consideration to trading my Canon setup in for a 645MF system that would allow me to shoot scenics with 120 roll film now (again mostly Velvia 50 using every image acquisition optimizing technique above), and switch to a digital back later once the technology matures and prices come down from the stratosphere (6x7 SLRs are too heavy to drag into the field). I'm even thinking about getting a lightweight 4x5 view camera as a third alternative (and keeping the Canon system and upgrading it to digital later when prices come down to more reasonable levels).<query> what camera system do you use to shoot static images</query>"

Its stock touched $600 on Thursday, which represents $560 billion in market capitalization. Compare this to Exxon Mobil, with a market cap of $400 billion, IBM's $240 billion and Wal-Mart's $210 billion. Can Apple really be worth that much? The easy answer is that the company is worth whatever the market says it's worth. Well, yes, the market is right every day—but it is right only for that day. What about tomorrow?

clueweb12-0005wb-89-08505,44,1,"Microsoft IBM 9093 IBM11 - PRIVATEERING WITH MICROSOFT L'Etat C'est Moi IBM Bearing True Gifts QDOS IBM Loses Its Bottle Windows Skunkworks Windows 3.0 Windows NT Windows 95 Macintosh Underdog Strategy Visionary AOL Internet Proper XML .NET Battle for the Internet Linux Financial Performance Lessons According to Microsoft Privateer Shark The Trial For once, in this book, this short chapter is specifically about Bill Gates and Microsoft. In the context of the tragic side of IBM's history which much of this book describes, he used his place as an 'illegitimate pretender' to the IBM fortune to usurp its position!<query> who is microsoft's privateer shark</query> The obvious choice was DR (Digital Research), led by Gary Kildall, whose existing operating system CP/M (Control Program/Monitor) was the most popular one then on the market; and, adopting an unusually gentlemanly approach, even Bill Gates (who had an agreement with Kildall to keep out of his market[viii]) had pointed IBM in this direction. Its president, one of Silicon Valley's 'accidental' entrepreneurs (who, typically for the time, had originally called the company 'Intergalactic Digital Research[ix]), Unfortunately though, according to legend, Kildall blew his chance of becoming a billionaire when he played so hard to get that he wasn't even there when IBM first called (though the managers from PC Group had an appointment). According to some reports, in a tale which has grown with every retelling but in this case supposedly originating with Bill Gates[x] himself, having had a (very expensive as it turned out) contretemps with his wife, he was out for a spin in his plane.<query> who is the president of ibm</query> The Lessons According to Microsoft Besides his other mistakes in forward thinking, Gates also failed to buy AOL, which - in view of the longer term potential for Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) networking may also come back to haunt him; and, even worse, his own response, Microsoft Network (MSN) was unreliable (a not infrequent Microsoft problem!), and initially didn't even work with Windows 95, and a relative failure. On the other hand, according to Des Dearlove[lxxiii], Microsoft attributes its success to: · a long term approach · results orientation · teamwork and individual drive · a passion for its products and customers; and · continuous customer feedback It is certainly results-oriented and Bill Gates undoubtedly has a genuine passion for his products, and Microsoft became the US symbol of a technology culture though the inhabitants of Silicon Valley thought that it was a copycat and fast follower rather than a genuine innovator; but I have less faith in the others - unless you count Microsoft's predilection for beta testing - putting out pre-release copies of the software for customers to test (or, as is often the case, to debug) the products as 'feedback'.<query> what is microsoft's success</query> On the other hand, Dearlove continues with what I suspect is the most important element which is only hinted at above; ""The company hires very bright, creative people and retains them through a combination of excitement, constant challenge, and excellent working conditions. The odd stock option helps too."" He is talking here of the more favoured of the two classes of employee, those in the product (development) groups who receive the lion's share of these benefits - where Gates regards 'writing code' (programming) as a higher calling - and the 'rest' are sometimes treated as the second class citizens he seemingly thinks they are; and, in particular quarter of its workforce who are temporary have almost no rights at all.. The company very successfully balances its famously demanding attitude to performance, where on the one hand 12 hour days are the rule and a full-time presence on site is demanded (with, rather surprisingly, teleworking discouraged [lxxiv]).<query> what is the difference between a company and a company</query> On the other it has a relaxed collegiate style - its headquarters at Richmond, with buildings to the design he admired at IBM, is indeed referred to as the Microsoft campus - and there is a dislike of any status symbols, where its employees dress informally, have the same furniture and identical (nine feet by twelve) offices - which helps when the frequent moves in group membership take place On the other hand, unlike in IBM, where 'open-plan' is still in vogue, each individual has a private office to themselves; so they can indulge in 'private thinking'. David Bank[lxxv] comments on its management culture, that (by the mid 1990s) ""Here was a company, a big company, where smart people ruled. Hierarchies and chains of command didn't matter.<query> what is ibm's culture</query> Overt aggression was cultivated, not tamed…for those who could play the game, the meritocracy was thrilling."" He added the footnote that the players were "" Almost entirely male, most were about to turn forty years old…old enough to internalize the baby boomer sense of their own unlimited potential…post industrial society was emerging, and a new class was rising. The power of the new, educated elite flowed from the manipulation of language and symbols…outcasts derided as nerds could attain unheard-of-wealth."" The result, as described by John Heilemann[lxxvi], is that ""The feelings that many employees had for their boss went beyond respect or loyalty or admiration and crept right up to the brink of infatuation: in one way or another, everyone in Redmond seemed to have a crush on Bill"". Dearlove's list of reasons for Microsoft's success is: · be in the right place at the right time - Bill Gates really is the luckiest individual alive · fall in love with the technology - he is just as lucky that the love of his life is the technology he plays with, and understands so well.<query> why did microsoft become successful</query> Indeed, it is significant that Steve Ballmer is CEO, handling all the 'routine' admin, whilst Gates has moved to become Chairman and, most importantly, Chief Software Architect - something almost unheard of elsewhere. One has to ask, however, what this new title means since - despite his defenders claims that ""What Bill cares about is writing great software "" - he reportedly[lxxvii] hasn't written any significant amounts of code since 1983, and his great strength has been making the deals which earned him billions - though those claiming to know him best say ""For Bill it's all about winning; the money's incidental"". · take no prisoners - as everyone, especially the US Justice Department, now knows he relentlessly crushes competitors · hire very smart people - in his case those with the highest IQs, straight from college; from the 120,000+ candidates who apply to Microsoft each year.<query> who is the ceo of microsoft</query> Above all, he looks for those he thinks are 'super smart' and (given his comments on the perishability of software) in particular can grasp new knowledge quickly[lxxviii]. He also ruthlessly headhunts the best people from other companies; paying them whatever is needed to get them. He even buys small software companies lock stock and barrel not just for their products but for their 'in-house programming assets'[lxxix]. · learn to survive - his is a voracious learning machine, though his competitors probably need the learning far more than he does · don't expect any thanks - he has become infamous, but that has almost been of his own choice · assume the visionary position - as I have already said, this is certainly what Gates would have us believe, but is in reality far from the truth.<query> what is the role of gates</query> Indeed, as Dearlove[lxxx] says elsewhere, ""In fact Gates himself is not an original thinker and does not actually rate people who are obsessed with original solutions to problems. Most people have only one brilliant idea in their entire lifetimes, he says. He believes that most solutions already exist somewhere and simply have to be identified. This he believes is his own great talent…"" I suspect he is right. I certainly applaud Gates' choice of The Economist (which he apparently reads from cover to cover, as I do) as the main source of his ongoing knowledge about the world. He, no doubt, would have concurred with the first paragraph in its new Economist Technology Quarterly (supplement)[lxxxi], where it says: "" Ideas are ten a penny…what makes a successful innovation…is the single-mindedness with which the business plan is executed, as countless obstacles on the road to commercialisation are surmounted, by-passed or hammered flat."" You could have no better justification for Gates' approach to development.<query> who is bill gates</query> · cover all the bases - the numbers game certainly represents a crucial aspect of his success, since (although hidden from sight), like IBM at its peak, his teams develop many more products than he ever shows to the world. Just as important, and as he showed in his approach to the Internet, when he is finally persuaded that he has made a mistake he is not afraid to do a U-turn. · build a byte-sized business - relative to its Wall Street valuation it is a small company, but even then its strength comes from its many businesses; each of which does not have more than two hundred staff . never, ever take your eye of the ball - he very clearly is obsessed with making money, and constantly worries (as did Tom Watson Jr.) about Microsoft becoming complacent and being overtaken by its competitors (as it earlier overtook IBM).<query> what is the most important thing to tom watson did</query> He has said[lxxxii] ""I know very well that in the next ten years, if Microsoft is still leader, we will have had to weather at least three crises."" Neither mention what seemed to be the main characteristic of Microsoft, set very personally by Bill Gates, that of total (centralised) control by one man. He ruled it with an iron rod; through just two groups of people, one of just three members and the other with seven; though it is not clear, now that he has moved on from being CEO, that he can still do this. Shark Mitch Kertzman, CEO of Sybase is quoted[lxxxiii] as, very perceptively if a little forcefully, saying that ""…Bill is the great white shark that looks at the minnows with no more consciousness than we look at a plate of food…The shark has no soul.<query> who is the ceo of microsoft</query> It know no boundaries. All it has is an appetite. When the shark gets hungry, it thinks, 'I'm hungry', so it eats. "" Until recently, however, few of his many admirers - including the business journalists in the media - mentioned his very tough, indeed sometimes questionable business tactics. Yet Microsoft, under Gates, is all about winning. Its famed motto """"A computer on every desk and in every home"" is an aggressive enough target, but the end of this slogan - now discretely implicit rather than overt as it originally was - ""…all running Microsoft software"" is an incitement to monopoly. The statement, by those claiming to know him best, that ""For Bill it's all about winning; the money's incidental"" offers an even better insight.<query> what is microsoft's motto</query> In fact, he was actually away on a previously booked business trip. In his absence, his wife - the who actually ran the business end of things - initially refused to sign the standard (but legally complex) non-disclosure agreement IBM managers placed in front of her; which - weighed down by IBM's legal baggage - they had to get signed before any substantial negotiations could take place. Despite the apocryphal stories, though, she did eventually sign[xi], albeit perhaps not fast enough for IBM. Some commentators say, again incorrectly, that her husband wasn't even contactable later or that he was just as offended by the non-disclosure agreement. More important, most say he wouldn't change the CP/M operating system to handle the 16 bits the IBM PC needed to use- or perhaps more believably wouldn't do this fast enough to meet IBM's near impossible deadlines.<query> who refused to sign ibm non disclosure agreement</query> It is not even the end that for him justifies the means, but simply the win. This might have earlier been seen as surprising, since his early model was that of IBM, and especially of the Watsons there. This is, presumably, why he was so successful in his initial negotiations with the company - his hero-worship must have come across, and who could have resisted such a fan (not to say groupie)! But, even then, and especially later, his business practices were almost the exact reverse of those of the Watsons. The latter may have fallen foul of Anti-Trust, but Gates almost seemed to seek it out and thrived on it; and on almost every other dubious business practice open to a business leader. The need to win seems to colour his whole life.<query> who was the first successful business leader</query> Although it is claimed that he can put aside personal issues to take rational decisions, it seems as if he personalises many of the competitive conflicts he enters into; and even views them as life and death battles, which they almost as often turn out to be for his victims! He is renowned for using public platforms to bad-mouth his competitors and their products. In particular, though, he ignores all the niceties (and sometimes the legal necessities) of business to business negotiations. Classically, he started negotiations with Ray Noorda - CEO at Novell - about to purchase his company. They jointly signed a non-disclosure agreement (as have other Gates victims), and Noorda obtained approval for the deal from his board. Gates decided against it, but did not bother to tell Noorda this or return the documents which had been exchanged[lxxxiv].<query> who is the ceo of novell</query> Noorda only found out from the reports given by Microsoft to the trade press. In that case, Gates only fanned an already deadly rivalry. In the somewhat similar case of Stac Electronics, whose disk compression software Microsoft wanted, the outcome was rather different. After that deal fell though, Microsoft's subsequent DOS 6.0 included a disk compression product so similar to Stac's that it won a $120 million patent infringement suit[lxxxv]. Others in a similar position could not afford to sue! But Gates is lucky that his opponents are not so ruthless, or so personally involved. When Noorda, who was so incensed by his treatment that he almost started a crusade, tried to bring the rest of the industry together to work against Microsoft, they couldn't agree - and Gates' tactics of divide and rule once more worked.<query> what was microsoft's disk compression software</query> The Trial I will cover this subject only briefly, since this is a book about management practice not jurisprudence. If you want more, I would suggest you read John Heilemann's blow by blow account 'Pride Before the Fall'[lxxxvi] or the chapters in David Bank's excellent book [lxxxvii] ""Breaking Windows"". For the record, despite its protestations that it was still a small company and its rather incompetent performance at the trial, by that time Microsoft's legal department had grown from the three people it had in 1985 to more than 300 employees[lxxxviii] - 150 of them attorneys - almost as many as IBM had at its peak! Despite this plethora of lawyers, and the previous consent decree, the trial heard Microsoft had failed to adopt any official anti-trust compliance policy or a comprehensive anti-trust training regime for its employees.<query> how many lawyers were in the microsoft trial</query> His fall from grace came when he thought he had lost the Internet to Netscape. He then violated every rule of crisis management; letting its natural belligerence destroy its image; turning Gates from a 'golden geek' into a robber-baron.. Perhaps the most blatant example of the resulting business practices, and the one which finally provoked the attention of the Justice Department, was his treatment of Netscape. As Gary Rivlin reported[lxxxix], ""For public consumption Microsoft's goal was trumping Netscape feature by feature. [ but] Privately the aim of the Internet Explorer was to teach Netscape a lesson…Microsoft employees vowed that they wouldn't be satisfied until the price of Netscape's stock had fallen by at least two thirds"". It showed its hand most blatantly in the case of Compaq, which had been selling PCs pre-loaded with Netscape Navigator; and which insisted on sticking to this deal.<query> what was the goal of netscape</query> Again according to Gary Rivlin[xc], the unwise response from Microsoft was to threaten its longtime partner with a 'Notice to Terminate License Agreement' which essentially said that Compaq was free to choose whatever browser it wanted - but if it chose Navigator over Explorer it would lose the right to sell Windows! Even Compaq, despite its size as the then brand leader, was forced to give way. Microsoft's key strategy was simply to give Explorer away for free. Microsoft's Paul Maritz told a meeting of industry executives ""We are going to cut off their air supply…Everything they're selling, we're going to give away free…How long can they survive…""[xci]. Thereafter it successfully targeted exclusive deals with the five largest Internet access providers and offered others offers they couldn't refuse! The trial which eventually destroyed Microsoft's image came about, though, because Gates blatantly ignored the terms of the consent decree which he had agreed in 1995; which had laid down the terms of his competition with Netscape.<query> why did microsoft give away explorer</query> He believed he had written a massive loophole into it - letting Microsoft add new features - such that he could do almost what he wanted. However the Department of Justice (DOJ) took a different tack. Under it the company was explicitly prohibited from requiring OEMs to license any other product as a condition of using Windows. But Microsoft's marketing plans showed that was exactly what it intended to do with Internet Explorer version 4! Microsoft's response to the subsequent DOJ investigations was adversarial in the extreme, possibly pushing the DOJ into the full-scale anti-trust action, and the damage to its image started to grow. Indeed, throughout the whole case it - and especially Gates - was aggressive. When Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held a hearing in his office, but was fifteen minutes later due to being on the floor of the Senate casting his vote, Gates is reported[xcii] to have said ""Well, given that we are starting 15 minutes late and I'm only going to have 45 minutes now, we should get right to it."" Things went down hill from there!<query> what was microsoft's response to the doj investigation</query> In particular, when the two sides met for what might normally be expected to be an attempt to thrash out a settlement, according to John Heilemann[xciii] Gates held forth for two hours, lecturing the DOJ. He asked no questions of it and his answers took the form of 'prolonged soliloquies'. Not surprisingly there was never a meeting of minds; at a time when a settlement was possible - in the previous 1995 settlement it had already conceded most of the issues - and, though in its arrogance it did not realise it, was needed by Microsoft. Even in retrospect, its failure to settle was not just serious but inexplicable. Possibly Bill Gates arrogance played too big a role or possibly its attorneys failed to understand the magnitude of the case about to face them. Where they though it might focus narrowly on the breaches of the consent decree, in fact it would focus on one large question: whether the company had 'maintained its operating-system monopoly through exclusionary and predatory conduct' - a much wider and more dangerous question.<query> why did microsoft fail to settle</query> When the case came, however, probably the most damaging encounter took place outside if the courtroom -in August 1998 in one of Microsoft's own conference rooms. Bill Gates faced David Boies, the DOJ's special trial counsel, who was expecting Gates to be as smart, tough and articulate as he had been at previous meetings. Instead Gates was petulant, dour and cantankerous. The videotaped interrogation went on for twenty hours over three days. Boies was delighted with the results, for they showed Gates and Microsoft in the worst possible light. On key questions Gates either turned amnesiac, and tried to play word games. Thus, as described by [xciv] John Heilemann, one key exchange was about an email message at the top of which was the phrase 'Importance: High'. In answer to various questions Gates steadfastly denied that he had typed this - and indeed it was written by the software - but, as Boies was able to establish, this was an attribute set by the user (Gates).<query> who was bill gates in the microsoft case</query> So, the conclusion of the exchange was Boies saying ""…so you're the one who set the high designation of importance, right sir?"", forcing Gates to reply ""It appears I did that."" The rest of the twenty hours was much the same; a disaster for Gates. On reason for this poor, and unprepared, performance may have been that Gates, steeped in the law from the time he was an infant, appeared to think he had a greater mastery of law than his lawyers; and they seemed to concur with this view. Another explanation might have been that they assumed that the video would never be shown; since Gates would be going into the witness box himself. Unfortunately, after this performance, nobody dared let him go near any cross-examination! However, this left the prosecution to play selected, very damaging, excerpts from the videotapes.<query> why did bill gates fail to answer questions</query> Whatever the reason, Gary Kildall ruled himself out of the main race - though (after threatening legal action over the similarities between DOS and CP/M) he was later allowed to put CP/M on the new IBM machine; but foolishly chose to price it at $240 per copy against Microsoft's $40[xii] - and that was the final nail in its coffin! So, in one of the lucky chances which have so characterized Gates' career, Kildall handed the resulting billions to Bill Gates - who by then no longer felt he had to live up to his previous agreement with Kildall! Gross Failures…whilst few individuals, or organizations, achieve outstanding results, the one way you can be sure to beat the odds, in terms of achieving anything other than an average performance, is tofail; badly!<query> who bought cpm</query> These did not just fatally damage Microsoft's case, but they did even more damage to its public image! Although Gates did not go into the witness box, he did - that December - give a press conference; at which, compounding the problem, he accused Boies of being out to 'destroy Microsoft' - which phrase led the reports in all the papers next day, suggesting he was paranoid and self-pitying (scarcely the image he and his PR advisors might have wanted to achieve!). Some of the other Microsoft defence evidence was not much better; giving the distinct impression that it had been tampered with - again hardly ideal for its image. The outcome was the worst possible. The case against Microsoft was deemed proved. The remedy was even worse - Judge Jackson decreed that Microsoft should be broken up.<query> what was the outcome of the microsoft case</query> Though this particular remedy was set aside - influenced by a more business 'friendly' Bush jr. administration - on appeal in 2001, the proven verdict was maintained; leaving its future damagingly open to speculation! Privateer The real importance of Bill Gates is not, though, that he successfully flaunts society's values. It is that, in many ways, he encapsulates the new values society, or at least US society, believed was acceptable - and even desirable - from its new entrepreneurial business leaders. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, 'market-driven society' had won the argument - in the famous words of Francis Fukayama, it was 'The End of History'. In the 1990s market values became all that mattered, and the only values which really counted were those of money.<query> what was the importance of bill gates</query> How you got that money did not matter, and, where the CIA no less was believed to be involved in drug running, even borderline criminal activities could be justified on the back of the money being made. The best historical analogy was perhaps the licences given by first Queen Elizabeth to the privateers; not least to Sir Francis Drake, who was just as admired in his time and since as has been Bill Gates. Apart from their licences, these privateers were little different to pirates. They attacked merchant ships - albeit Spanish ones - not for their own country but for their victim's treasure. Like Gates, their one aim in life was to destroy the competition - no matter how this was done. It was war, but on a very commercial footing - as its Microsoft's! Piracy and Other Business Methods…it may be generally observed that the most money is to be made by sailing closest to the wind.<query> who was the first privateer</query> Indeed, the largest fortunes may be accumulated by those, such as Bill Gates, who are most determined to push out the boundaries of what may (just) be legal. This is even more true of those - such as in the arms and intelligence industries - who are willing to undertake those things even governments themselves are nervous about! The borderline between the acceptable and the illegal is usually only explored in terms of the ethical issues involved. The question which needs to be asked, of society rather than Microsoft, is this what we want. The relatively gentle exploration of new horizons which the Watsons undertook, has been ruthlessly replaced by the plundering - by a whole generation of managers not just Bill Gates - of the resulting spoils. With a personality which might be more favourably compared to Blackbeard than Drake, is Gates the leader who may eventually bring the whole post-1989 system crashing down?<query> who is bill gates</query> [i] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press [ii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p129 [iii] Heilemann, John, (2001) Pride Before the Fall, HarperCollins, p54 [iv] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p8 [v] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p96 [vi] Chposky, James & Ted Leonsis (!989) Blue Magic: The People, the Power and the Politics Behind the IBM Personal Computer, Grafton Books, p40 [vii] Lowe, Janet, (1998)<query> who wrote the plot to get bill gates</query> Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p11 [viii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p32 [ix] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p29 [x] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p33 [xi] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p33 [xii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p35 [xiii] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p34 [xiv] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone p23 [xv] Rivlin, Gary, (1999)<query> who wrote the plot to get bill gates</query> The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p27 [xvi] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p27 [xvii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p22 [xviii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p25 [xix] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p60 [xx] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p61 [xxi] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p69 [xxii] Stross, Randall E, 1996)<query> who is bill gates's wife</query> The Microsoft Way, Little Brown, p36 [xxiii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p77 [xxiv] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p85 [xxv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p28 [xxvi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p10 [xxvii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p98 [xxviii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p102 [xxix] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxx] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxxi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p44 [xxxii] Stross, Randall E, 1996)<query> who is bill gates barbarians</query> The Microsoft Way, Little Brown, p56 [xxxiii] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p48 [xxxiv] Edstrom, Jennifer & Marlin Eller, (1998), Barbarians Led by Bill Gates, Henry Holt, p48 [xxxv] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p54 [xxxvi] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p54 [xxxvii] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p100 [xxxviii] Lowe, Janet, (1998) Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p65 [xxxix] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p206 [xl] Rivlin, Gary, (1999)<query> who is bill gates speaking for</query> The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p208 [xli] Dearlove, Des, (1999), Business the Bill Gates Way, Capstone, p132 [xlii] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p54 [xliii] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p55 [xliv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p96 [xlv] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p131 [xlvi] Bank, David, (2001), Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft, The Free Press, p132 [xlvii] Lowe, Janet, (1998)<query> who wrote breaking windows</query> In particular, the organizations which stand out from the crowd are typically those which have taken such bad decisions that they have in effect destroyed themselves. Much is suggested about how to succeed in business, but little is said about avoiding failure. Even so, Bill Gates, opportunistic bright guy that he was (and still is), had an almost non-existent organisation, with a very limited track record; and did not even have an operating system to offer! It has been suggested by some commentators that the key to this was that John Opel sat on the same board, of the charity United Way, as Bill Gates' mother, Mary. I personally doubt this, since Opel wasn't involved at the time, but Janet Lowe[xiii] insists this was the case. The regular face to face meetings with his mother must, though, have later made it even more difficult for John Akers, who had then taken over his predecessor's place on the board, to act against a supplier (her son, Bill Gates) - and in the process against IBM's own philosophies - in any really aggressive way.<query> who was bill gates mother</query> Bill Gates Speaks, Wiley, p119 [xlviii] Rivlin, Gary, (1999) The Plot to Get Bill Gates, Quartet Books, p21 [xlix] Gates, Bill (1995), The Road Ahead, Penguin, p91 [l] Neff, Thomas J. & James M.

Based on my own experiences of similar situations within IBM, my own suspicions are that the IBM personnel found Bill Gates a useful front man for taking actions which the IBM system would not have let them take. Had they tried to write their own software it would have been bogged down in quality control procedures for years. Had they tried to buy outright some software, and it then became IBM's, it too would have been bogged down with IBM's Business Practices staff and in risk-control procedures for months. Bill Gates took all these problems away from the group; and, precisely because his was such a small organisation, the IBMers probably thought they still had some degree of control (though, of course as events were to prove, they didn't!).<query> why did bill gates take over ibm</query> I myself from time to time used similar outsiders to front work for IBM which would have been impossible to get through the system otherwise. Regulating Bootleggers…organizations often come to depend upon 'illicit' development operations in order to bypass their bureaucracies. Such approaches may be essential to future development. They can, though, subvert the whole organisation - so senior management needs to develop the special skills (in particular those of balancing freedom against risk control) to manage such operations. Apart from the work of Peters & Waterman, which refers to 'skunkworks' management, theory pays little heed to those who operate on the borderline of legitimacy (and none to control over their potential subversion). In terms of why Armonk did not see the risks, Paul Carroll (in Big Blues) says, of the key meeting of the Management Committee (MC) which approved the setting up of the group, that""...the Management Committee continued to see this review as just one of the numerous proposals that came in front of them each week.<query> who regulates bootleggers</query> Lowe and his team thought of the PC as a home computer and continually referred to it that way, so it hardly seemed as if would be of any interest to IBM's corporate customers."" In other words the MC approved ahome computer not the Personal (Business) Computer it later became. He goes on to say of the other key issue; ""There was little discussion about whether using outsider's parts would mean IBM couldn't control the direction the market would take, the way that IBM controlled everything about the lucrative mainframe market. But nobody in the room had the foresight to realise how important the personal-computer market would become or how little control IBM would, in fact, have. The MC members worried more about the possibility that outsiders would be allowed to sell the PC, because IBM wasn't sure it could make then live up to its blue-suited white-shirted standard.<query> why was the pc a personal computer</query> Even that concern didn't really heat up until later."" As it was a home computer, aimed at a small market (and with only a small investment at stake) did it matter? You bet it did, but - given the information in front of them - there was no way they could have known that. A much better question is why didn't they do something later when theydid find out what was happening? Des Dearlove[xiv] says of the deal ""The effect was like introducing a fat and sleepy buffalo to a piranha."" Internal Weak Signals…the problem of detecting weak signals in the external environment is well understood - though no solution is generally available - but that of recognizing the equivalent signs of impending 'fractures'within the organization is not. These may represent an even greater a threat to the future of the organisation; and the solutionis available - all it needs is a management information system which reports on them!<query> why did the piranha react to the weak signal</query> Most management theory does not, however, even allow for such internal fractures. At the time Microsoft's business was based on porting mainframe languages to minis, and its main product was its BASIC interpreter for these. This was reportedly[xv] developed (setting another precedent) on the back of hundred of hours of illicit time spent on the Harvard computer when he was studying there (and against the rules allowing an outsider to work on the same commercial development, for which - again demonstrating his unbelievable luck - he only got a slap on the wrist). So when Bill Gates and his team were also visited by IBM - they assumed that this was what they wanted. Unlike Digital Research, they happily signed the non-disclosure agreement and, uncharacteristically, were very deferential to IBM - a posture they adopted with IBM (but nobody else!) until the deal finally fell apart!<query> what was microsoft's main product</query> So it is reasonable to imagine Akers agonizing over how he could 'do the dirty' on Mrs. Gates' nice young son when, paradoxically, Bill Gates himself would never had any qualms had the situation been reversed!. Indeed, when they first met him the IBM team thought Gates was the office boy (an image he seemingly cultivated since his 'adversaries, to their disadvantage, then consistently underrated him) - Perhaps setting the precedent for the business practices to come, the BASIC work had already been the subject of a lawsuit about ownership with Pertec; though in that case, for once, the arbitrator admonished Pertec for its business practices not Microsoft. Opportunism…Bill Gates' greatest skill is that of applied opportunism; of quickly recognizing potential opportunities and then getting behind them.<query> who is bill gates</query> That, rather than his place in the pantheon of business gods - or devils - is what really earns him his place in this tome about business giants. In view of his very different values, though, some go further to describe him as the 'anti-Christ' to IBM's previous 'snow white'. Indeed, whatever view you take, you cannot avoid the fact that the early history of Bill Gates and his company was inextricably intertwined with that of IBM (or at least of its PC Group); and maybe, if you want to pursue the Anti-Christ theory, you can argue that he has been the beneficiary of a great deal more luck than any mortal has a right to expect. On the other hand, Gates has always had a very clear vision of what is important to an IT supplier.<query> who is bill gates</query> This ability is in part a gift, but it can be developed by opening the mind to the whole range of opportunities. Dignified by the umbrella term of 'creative management', a range of techniques have been developed by some academics. The IBM team were, in the meantime, reporting that despite his lack of resources (but presumably impressed by his deferential demeanor) they felt they could work with Bill Gates; an off-the-cuff judgement which later came back to haunt IBM. QDOS Thus, when the IBM team returned, they offered Gates the BASIC software business but - much more important - they mentioned, almost as an aside, their need for an operating system. Gates, the supreme opportunist, jumped at the chance to bid; where, to give him his due, most of us would not have had the courage to do so.<query> what is the role of creative management</query> There are a number of semi-apocryphal stories about what happened next. One suggests that Gates was already friendly with Rod Brook, the owner of Seattle Computer Products, who was developing a 16-bit operating system called SCP-DOS (Seattle Computer Products Disk Operating System) or, according to a number of other sources, called QDOS (rather ominously standing for 'Quick and Dirty Operating System'!).Whatever the real story, Bill Gates was left to find an operating system and eventually located one. The most important aspect though, according to Paul Carroll, was that Bill Gates' contact in IBM - Jack Sams - told him topurchase the operating system; again as I probably would have done, to get round IBM's internal systems. Gates paid $75,000 for it - $25,000 initially, for the licensing rights, and then $50,000 for the exclusive rights, in his own name - and nobody can deny that, in terms of the billions he subsequently made from it, it was a bargain!<query> what was bill gates operating system called</query> Soon afterwards (again according to Carroll) Sams, who - perhaps understandably - may have wanted Microsoft to remain viable so his own operation within IBM would not fail, persuaded Gates to take a tougher negotiating line with IBM. It was a lesson Gates learned well, and later followed to IBM's great disadvantage! Arguably, as you follow the story of Microsoft, Bill Gates strength was indeed that he was an outstanding negotiator; and it was a skill first taught him (at least in part) by IBM. He was also lucky. QDOS borrowed somewhat from CP/M, and just before the launch of the PC DR threatened a lawsuit on this basis; but IBM bought them off by also putting DP/M on the machine alongside (IBM) DOS (Disk Operating System) as Microsoft's product was then called (the version which later powered the clones was, for obvious reasons named rather differently - as PC DOS).<query> who was bill gates</query> It was DR's poor judgment, and again Microsoft's good luck, that they botched their whole marketing effort (and priced their system at six times as much as DOS). Confident Negotiation…probably the main 'skill' needed in negotiation is confidence. On the one hand, if you have nothing to lose or, on the other, if your experience leads you to expect a good outcome, your confidence will usually make you an excellent negotiator. The nervous negotiator, who is uncertain of the outcome, will almost always lose. Negotiating skills are, rather questionably, usually the preserve of specialist - very commercial - trainers. He was even luckier that IBM did not insist on an exclusive licence; though, paradoxically, Gates had been - in 1976 - one of the first to vehemently object to the pirating of software; claiming that his BASIC had taken up $40,000 of machine time - which may have been true, but he failed to mention it was from Harvard that he illicitly obtained this[xvi]!<query> what is the main skill in negotiation</query> At this time, courtesy of IBM, he was set free to sell this new software to other hardware suppliers. At the time, when IBM held such a dominant position, this probably did not seem relevant; but later, when the position was reversed and the clones dominated the market - using Microsoft's PC DOS - it clearly was seen to be a historic mistake. Thus, though he was only paid a one-off fee of $200,000 by IBM for its own PC DOS, he was almost literally given a licence to print money with his own version; MS DOS. IBM Loses Its Bottle Above all, though, it was Bill Gates' abilities as a negotiator, and the lack of ability of his IBM opposites which determined the day. According to Paul Carroll, at the first set of key meetings, in 1985, when IBM might have re-negotiated the deal - since IBM was still in an immensely strong position (and indeed was eventually offered - in an unusually conciliatory gesture in 1986 - a 10 per cent share of Microsoft, which it turned down!)<query> who was bill gates</query> - it was William Lowe (who had by then taken over, again, from Don Estridge) and his boss Mike Armstrong who were indecisive. Carroll goes on to say ""That indecisive quality can leave IBM vulnerable - as it did repeatedly in Lowe's and Armstrong's dealings with Gates."" Whatever the reason, at this critical time, and over the next few years, Bill Gates regularly negotiated himself out of having to make a less favorable deal with IBM - and even from having to face competition from it. For a decade, somehow or other, he kept IBM off his back - and set the basis for his billions! Incredibly, considering the constant in-fighting, the relationship lasted until 1992; though over most of that time Gates already had a team planning what Microsoft needed to do if IBM ditched it!<query> who was bill gates boss</query> Indecision…almost worse than taking the wrong decision may be not taking the decision at all! Management theory does insist, perhaps at times with rather too much machismo, that decisions must be taken promptly. Windows The crucial development was, however, that of the Windows - which was eventually launched as genuinely workable operating system (as version 3.0) in 1990. Although IBM apparently conceived the idea of its equivalent OS/2 in 1984, Gates - as always ahead of the game - reportedly had become interested when, at the November 1982 COMDEX, he had seen the VisionOn graphical interface launched by VisiCorp; then one of his main rivals in applications software, with revenues on the back of its VisiCalc spreadsheet which were then double those of Microsoft. In typical style, Gates reacted to this - as described by Edstrom & Eller, the latter having been a key member of Gates' programming team for thirteen years [xvii] - like ""Saul on the road to Damascus "".<query> when was windows os introduced</query> He saw both the threat, VisiCorp could set the standard (as it seemingly had already decided to do), and the matching opportunity. He immediately set his best programmers working on it, two years before IBM even started to consider anything like it; and eight years before Microsoft's finally successful version appeared; so the other lesson perhaps is that even Microsoft's best programmer's can't always deliver next week! In another typical move he had purchased a $15,000 Xerox PARC Star system; so his team could 'reverse engineer' (copy the workings of its software, though not the exact code - which is the part that is always copyrighted) its most innovative features - especially its use of icons, which is now such a familiar part of Windows. Again using whatever (even dubious) means at his disposal, Gates eventually hired Scott McGregor, who had written Xerox's windowing system [xviii], to lead his own graphics group.<query> who wrote windows graphics</query> With Dan McCabe duplicating VisiOn's windows and Rao Ramala working on the icons, a (demonstration) prototype was ready by April 1983; though this only demonstrated the concepts and was a long way (eight years) from a working system. Even so, the Interface Manager Group of just ten people - whose only strategic advice from Gates (once more typically) had been to 'squash VisiOn' - was in chaos until new management, including McGregor, was put in place. The key to success, however, was not writing the software but persuading the software and hardware vendors (playing each off against the other) to write the drivers which allowed their products to interface with Windows - an investment by them which has since become a barrier-to-entry protecting Microsoft's monopoly position.<query> when was vision created</query> According to Martin Eller[xix], Gates was fixated upon IBM; even though it was the only major PC vendor not to support Windows. His near obsession was, though, perhaps understandable when its support had been so important in the creation of his fortune - and, at that time, it was of course still the giant which dominated the industry (whose ire it was not wise to earn!). But meeting IBM's needs frequently seemed to get in the way of the rather chaotic development of Windows. Thus, when IBM announced an, ultimately unsuccessful, upgrade to DOS but also a competitor to Windows - TopView - Gates wanted to support this; despite the fact that meant support for DOS, which the developers were having difficulty maintaining in the new operating system. Eller makes a quite fundamental observation, though an inevitably biased one, when he suggests[xx] that at the time ""Gates had never been involved in any of the architectural design of Windows, nor had he ever been personally involved in writing such large amounts of code…and he seemed totally oblivious to the fact that every feature change radically screwed up Window's stability, testing, and ship date."" In fact even now, despite more than 25 years working in software Gates has held just one patent.<query> who was the first pc to support windows</query> In his excellent book[i], which gives the most comprehensive coverage of events surrounding Microsoft's changes of direction at the end of the 1990s, David Bank nicely summarized a lengthier email from him in 1997 as: ""…one idea: as hardware gets cheap software gets valuable. Software is the bottleneck. Computer software will always be in shortage because what people want to do with computers is always increasing. "" Luck… teaching sales managers in IBM, I used to emphasize the four factors they would need to achieve an outstanding performance. In descending order of importance, they were: Achievable Objectives - the first was by far the most important. It was simply the ability to persuade those setting the objectives - be they higher management or the stockholders - to expect less than might be actually achievable.<query> why is software the bottleneck</query> The result was a lack of strategic direction for a year. When, in 1984, the delivery date still was a year over the horizon, and the size of the software meant that it would only run on a PC with a hard disc, McGregor left and with him went much of what technical leadership there might have been. Even when, in November 1985, Windows 1.0 did finally make it out of the door, it didn't support either Mac or TopView applications and, once more according to Eller[xxi], its DOS compatibility was a joke. He summarizes the position as ""In short, the product was essentially useless""; so maybe that is why Microsoft seemed to want to forget about it! Gates left only a three man team in place keep the project alive in theory, but it had clearly gone to the bottom of his priority list where (surprisingly in view of its phenomenal success later) it remained until the early 1990s; when the sale of a million copies of Windows 3.0 eventually awakened Gates to its potential.<query> when did windows 1.0 come out</query> In the meantime Gates once more focused on IBM, and OS/2. The main problem emerging from the joint work with the IBM development team was not just the difference in dress and culture but, much more importantly in programming standards. Having worked with the IBM PC development labs at Hursley myself, I am aware of just how much of their time is spent on debugging their programmes - and, in particular testing them - so that when they go out the door they are near perfect. Microsoft's programmers, pushed by Bill Gates, were more concerned that their work went out fast; and testing (or even thorough debugging) was a luxury they would happily dispense with. Indeed, Gates is obsessed with the perishability of software, as reported by Randall Stross' book[xxii] 'The Microsoft Way', he has said "" …there's not a single line of code here today that will have value, say, in four or five years time"".<query> who is bill gates</query> That is why their later discovery of beta-testing, whereby the testing could be passed to customers who would even pay for the privilege, came as a nicely cost-effective development. But, needless to say, their cavalier attitude did not impress the IBM programmers; even though the resulting speed of development was why IBM was so keen to use them to get round its own bureaucratic delays! IBM needed them, and they still needed IBM's money and prestige. Beta Testing…using customers to test, and even develop, new 'products' is very productive for the vendor, and well received by the customers (as it leads to an interactive dialogue). In one variation on the approach, the Japanese vendors launch many incrementally new products and wait to see which is the fittest - and survives.<query> why did ibm use beta testing</query> This was very different to the traditional Western approach which looks for radical developments; though the high-tech industries have now widely adopted beta-testing (though perhaps without really understanding what is involved!). Because IBM wouldn't build support for Windows into the TopView software they were also developing, the Microsoft team were looking for alternatives. The one they found was a TopView clone called Mondrian, developed (yet again) by a small company, Dynamical Systems Research (DSR) owned by a group of Princeton Physicists. Microsoft bought the company for a stock swap (not even cash) valued at around $1.5 million[xxiii]. In the process, in a typical move, gates also 'bought' Nathan Myhrvold, who became his most influential technical advisor in the early 1990s. Eventually, in 1986, to the delight of Gates IBM did indicate that it might support a Windows type interface; though it still did not go as far as doing anything about it!<query> who made mondrian</query> As a result of Gates betting his future on OS/2, by the end of 1986 Windows was seen - within Microsoft at least - as an orphaned bit of code, though the application developers continued to use it as a useful model so they would be ready to port their work to OS/2 (which Gates, perhaps rather foolishly, thoughtwould be compatible) when it came. By then, however, the IBM OS/2 team had now been split, to include IBM's Hursley lab in the UK - with whom, by coincidence, I was working at the time. As described by the various commentators, the eight-strong Microsoft team may have been ensconced at Hursley for three weeks in the luxurious mansion there - annoying the local IBMers by playing Frisbee on the extensive lawns - but IBM's own dozens-strong programming team was (perhaps more significantly) holed up on the top floor of an ordinary office building in Basingstoke new town - ten miles a way.<query> where was microsoft os2 developed</query> Indeed, IBM and Microsoft did eventually launch, jointly, OS/2 Presentation Manager - two years after the IBM statement - at the end of October 1988. Significantly, signaling his enthusiastic support at the time for OS/2 rather than Windows, Gates is quoted[xxiv] as saying ""This is the milestone that changes the rules for everybody…OS/2 Presentation Manager will be the environment for office computing in the 1990s."" I guess that this is one time IBM now wish his proud boasthad come true! His partner, Steve Ballmer, was even more explicit ""This is it, after this we're not going to have any more Windows. It's all OS/2"" Indeed, the next version of Windows, version 2.01 which was full of bugs (and hence rapidly led to 2.02 and 2.03), was specifically launched only to support the new Compaq 386.<query> when was os/2 presentation manager released</query> A couple of programmers were left to maintain it, but that was to have been - with it becoming nothing more than an interim development platform for OS/2 - to all intents and purposes the end of Windows. Steve Ballmer, a friend of Gates at Harvard, was persuaded to join Microsoft in 1980 - to, in effect, thereafter to become one of its founding fathers. Even so, he was seen as a weak strategist for a technology company. According to David Bank[xxv]at the time gates told his aides that that there was little chance Ballmer would ever become CEO. Of course, at the end of the 21990s Ballmer did eventually displace Gates as CEO; though who actually controls Microsoft is still an open question! In particular, at the earlier time, though, he very effectively reorganized Microsoft to get the right people in the right places.<query> who was steve ballmer</query> In addition, forced to become a reluctant head of sales and marketing, he was the closest of the founding partners to the needs of its customers. Skunkworks Unfortunately for IBM, Dave Weise - who couldn’t cope with working alongside IBM - argued his way back to the effectively defunct group. But this left him, with time on his hands, to pursue a pet project. The key to the future, for all operating systems, was to be able to run in 'protected mode' such that each application program could run alongside another but protected from it; its own code would not be corrupted by any others running on the machine. Around this time, Ballmer had wanted to buy Scroll Screen Tracer (SST) - a debugger developed by Murray Sargent, a brilliant physics professor from the University of Arizona - for use on its DOS work.<query> who created sst</query> Sargent, who was then on contract at Microsoft was persuaded to sell it, and spend the summer of ! 988 training Microsoft staff to use it and moving its own debugger into protect mode. This was when Weise met him, at a Microsoft party. Without any approval from Microsoft management, in the most celebrated form of skunkworks, the two of them - using Sargent's debugger - spent the next two weeks seeing how much of Windows they could hack into protect mode. In such unpredictable ways are corporate futures changed; without this one-man mission, the PC world would still be colored (OS/2) blue! Skunkworks…many of the most important breakthroughs come from unexpected sources. As already suggested, the key management ability is that of recognizing their importance. Again, those running creative management courses teach helpful techniques.<query> who invented the skunkworks</query> The result was that, at the August 1988 planning meeting, Weise (having wisely, forgive the pun, brought Ballmer in on the secret a few days earlier) sprang on Gates - along with the then fifteen man Windows team - not just the news that he had cracked the protect mode problem but actually demonstrated a working version of Windows using it. Even though he still thought OS/2 was the going to be the industry leader, Gates gave the go ahead for the new Windows project, and the legendary version 3.0 was on its way to launch twenty-one months later. Product Champions…the most important breakthroughs are often achieved by individuals who are so involved, indeed obsessed, that they will overcome all the odds - sometimes even going as far as to subvert the organization - to gain success for their 'baby'.<query> what year did windows os 2 come out</query> If you beat low objectives (as, for a long time, Bill Gates did) you are a hero. If you fail, even marginally (as IBM very publicly did), to meet higher objectives you are on the way out! Luck - thereafter, the next factor is luck. This is the one which is written very large on Bill Gates' CV. There is no easy way you can create this. Hard Work - on the other hand, the saying that by hard work (and Bill Gates has dedicated almost every waking minute to his own project) you can create your luck (or more accurately the opportunities for some luck to come your way) holds some truth. Ability - only comes last! Most performance management systems, however, assume the reverse, indeed that ability, coupled with hard work, is almost all that is needed!<query> what is the difference between hard work and ability</query> Academics recognize the role, which is akin to that of 'change agent' in the wider environment, but have few suggestions as to how they can be encouraged; and traditional managers find a host of ways to actively discourage them! Even though Gates thought it wouldn't harm the relationship with IBM, when the word finally leaked out to IBM, who quite reasonably thought they had eradicated Windows, all hell broke loose and they told Microsoft to kill the project. Accordingly, at the 1989 COMDEX Gates stood up and promised that - after the planned 1991 release of Windows 3.0 - Microsoft would cease development of it. ; leaving it for the low end of the market and OS/2 being the main PC operating system. Windows 3.0 The reality was that, launched in 1990, Windows 3.0 was an instant success; selling two million copies in the first six months.<query> when did windows ibm stop developing</query> As a result it took on a life of its own; and because of the work done by Microsoft's application groups - who were using it to test the move to OS/2 - their offerings (Word, Excel etc.) also walked over their competitors! Not least, Ashton-Tate's 'Word-Perfect' word processing package, which - despite all Gates' efforts to promote his own Word (whose disastrously bug-laden first version was still remembered) - had been the brand leader through the 1980s, moved too slowly and was soon overtaken; as eventually was Lotus in the spreadsheet market. Indeed, by 1998, the 'Office' desktop applications grossed more than $6 billion, compared with rather less than $5 billion for the Windows desktop platform[xxvi] . They had become the two best selling software products in history.<query> what year did word become the best selling software</query> In just two years Microsoft's stock-market value grew by 305% - reaching more than $20 billion by the end of 1991. According to Eller[xxvii], those inside Microsoft knew just what a fluke it had been, but the media - fed a diet by the publicists that insisted Microsoft was Gates - couldn't see it that way; and the legend was ratcheted up a notch. In turn his competitors believed it was a strategy born of his devilish cunning; all along he had planned to ditch OS/2 and give his own applications programs an unfair advantage. I tend to believe, like Eller, that - at this stage at least - it was an incredibly profitable cock-up not a well-judged conspiracy! It was only when Gates saw Windows 3.0 sell a million copies that he finally accepted - even then seeming to still want to follow IBM - it was a strategic product.<query> what was microsoft's strategy</query> Cultural Incompatibility…alliances often demand that shared taskforces are formed. If the two cultures are as different as those of Microsoft and IBM the result may be counter-productive. Again, those running creative management courses address this problem. Windows NT…mind you, even then he almost immediately switched his allegiance to Windows NT, which was rumored[xxviii] to have been started as a means of attracting one of DECs VMS architects; who wanted to continue working on mini-computer software. Based on the DEC architecture, unlike the mainstream Windows which still used large amounts of Intel 16-bit assembler code, NT was to be built from the ground up; to run on the whole range of machines (from PCs to mainframes, thus starting to deliver Gates' dream of global domination).<query> what was the purpose of windows nt</query> In the new range of products, his own PC based Windows was (once more) to be maintained, OS/2 was still to be the major new operating system for the PC, and NT (the key product) was to be the portable (between machines) platform of the future. Unfortunately, when - at the beginning of 1991 - the NT team presented their work, IBM noticed that it was all windows and no OS/2; and the long engagement was over before any children had been delivered. The loss of OS/2 also damaged Microsoft's networking and language developments, which had been based on it, throwing away several years of development work in the process. Even though it accounted for only a tenth of Microsoft's 'platform' business, Windows NT was to be Bill Gates' passport to the even more profitable business to be had from larger systems.<query> what was the nt operating system</query> Accordingly, throughout the 1990s, he threw resources at it. The first version, Windows NT, contained 6 million lines of code and needed a team of 250 developers at a cost of $150 million[xxix]. For later versions, the team expanded to more than 5,000 staff, producing nearly 30 million lines of code. Bill Gates eventually abandoned the 'Cairo' version, which was supposed to become his 'Windows Everywhere' and take over the world, to produce yet another version (which eventually was launched as Windows 2000) that was incompatible with the mainstream platform - but Bill Gates[xxx] proudly announced that it had cost of more than $3 billion, more than the Boeing 747 cost to develop! James Allchin, who was the head of the project, had been, once more in a typical manner, been recruited by Gates when he was considering buying Banyan, a specialist in networking, but realized that it was better - and far cheaper - to simply hire Allchin away from them instead!<query> what was the cost of the first windows</query> In a comment redolent of the IBM 360 gamble, he said ""We're obviously betting the company on it"". At the time, in terms of Microsoft's vicious internal politics, he was fighting for supremacy over the mainstream windows which he thought was a 'nice toy'[xxxi].Time will tell if his hype was well founded, and it really is as profitable an investment as the 360 was; or more like Concorde, a price paid for the developers ego! The Concorde Effect…the best developers are those who are product champions, dedicated to - indeed almost obsessed by - their new 'product'. With their blinkers on, they are however the worst people to decide on its value in the market-place! Windows 95…the new stand-alone version, which was eventually called Windows 95, was to be a very different affair.<query> what is the concorde effect</query> As it was now to become the star product, the development team grew until it eventually ran to over 500 names, matching the size of project team IBM had been wont to deploy. Making it a 32-bit system once more created major delays, though this time they had a sound alternative (Windows 3.0, with 140 million users) already in the field. It also signed up to strict protocols on debugging and testing; though this was the point at which they discovered the real magic of beta-testing, Some 400,000 users (adding up to something like 75 million hours of testing) signed up to use the code (laden, as it turned out, with 6,000 bugs) in advance of first delivery and paid $30 a copy for the privilege! In fact, 1990 seems to have been something of a turning point for Microsoft as a whole.<query> when did microsoft start beta testing</query> Before that time its history had depended on a great deal of luck; as indeed was the unexpected success of Windows 3.0. Thereafter it turned itself into a much more conventional organization; much less dependent on chance for its success. In particular, Nathan Myhrvold was put in charge of its research and development work[xxxii]. As we saw above, he recruited literally hundreds of new developers to work on Windows, in order to rectify Microsoft's previous tendency to ship bug-laden first and second versions - only getting the product right the third time around!. Macintosh At that earlier time, Microsoft had also been working with Apple to port its applications to the new GUI (Graphical User Interface) machine, the Macintosh. In view of the obvious conflict of interest, Gates had been forced to create a 'Chinese Wall' between the two sets of developers; though it proved to be a very leaky one - not least because its senior managers, who knew all about the Mac, straddled the two (and were captivated by the Mac).<query> who was the first person to work on windows</query> The day the Mac was introduced, in January 1984, Gates reportedly told MacGregor to go out and buy one so it could be reverse-engineered. He did not see any conflict of interest, and did not apparently[xxxiii] want this to squash Apple, as he had done VisiCorp. It is claimed that he merely wanted to ensure the Microsoft applications running on the IBM PC were brought into line with those on the Apple Mac; for efficiencies sake It is a nice story, but it would be the first, and last, time Gates indulged in such niceties! In any case, apparently without understanding how the Mac system worked [xxxiv] (a strange lack given his passion for software), and in particular that it was incompatible with their own windows code, Gates told the Windows team to also incorporate the Mac features; which caused yet another massive delay - said to be more than seven months.<query> when was the first mac introduced</query> L'Etat C'est Moi On the other hand, unlike IBM which has long been a corporate identity, Microsoftis Bill Gates; it would be nothing without him - and that stark contrast with IBM is also part of the fascination of his role in the context of this book. So for the record, William Henry Gates III was born in 1995 - in Seattle where he still lives - to wealthy parents; with a socially-prominent, and doting, mother whose interventions played a significant role in many of the key developments in his life. He reportedly[ii] talked to her as many as three times a day even through later life. Unlike almost all other commentators, however, John Heilemann[iii] suggests it was his lawyer father who was most influential; and indeed being steeped in the law may have later caused his son to later behave unwisely at Microsoft's anti-trust trial.<query> where was bill gates born</query> Billionaire Bill Gates, as we all now know, went on to become the world's wealthiest individual - becoming a billionaire as early as 1986 when he was just 31 years old - and in the process created between 1,000 and 3,000 employee millionaire employees (depending upon which estimate you take), though that number may have significantly diminished after the dot.com crash which cut Wall Street's valuation of Microsoft by a third. He has been, with a degree of self-interest, generous to his key employees in this way. Even so, Microsoft's management style has been described as Darwinian - survival of the fittest[xxxv]. Bill Gates seems to thrive on conflict, as much within Microsoft as outside it. He is, again according to Janet Lowe[xxxvi], ""…known for being confrontational, rude and condescending ""; characteristics which did not help his case (or his image in the media) when he appeared before the judge in the Anti-Trust trial at the end of the 1990s.<query> who is bill gates</query> In particular, he has a low tolerance for those whose intellect he does not respect. When he throws a tantrum his favourite phrase seems to be "" …this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of…""[xxxvii] At such times he is hyperactive and literally screams at his staff, before quietening down and rocking rhythmically back and forth in his chair! On the other hand, as (reported by Janet Lowe again[xxxviii]) one developer said "" …you have to understand we're all adolescents. And proud of it. "" But he (perhaps helped by his billions) is still seen as a charismatic leader who inspires his dedicated workers. Much of the good news is, though, hype put out by his spin doctors. Thus, in particular, his widely reported donations to charity are often rather less than they may seem.<query> who is the developer</query> In total up to 1997, Gates gave away just $70 million; less than a third of one per cent of his total net worth. Microsoft's subsequent 1997 claim that it had donated $73.2 million in cash and software was revealed to be 85% software - valued at retail prices (even though the cost to Microsoft was probably less than one per cent of this) - and even this (given to a school or library) was best seen as promotional support rather than charity[xxxix]! A number of the subsequent 'donations' are also best viewed as promotional activities. Gates' excuse is that ""I don't have time to figure out what charities make sense""[xl] - and presumably he also doesn't have time either to appoint an adviser who would have the time! Underdog For years, during its battle with IBM, Microsoft was seen as the underdog It even carried this underdog image with it when it became the market leader.<query> how much money did bill gates give away</query> It was only at the end of 1997, having already been in court since 1996, when the US Justice Department's prosecution case really started, that its reputation turned around and it became the target for the near hate which now sometimes envelops it! The fact that it had brazenly defied the previous order placed on it in 1995, requiring it to offer its Internet Explorer separately, clearly did not help. More important, for its competitors, Microsoft is determined to keep proprietary control - under the law - of all IT standards, and has done so far more effectively than IBM ever did. Its methods have sometimes been, however, questionable. For example, having signed up to adopt the Sun Microsystems Java language for use on its Windows and NT systems, the version it actually released was not compatible with the original standard; and once more fought it out in the courts.<query> what is microsoft's proprietary control</query> It has also been criticised for releasing substandard products just to get to market before its competitors; but, according to Des Dearlove[xli], Gates has said that ""…getting to market with a good or OK product first is better than getting there second with a great product ."" Control of Standards…if you can gain control of the standards which operate in a market, and especially if you can achieve something of a monopoly as IBM once did and more recently Microsoft has done, you can shape the demands of that market to favor your own offerings. Academics, especially economists, encounter difficulty in dealing with markets which experience imperfect competition - as most do! Strategy As - in the later 1990s - the markets for operating systems moved into new areas, especially in consumer goods such as digital televisions, Bill Gates promoted his 'vision' of 'Widows Everywhere': with compatibility across the whole range of devices.<query> who said that it is better to get to market first or second</query> This was to be developed by Allchin's group working on Windows NT, by then the ultimately aborted Cairo project which finally become Windows 2000. This represented, in Bill Gates' eyes, thefuture: allowing him to enter the profitable large systems market. Ranged against them, however, were Silverberg's team working on Chicago; which in turn would become Windows 95 - consolidating Microsoft's hold on its core business with end-users. Silverberg was very market-oriented, giving users what they wanted; and his staff, largely made up of graduate recruits, saw themselves as 'pirates' dedicated to creating 'cool' new features[xlii]! Earlier in Microsoft's history this competition between groups might have proved productive, in much the same way that IBM at its peak funded competing developments and then chose the best of them.<query> who developed windows 97</query> But, in the 1990s as it matured to become a large bureaucracy, the splits between the two groups started to cause major tensions within the company. They didn't communicate well with each other, not least because Silverberg saw the job of the NT team as being 'to kill Windows 95'[xliii]; which was, indeed, its hidden agenda! In the later 1990s an even more crucial split appeared. This was between the Windows developers in general, who were at the heart of the company, and those who wanted to respond to the new - rapidly growing - demands of the Internet. Bill Gates was, of course, amongst the former; since his 'Windows' had spent most of the last decade building the 'lock' on its users that he saw as the source of Microsoft's massive profits.<query> who was the microsoft company</query> The users were happy using it and - most important - they found it very difficult to give it up and switch to something else! It was the 'hard-drug' of the software industry, where persuading its users to undergo any 'cold turkey' was an almost impossible task for Microsoft's competitors. Accordingly, over the years - despite the ease of maintenance which would be the result - Microsoft had never simplified its code and had added on extra new features to strength its lock on users. Cold Turkey…if you can build in a high level of migration costs, so that customers think it is not worth the costs of changing to achieve marginally better results and they are not too annoyed by poor service, your 'product' can build a very stable set of customers; and, if you are the brand leader, build towards something very like a monopoly!<query> why was microsoft never a cold turkey</query> Unfortunately, the Internet was essentially simple; and was, as such, seen by Bill Gates as a major threat to his security blanket of 'lock-ins'. But the Internet was already attracting the attention of the many 'independent' software providers on whom Microsoft relied for writing the applications which its customers used. It was at this stage, therefore, the Bill Gates finally got interested - especially in Netscape which was rapidly becoming everyone's favourite. Unable to buy that company, his usual solution, Bill Gates response inevitably was to order his developers to reverse-engineer it and then add unique features an content to build the lock-in again. The hidden effect, which ultimately became more important, was that, for once, Bill Gates was forced to embrace open-standards; those of the Internet.<query> why was bill gates forced to embrace open standards</query> Of course, it would also extend them, to - as its competitors claimed - 'engulf and devour' them! Even the Windows desktop was to become a web-page. It also highlighted another major split within Microsoft. By then its developers had begun to feel that their new ideas were being pushed aside in the name of 'strategy'. Bill Gates had been demanding ever tighter lock-ins - to push users towards its own applications. Bosworth voiced these frustrations [xliv]: ""Before 1996 the entrepreneurs ruled Microsoft…[it] was filled with people who had to compete against entrenched winners and won…The organization was built for that"". But, he added, the new bureaucratic limitations - demanded by the 'profit maximization' model Bill Gates had created - was stifling all that and demoralizing staff.<query> what was the purpose of the microsoft organization before 1996</query> As a teenager, though, encouraged by his mother and possibly living up to the example of his great-grandfather who had founded Seattle's National City Bank, he undoubtedly showed a precocious intellect at an early age - not least in mathematics - and even as a teenager was seen as a bona fide computer nerd (or geek, which he still is!). Perhaps not unexpectedly, one of his heroes as a teenager was Holden Caulfield from 'Catcher in the Rye'[iv], passages from which he was still reciting to girlfriends when he was well into his thirties[v]; though in later life his great hero seems to have become Leonardo da Vinci - perhaps because he identifies with him! On the other hand, he was a most unusual teenager - even for the money obsessed West Coast - in that he was - above all - preoccupied (indeed obsessed) with turning a profit on whatever he touched.<query> who was holden caulfield</query> The main argument, however, then focused on whether Microsoft should be developing a (separate) new Internet platform or integrating it with Windows. Unfortunately the legal arguments in the anti-trust case meant that Bill Gates had state that integration was a necessity; and the die was cast! Up until then the board of Microsoft had always deferred to Gates, for he had been the company's single focus of control. Now, as they saw it, this 'focus' was also becoming its single point of failure. Windows 2000 was losing its battle against complexity and other products were being delayed. According to David Bank[xlv], based on the email evidence uncovered in the anti-trust trial, Gates was losing control! In 1998, therefore, he handed business responsibility to Ballmer - who he had once said would never become CEO - and then in January finally allowed him to have the full title of CEO.<query> who was the ceo of microsoft</query> Again according to David Banks[xlvi], Bill Gates' explanation for moving to 'Chief Software Architect', that he wanted to spend more time with its product groups, caused alarm amongst these! They feared he would disrupt their efforts, where the previous advice from their functional management had been to keep Gates as far away from their work as possible. In the event, Ballmer proved just as centrist as gates, demanding to be the focus of decision-making one every issue; a major problem where he, like Bill Gates before him, managed by controlling the detail rather than by setting strategic objectives. In any case, Bill Gates - now supposedly thinking two to five years ahead - is still the one real central focus in Microsoft, and is still seen as its 'brand image' (albeit an increasingly unattractive one) to the outside world.<query> why did bill gates move to microsoft</query> The main problem for Microsoft may now be that it has lost its intense focus on Windows, which had driven it for the previous decade. As set out for employees in 2001, Ballmer stated that there were to beseven key businesses (including .NET, Office, Server Software, MSN),two priorities for staff (keeping customers and delivering the new platform) andthree things the company must do well (meet priorities, cut costs and focus on its people). Microsoft was starting to look like IBM in the worst days of John Aker's rule! Visionary? Gates' spin-doctors plug him as being a great visionary. But he didn't invent DOS, it was IBM who brought him to that, and his most successful product Windows, the key elements of which were derived from the technological breakthroughs of others, has succeeded despite his decades long attempts to kill it.<query> what was the main problem with microsoft</query> In many respects, therefore, Gates is best characterized as the luckiest man alive or at least the world's most successful opportunist. Thus, displaying a peculiar, and continuing, blindness over the future of IT communications, he missed the development of LANs (Local Area Networks) and lost software leadership there to Novell (something that, despite his public bad-mouthing of the Novell software) he once thought was his greatest mistake [xlvii] and has twice tried to buy [xlviii]. Indeed, despite all the hype, he has relatively poor strategic vision. Although his much hyped 1995 book about the future (which talked more about his new house and his passion for encryption than what faces the rest of us as a result of his machinations), mentioned the Internet (which some of the commentators have mistakenly said it didn't), Gates predicted that this would only be a minor part of the overall 'superhighway', which was the focus of his attention at the time; ""The growth of the Internet over the past few years suggests that highway applications will quickly become extremely popular and justify large investments…It's a long way from being the highway, but it's the closest approximation we have today, and will evolve into the highway ""[xlix].<query> who is the luckiest man alive</query> How embarrassingly short-sighted can a futurist be! In fact, as usual for Gates, his interest in the whole field of electronic networking had been stimulated by the arrival of what he saw as a major new competitor: AOL. The result was the development by Microsoft, from early 1993 onwards, of an on-line system, Marvel, which soon became Microsoft Network and then just MSN. It was a closed system, however, mimicking AOL, rather than peer-to-peer as the Internet was - and as Myhrvold was wisely recommending at the time. AOL At this point I will indulge in another diversion, into that part of the field of Business-To-Consumer (B2C), and especially Consumer-To-Consumer (C2C) networking, now dominated by AOL.<query> what was microsoft network</query> It is a diversion, in the context of this book, since it is now not directly relevant to Microsoft, or even IBM which - apart from its disastrous adventure with Prodigy (its own AOL contender) - has steadfastly stayed with Business-To-Business (B2B) markets. It is important, however, because in the longer term, albeit perhaps not for a decade or more, C2C networking is likely to become the biggest market of all. Microsoft, despite its dependence on the mistakes of others combined with a generous measure of luck for its success, still follows many of the traditional approaches to business. On the other hand, AOL seems to have lived life in the fast-lane dependentonly on luck! What is more, it seems to have succeeded despite a vision in which its main business has often been seen by it as merely peripheral!<query> why is microsoft a good business</query> In much the same way that the precursor of IBM was first created by Charles R Flint, the precursor of AOL was initially set up as early as 1978 by another 'serial' company builder Bill Von Meister; as a home information utility, 'The Source'. Unlike Flint, though, most of Von Meister's efforts failed spectacularly; and 'The Source', running out of funds, was soon sold to Reader's Digest; and eventually ended up as part of Compuserve (which was, in turn bought by AOL - thus closing the circle!). Only AOL achieved significant success; and then not for another decade, long after Von Meister left - to die penniless. Foreshadowing the interest in the entertainment business which - despite the reality of its customer base and revenue streams - has since seemed to represent the most important focus of AOL's own vision of its future, Von Meister's next venture was the 'Home Music Store' selling popular music down the line.<query> who created aol</query> Like Napster, two decades later, this was predictably destroyed by opposition from the record industry! Von Meister then set out on another new 'entertainment' venture. This time it was in on-line video games which - spurred on by sales of millions of Atari consoles - were the flavor of the month in the early 1980s. Launched at the 1883 CES show in Las Vegas, the new venture was called the control Video Corporation, CVC, and was funded by - amongst others - Dan Case. The product, the 'Gameline Master Module' which attached to the Atari (though Atari had refused to support the operations), was initially a hit with the venture capitalists. Perhaps more important, it brought in, as a consultant and then full-time employee, Steve Case. He was Dan's brother and was to dominate the later development of AOL, as had Thomas Watson Sr. that of IBM.<query> who was steve case</query> Unlike others in the industry - who (like Bill Gates) started life as IT specialists - but like Thomas Watson Sr., Steve Case's career to that point to that point had been in marketing; though classically, for the age of mass marketing, as an assistant brand manager at P&G and then manager of new product development at Pizza Hut. Surprisingly, considering his marketing background and unlike Gates, Case has adopted a low key image. He has said[l] ""In my case it really is about believing that there is work to be done to build a medium that we can be proud of…It's not about so-called power; or visibility or stature. These are things I don't particularly enjoy."" He has been described by The Washington Post[li] as ""…the technocrat politician more than the entrepreneur.."" which then added ""This approach…may be betters suited to long terms success"" and significantly, in contrast with Bill Gates, ""He integrates a lot of views when he's making decisions…"" Another reporter at The Washington Post[lii] categorized him as ""…half nerd and half marketing guru…He's enough of a nerd to be really into online services but he has all the marketing skills to understand how to make it work."" Von Meister's bad luck held once more.<query> who is steve case</query> The bottom dropped out of the video games market almost as soon as CVC had been launched, he was on his way out once more and Bob Cross was brought in to turn the company around. But salvation was no easy task for, in 1984, it was said that ""the company had no clear product, no apparent market, no real money[liii]"". The real salvation, perhaps, was the investment by Jim Kismet who had previously made his fortune by opening a chain of singles bars. It also relied on a deal with the Bell South telephone company. The new product, a modem for home use, once more failed to ignite interest; and Bell South, joining the lengthening line of punters who had lost their shirts backing Von Meister, lost its money. To avoid bankruptcy, the business was transferred to a new company with yet more new founders, Quantum Computer Services, which was to provide private (Q-Link) online services for Commodore customers.<query> who started cvc</query> His mother's first defining influence, though, came when the 'Mother's Club' at his private school set up a fund to provide the students with time on a large (General Electric owned) mainframe computer and then at CCC (Computer Center Corporation) where the 'Mother's Club arranged for them to use its new DEC computer after hours - in return for searching out programming errors in its software. Spurred on by the irresistible opportunity this presented to him, he was soon became one of the early hackers invading various other computer systems; demonstrating early a disdain of the law which seems to have stayed with him - if the Anti-Trust proceedings are anything to go by. Recently, though, the only penalties he seems to have racked up are the speeding tickets he has earned around Seattle in his range of fast cars!<query> who was the first computer hacker</query> Thiswas, a decade or more down the line, to become AOL. But growth in revenue was slow. By 1986 there were only 10,000 customers and revenue in 1987 was only $8.6 million; although for once they did make a small profit! Indeed, as Commodore's fortunes declined, they needed to find a new platform. It couldn't be IBM, since that was locked into Prodigy - and indeed was relaunching this. So, the choice was Apple, which was to receive a 10 per cent royalty on sales. Although this brought larger numbers of customers, Quantum eventually felt itself too cramped by the marketing constraints it involved. In the resulting break-up Apple also joined the lengthening line of partners which had lost money - in this case including $2.5 million to buy back the rights to its own logo!<query> what year did apple break up</query> This, in 1989, was the point at which the name of the service (but not the holding company) was finally changed to America Online, which offered much the same private online services; though now across the whole market - including IBM users. By 1991, however, AOL was to ready to become a 'legitimate' business. Previously it had lived almost as a serial 'scam'; persuading a range of individuals and organizations to bet their shirts, and then lose them, on very borderline ventures. Indeed, Kara Swisher, in her very comprehensive book about AOL (AOL.COM[liv]), summarizes this feature very 'positively' as "" …throughout its volatile history, one of AOL's greatest strengths - and also the subject of later criticism - has been its ability to fund itself through a variety of innovative and controversial methods…[for] its business operations never threw off enough cash to cover the costs of its growth."" Scam Entrepreneurs…small start-ups are often more dependent on selling their ideas to investors than to consumers.<query> when did aol become legit</query> They typically need 'venture capitalists' to fund them. Some of these, such as Flint at IBM and Markula at Apple, are legitimate - even if they do at times sail close to edge of legality. Some, such as Von Meister, can be more reminiscent of Mel Brooks' 'Producers'. Whichever the type, however, there is always considerable risk involved, the odds are against such small ventures, entrepreneurs - along with potential investors - should think long and hard before they jump! Even that part of management thinking devoted to SME's (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) tends to optimistically ignore the risk of failure. Now, though, it had something genuinely worthwhile to promote. Indeed, even Compuserve, which had been growing its consumer online service for hobbyist computer users - based on its interactive computer bulletin boards (though its main strength became its financial and computer data) - and which had bought The Source (with its 53,000 members) to add to the half a million of its own, now wanted to get hold of Quantum's 110,000 members - and eventually offered $50 million for the company.<query> what type of venture is a sme</query> But that was below the $60 million which its management saw as the very minimum it was worth, so the sale fell through - and, of course, AOL later returned the favor by actually buying Compuserve! Its name, changed to AOL for the company as well as the offering, was now becoming known but sales growth was still slow. Even so, in 1992, it went public on NASDAQ; only to suffer the attentions of Paul G Allen, cofounder of Microsoft, who steadily acquired its stock. Even Bill Gates made an approach; though his characteristic opening gambit, ""I can buy 20 per cent of you or I can buy all of you. Or I can go into this business myself and bury you [lv]"", virtually killed that deal on the spot; though Case only won the subsequent vote on AOL's board by one vote[lvi]!<query> who bought aol</query> The company possibly was now, in 1993, worth around $400 million - having multiplied its value sevenfold in two years. Bill Gates, in turn, went on to try and bury it with MSN; but, for once, signally failed to do so. Having beaten of Gates, and having come to terms with Allen, Steve Case was at last allowed to emerge and make a marketing advantage out of AOL's flexibility: ""From the early days, we recognized that communications - a combination of chat and e-mail - were critical building blocks…So our bias was on creating tools, empowering people, and letting then use them in any way they thought appropriate - sort of 'Let a thousand flowers bloom'[lvii] "". AOL had, at long last, settled on the formula which was to make it a power in the land.<query> who is steve case</query> Unlike the 'seriousness' of Compuserve and the IBM dominated 'family' atmosphere of Prodigy, the freedom of expression offered by the AOL service attracted subscribers; even if much of the chat was sex-oriented (and that posed major problems with the industry regulators later in the 1990s when something like half its business was still sexually oriented!). In addition, using the icon-based approach it had been forced to develop when it served Apple, it was easy to use (and install, taking only five minutes for this) - and, unlike Compuserve and Prodigy, it now could be fully used on either Apple or Windows. Newsweek[lviii] summed it up as ""By hosting hundreds of chat rooms, sponsoring the most popular instant messaging service on the globe and giving granny an e-mail address she'd never figure out how to change, AOL kept its audience and saw growth accelerated by the Network Effect (the more people who sign up, the more valuable the service)."" It is this latter aspect, in particular, which we believe will be the key to future value.<query> why is aol so popular</query> Owning Members…C2C (Consumer-To-Consumer) networking will eventually become just about the most profitable ecommerce market. Ownership of its members will then be the key to value for portals; and the financial markets are already in effect putting a value per member - at the peak of the dot.com boom it was something like $15,000 for each AOL members. As yet, though ecommerce is a strange new land for business academics! The product was now right, and the newly hired Jan Brandt took the most important, albeit also the riskiest, marketing step AOL ever made. She started the carpet-bombing of America with free AOL software disks - ultimately sending out 250 million of these! This was the ultimate in sampling, giving the millions of recipients immediate access; with free hours of usage and waiver of the first month's fee.<query> how much does aol cost per member</query> It was a classic marketing success; in that 10 per cent of those receiving the disks used them for a free trial of the service. Over the years from 1992 to 1996, the 25 million free trials then turned into 5 million members[lix]. Sampling…the most effective device for persuading potential new customers to but your product or service is to let them sample it. Otherwise the significant step they have to make is to buy the 'product' just to see if it works for them. This trial offer is just important in B2B and services. Indeed, despite the popular image of samples plopping onto the doormat, internet services (which can, without costs to themselves or their prospective customers, offer a free trial - limited by a time-out) are likely to become the most important users of this approach.<query> why is it important to offer a free trial</query> Management theorists tend to lump sampling together with other forms of promotion, most of which are usually price discounts in one form or another, which misses the point. Even though the response generated problems with AOL's service response times, and clogged its lines, by mid 1994 AOL had a million members on line. Just as important, as Kara Swisher reports, ""…its share price was red hot, and most of its purchases [of companies taken over] could be made with its stock as currency. Over the next year, AOL would use the stock market to literally print money - in the form of AOL shares."" In one of its first moves subsequently, it bought 'Bookline' to be its browser - only later to be replaced by the much bigger acquisition of Netscape.<query> when did aol buy netscape</query> It also acquired Advanced Network & Services Inc (ANS) to build its communications network. It also started to build a stable of companies creating interactive material, buying stakes in them or entering into joint ventures; as new content creation became its vehicle for brand building. To service its new 'channels, deliberately modeled on television to make it look like a media company, it also created its own 'in-house content studio', and had potential providers make pitches to it as producers did to the film studios! The first winners included 'Motley Fool', the irreverent - but very successful - financial site. Once again running short of funds, it worked its magic with another public offering; and at the end of 1995 its fortunes seemed to be set fair. But the world was moving to the internet and AOL's 'closed network' offering started to look stale - until, seemingly against all the odds (but eliminating Justice Department problems), Bill Gates offered to put the AOL registration icon on the Windows desktop; albeit not as prominently displayed as that of MSN.<query> what was the first aol</query> Early on, however, he was caught by the CCC security officers when his hacking activities crashed the mainframe. He has said that he then ""…swore off computers for a year and a half…I tried to be normal[vi]"", though Janet Lowe[vii] (perhaps with more conviction) insists it was his mother who, worried that this distraction might cause him to fail his schoolwork, ordered him to stop! She might have had a point, because he later dropped out of Harvard to start the company which afterwards became Microsoft. We now move on therefore, to the part of his life story which was enmeshed with that of IBM. IBM Bearing True Gifts Clearly the most important turning point, in this context, was the initial decision which ultimately made Bill Gates a billionaire; personally worth, on paper at least, something like $6 billion by the beginning of the 1990s.<query> what year did bill gates become microsoft</query> At the same time, however, AOL brought in Netscape to replace 'Bookline' as its own browser; though it didn't buy it until 1999 - for $4.2 billion -- by which time its deal with Microsoft had become much less important. By 1996, AOL was worth $6.5 billion[lx], up 15,000 per cent in just two years, and had - once more against the odds - beaten Microsoft in the online wars of the previous year. But it was becoming the victim of 'churn' amongst its customer base, losing members almost as fast as it signed up new ones (at a cost to it of $50 each); and this also fatally damaged the AOL accounting practice of amortizing its customer acquisition costs over two years. Even worse, its competitors, including the new ISPs which were entering the business, were starting to offer unlimited usage deals - where AOL made its money from the hourly usage charges!<query> when did aol buy netscape</query> It was forced to introduce a flat rate offering; at $19.95 for 20 hours use. The panic amongst its investors knocked nearly 70 per cent off its value. The situation was compounded by the technical problems AOL was experiencing in servicing its more than 6 million customers. This was highlighted by a widely publicized system outage, for almost 19 hours, in August 1996; and AOL was forced to invest $250 million (eventually more than $350 million) in its communications network. Worse was to come. AOL lost $353.7 million in the first quarter of 1987, when it had to write off its deferred subscriber acquisition costs. In 1997, to improve profitability, AOL started to charge its content partners for access to its now very valuable customer base. In 1998 it, at long last, acquired Compuserve; whose AOL copycat, Wow, had failed miserably.<query> when did aol start charging for content</query> In any case, despite its 2.6 million members, Compuserve was regularly making losses. The deal was, once more, innovative - with AOL 'buying' Compuserve from WorldCom as a swap for AOL's ANS subsidiary (which, though successful, had been getting in the way of AOL's relations with the other communications networks). AOL even got $185 million in cash! Its stock jumped 600 per cent in 1998 alone! The icing on the cake came when at the end of the 1990s, its miraculously escalating stock market valuation - having multiplied almost a thousandfold over the decade - allowed it to buy Time-Warner. This was one of the great media corporations, with - as IBM once had - a successful track-record stretching back almost a century. This was a fairy tale come true, though whether the Time-Warner kiss will turn the frog, that AOL still is, into anything else is yet to be seen.<query> who bought compuserve</query> In some respects it smacked of the 'water' that IBM's Flint had added to his deals, though Wall Street - lusting for the dot.com boom to come and very aware of the 30 million members (ten times as many as MSN) AOL now had - was a very willing partner. In many respects it took AOL back to its roots, as an online entertainment provider which it had long wanted to be; and possibly took its attention away from the online customer services base which was its real strength. More worryingly for the resulting conglomerate, it produced a corporation which was straddling two very different markets - entertainment through cable and communications through the internet - which were proving impossible to merge. Pyramid Builders…we can all sneer at the housewives who foolishly get caught up in chain letter scams. Yet the most foolish of all are those in the financial markets who are happy to accept the inflated values set by those who create pyramids of businesses where paper profits are hidden by the takeovers themselves at one extreme and by the Byzantine mazes of globalized accounting systems at the other - all nicely wrapped up in creatively accounted packages! Management educators do not warn their students that the biggest confidence tricks of all can be played on the financial markets.<query> what is the aol pyramid</query> I have also talked a great deal about customers at IBM and Microsoft, but AOL really us different because these are ongoing members; and they are much more important to it than its staff. Even so, it is worth recording that its culture is supposedly[lxi] a mix of Apple's enthusiasm and dedication to its product with Microsoft's work ethic and competitive nature. In particular, though, its dress code was definitelyvery casual! The Internet Proper Reverting to the Microsoft story, in 1993 - after his rebuff by AOL - Bill Gates started to build its own online offering to compete with it, which eventually became MSN. It, of course, had the major advantage of being given pride of place on the Windows desktop; though its use of the Windows folder approach made it much less approachable than AOL's.<query> what is aol's culture</query> Furthermore, its launch slipped as did that of Windows 95, to which it was tied and by which it was also overshadowed. In the event it managed to sign up nearly 200,000 users in the first two weeks, but then - lacking heavyweight promotional support - its growth stagnated; whilst AOL at the same time was bringing 250,000 new users every month. In the event, MSN reportedly[lxii] lost $500 million in two years. It was not until the end of 1995 that Microsoft ported MSN to the Web. Indeed, Bill Gateswas very late recognizing the true potential offered by the Internet. The story[lxiii] is that suddenly in May 1995, having spent 10 hours browsing the Internet and finding almost no Microsoft standard file formats (but lots of those from competitors), he issued a directive which said ""I want every product plan to try and go overboard on Internet features "".<query> when did microsoft start using the internet</query> Previously he had, instead, focused his teams solely on the 'grand convergence of television and computers'[lxiv] (the then media mogul's, incorrect, cable/megastream view of the future of the 'Superhighway'), even though he already had a team developing a technically similar (low-bandwidth) Remote Information Protocol (RIP) for the 'home' - code-named Homer, it was to control all the devices (from lights and heating to washing machines and television) around the home. Gates killed off this advanced consumer technology group's (low-bandwidth) work in 1992, apparently without ever realizing the coming importance of the Internet! Long Range Forecasting…the most powerful technique for exploring the future over the longer term, beyond ten years ahead in general (but possibly less than half that in the very fast-moving high-tech industries) is scenario forecasting. A number of management textbooks, including my own, cover the subject of scenarios in some depth.<query> what is the most powerful technique for exploring the future over the long term?</query> The end result, where his directive[lxv] also said ""…with a major goal to get OEMs shipping our browser preinstalled"", was all the legal trouble he brought on himself when he later tried (otherwise successfully) to recover his position by destroying Netscape, which had actually implemented something like RIP. At the time, his own browser, a separate application called Explorer 1.0, was licensed from Spyglass (the company which had bought Marc Andreessen's previous Mosaic browser code - the precursor to his later Netscape) and Microsoft then sold copies of it for $50 - even though it had often been given away free as shareware over the Internet. Just, but only just, living up to its name Windows 95 was launched at the end of 1995. The outcome of Gates' Internet oversight was, however, that Windows 95 was overshadowed at the 1995 COMDEX by the new kid on the block: Netscape!<query> what year was windows 95 released</query> Once again, the next version - Windows 98 - was to be the interim product just supporting new hardware; leading the way now to NT. To add something to persuade users to switch, they added the Explorer 4.0 shell to the core product[lxvi] - finally inviting the unwelcome attention of the Justice Department! Tensions The split between its two incompatible systems continued into the 21st century, however, with Windows 98 moving on to become Windows Millennium Edition, still with much of its code written in Intel's 16-bit assembler[lxvii] with Windows 2000 still based on DEC architecture! XML…Up until the late 1990s, Bill Gates had insisted that Windows was the main, indeed almost the only, offering which really mattered. At that time, however, the advent of the Internet posed a genuine - if very unwelcome - challenge to Windows domination; even within Microsoft itself.<query> what was the first version of windows</query> Even as late as 1997, Bill Gates lacerated the Java team for failing to protect Windows, stating:""Why don't you just give up your [stock] options and join the Peace Corps?…Haven't you ever heard of Windows? Windows is what this company is about![lxviii]"". On the other hand, the development group under Bosworth - who had (unusually) negotiated a guarantee of independence from Bill Gates - was responding to the new demand for XML; a cross-platform development from the basic HTML language which made it possible for software applications to work together regardless of the underlying platform. On the basis of some stealth, not least by covertly persuading IBM and Oracle to also support it and boosted by the collapse of a competitive development within Microsoft, in June 2000 it made XML the focus of its Internet offering.<query> what was the xml language</query> More important, for the tale of IBM's woes, it handed the control of the PC operating system to him! As we have seen elsewhere, there was a degree of inevitability that PC group would look outside for an operating system. As a small IBU, with very limited resources (to match its limited targets) and impossible timescales, it had to 'buy-in' these things; and in any case the philosophy (enshrined in the then popular management theory as 'make or buy') was very much in vogue with IBM senior management. PC group was to be congratulated by them, at the time, for their initiative; and many other parts of IBM were encouraged to follow suit - though, fortunately perhaps, few did. What may seem less understandable, even with hindsight, is why IBM chose Microsoft.<query> why did ibm choose microsoft</query> In Bill Gates' eyes it was still 'disruptive technology, which threatened the existing products in the market and especially his own 'lock-ins', but by then there was no alternative. Microsoft, for once, would have to win by being the best! Yet again, thousands of its developers were drafted in for this work. When this happened, the best developers - who liked the freedom of working in small groups - again left the company. Where previously they would have been welcomed to the band of its independent software providers, however, they were this time treated with hostility and had to work for its competitors - hardly a wise move by Microsoft! Disruptive Technologies…this is now one of the 'in-phrases' amongst business leaders, but all it means is that radical new technologies can threaten the sitting tenants in markets, so they - and you - must keep looking over your shoulder to see what is coming up on you.<query> what is disruptive technology</query> If you know about it, with your position in the market and the resources this generates, you can usually counter it. .NET…Having finally got Windows 2000 out of the door, Microsoft started in its significant change in direction. The new offering was not to be the software in a package, as Windows was, but software provided as an Internet-based service. After considerable soul-searching, and after Bill Gates had finally been persuaded not to include 'Windows' in the name, the title Dot. Net (.NET) was chosen. The pressure to once more integrate everything to do with the Internet under this banner returned. Bill Gates saw .NET, using XML, once more as proprietary: ""What we do is take standards and drive forward.[lxix]"": in exactly the same way that he captured the market for PC operating systems.<query> what is.net</query> He, once more, invited in the usual range of 'partners', but made it clear that Microsoft would keep the high volume parts of the service to itself. Bill Gates was back, with a vengeance, in a form of business he really understood. This time, though, these 'partners' and their customers proved less willing to put their trust in Gates; and this weakened the whole package! The Battle for the Internet As yet, AOL is winning the war for 'content'. On the other hand, the battle for the future if Internet operating systems is far from decided. On the one hand there is .NET, now Microsoft's chosen offering: with which (using Microsoft's better development tools) it is easy to create web services, use XML and write in most languages - but can only run on one operating system (once more Windows!).<query> what is the battle for the internet</query> On the other, there is Java, backed by Microsoft's competitors - in particular IBM and Sun - in order to break the Windows monopoly; favored by IT managers in that it is reliable, secure and scalable, and can run on any popular operating system. But it has fewer development tools and is the only language available, even in the cases of J2EE - Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition - which dominates the corporate market. Although Java was developed as a proprietary modular system (made up of 'beans' which could be combined in various ways to make the most efficient code)by Sun, it is now effectively an open standard where, in line with his core (lock-in) philosophy. Bill Gates tightly controls the proprietary .NET. According to The Economist[lxx] ""Even if Microsoft is contained by antitrust remedies .NET is likely to reign supreme on the PC - but not in the entire consumer market.<query> what is java language</query> Java has taken hold in set-top boxes and mobile phones which now outnumber PCs. In the corporate market J2EE will probably dominate. But many small businesses will choose .NET because they want to spend less and still find it simple to get everything from one vendor."" Perhaps the real difference is that, for the first time in more than a decade, in these new markets Microsoft is not the clear leader - let alone dominant - instead it is the challenger. It will once more have to play the role of David against Goliath, which was so popular with its customers in the 1980s but which will now be - after the revelations of the anti-trust trial - much less believable! Despite its history with Windows, it is even demanding open standards - which is a much more believable demand coming from its new competitor, Linux, which is not just open standard but is freeware!<query> what is the difference between java and linux</query> Linux In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Microsoft's competitors - most notable and, belatedly, IBM - had tried to promote Unix as their preferred competitive operating system. Unfortunately, each of the suppliers had produced systems which were incompatible with each other. Bill Gates could justifiably claim, even with the split caused by Windows NT, that for most of the market his offering offered a true single standard. All that changed when Linux, a variant on Unix, was developed as 'freeware'. Thus, anyone could take the core (kernel) of the operating system without charge, as long as they accepted its standards. Soon, thousands of programmers around the world were adding their own code to make Linux ever more powerful. Most important, as 'open-source' (written in code which was publicly available), everyone could inspect and test the code; so bugs were soon found and rectified by this worldwide army of volunteers.<query> what was the first operating system to be developed as a freeware</query> As a result - with a publicly standardized kernel - it was more stable than Windows; keeping Linux servers running for literally hundreds of days without crashing and needing restarting, as Windows regularly did. It turned Bill Gates dream of future 'lock-ins' into a nightmare. It was a platform which really did work effectively across the range of computers - from the smallest handhelds to the largest mainframes - and it was of course free! Linux is now coming of age as Windows did in the early 1990s, and IBM - for one - planned to spend $1 billion on it in 2001. Financial Performance In comparison with the corporate, but caring, IBM machine built by the Watsons, Microsoft is the archetypal product of one man. Depending on your views of modern society, you either love (or at least admire) Gates, as the symbol of American free-markets at their productive (and meanest), best or you hate him, as the symbol of what is worst in a market-based society which knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.<query> what is the linux platform</query> Indeed, as David Bank[lxxi] says, ""High volume, not high prices, is the key to Microsoft's high profits. No other product matches software when it comes to what is called operating leverage. The first copy of a new software program may cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. The second costs pennies."" Ever since it got its 'product' right with the launch of Windows 3.0 in 1990, Microsoft has put in a record setting financial performance: The year by year pattern clearly shows the boost to sales coming from the launch of the new products in mid-1990 and (Windows 1995) in mid 1995.<query> when did microsoft release windows</query> The launch of Windows 98, and the other new products, in mid 1998 did not seem to have the same dramatic effect on sales; but maybe that was not the objective, for these launches gave an even bigger boost to profits! Having survived the Anti-Trust trial largely unscathed, in mid-2002 Bill Gates took a gamble that his monopoly would enable him to bring in even more profits, by changing Microsoft's licensing from a volume-based approach to a subscription-based one which gives him far more control over his customers. Despite the volume of protests, and possible customer moves to competitors, he may get away with this - and rake in even more profit. Thus, David Roberts, chief executive of the blue-chip user group The Infrastructure Forum, says[lxxii] ""Members believe it will take four years to move, and…There's still a huge question about whether the functionality is available with anything else"": remember the phrase 'Nobody got fired for buying IBM', which worked for almost half a century!<query> when did microsoft start</query> Microsoft is now in the position IBM was at its peak, where the migration costs (even if only perceived ones) will keep customers on board until the problems (or the annoyance in the case of Bill Gates) become too high. But Microsoft is now annoying a lot of people, so maybe that day is not too far away! Despite its rapid growth, at the start of the Millennium Microsoft's revenue was only a quarter that of IBM's; though its earnings had passed IBM in 1999 The most significant comparison, though, should be in terms of market capitalisation; where Microsoft's value on Wall Street, at just under $400 billion at the start of the new Millennium was two and a half times as big as that of IBM (even though that had quadrupled since its troubles in the early 1990s)!<query> what is the revenue of microsoft</query>"

For instance, if you wanted another layer of taste substitute taco or other seasoned shredded cheese for the plain cheddar cheese. You could also use one half cup cheddar and one half cup Swiss cheese. You could also get canned tomatoes with jalapeño peppers. Use a spicy Taco Seasoning Mix. The variations are endless.

In that post I shared information about foods we think are healthier for us than they really are. Today I am doing the opposite.<query> when is wordless wednesday</query> I am sharing information about foods we tend to think of as bad when they are often very healthy. There are many, many more foods than I list today that are healthier for you than you think. This is not an exhaustive list by any means. However it is a good start. Full Fat Cheese We tend to think of cheese as full of fat and calories and cholesterol. So we often opt for fat-free or low-fat cheese with all of the taste, nutrients and joys of eating sucked out. Full fat cheese is generally the kind you get in a whole chunk and that you have to slice yourself, as opposed to individually wrapped cheese slices. Full fat cheese is tastier and it is certainly more filling. Men’s Health magazine reports when eaten in moderation, 1-ounce per day, people lost weight because they felt full longer and thus ate less the rest of the day.<query> what is the difference between fat free and full fat cheese</query> And according to Danish research when eaten in moderation full fat cheese did not affect cholesterol levels. Here inAmerica we have so bought into the Food Police’s dictum that all fat is bad and should be eliminated that we have forgotten the pleasures of eating full-bodied foods. . That is too bad for several reasons. One, we do not know how DELICIOUS full fat foods are. And two, we do not know how satisfying and filling full fat foods are. So give yourself a treat and get some full fat cheese and eat an ounce a day and enjoy. You are worth it!!! Eggs Eggs are a much-maligned food. In the 80’s all we heard was how bad they were because of their high cholesterol count. The theory (guess) was that if we ate foods high in cholesterol we would increase our cholesterol.<query> why is cheese bad for you</query> Dieticians and researchers believed that foods high in cholesterol transferred their cholesterol directly to us. But that is not how it works. It is more complicated than that. Now 20 years later the incredible edible egg is still very much maligned. That is incredibly sad indeed. Eliminating eggs from your diet eliminates one of life’s real taste pleasures. And two, it eliminates one of nature’s nutrition powerhouses. Eggs are low in calories: 78. They are an inexpensive source of protein, Vitamins A, D, K, B12, calcium, iron, and zinc. Don’t believe me? The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has put out new nutrition data on eggs. To get the new data click the following link: Cracking the Cholesterol Myth. In addition to their deliciousness, I like eggs because they are relatively inexpensive, convenient, and versatile.<query> why do we eat eggs</query> You can hard boil them, fry them, scramble them and turn them into hundreds of different delicious and healthy meals in little time. If looking for egg recipes be sure to check the Recipe Tab at link above. Lots of great recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Potatoes Potatoes are on the dieticians and food polices target hit list these days. I guess since they can’t kick eggs around any more they are turning their sights on potatoes. Like with eggs, this is incredible. Like eggs, potatoes are incredibly nutrient rich. Remember your history? Potatoes kept Irish peasants alive during 1840-41 famine. Potatoes are high in protein and fiber. They are high in Vitamin C, calcium, phosphorus, iron, niacin, thiamin, and riboflavin. They only have 1 gram of fat.<query> what is the nutritional value of potatoes</query> They are a good source of carbs. [Source:International.] My word they are nearly the perfect food!!!! Here’s the issue. It is not the humble potato. Like with salads, it is what andhow much of what, we put on our potatoes. Does that mean I have to eat a potato plain? No. I don’t think so. When it comes to food my best suggestion is always think MODERATION. Just put fewer of each of your goodies on your potato. Corn Just because corn is a starch does not mean you should eliminate it from your diet. A six inch cob of corn (about ½ cup) has only 75 calories. It is full of protein, fiber, and loaded with the B-vitamins. One (1) cup of corn contains about 4 grams of fiber or 25% of the recommended daily amount.<query> what is the starch in corn</query> At 56 on the glycemic index corn is only at the moderate level, not high as many claim. Corn is sweet and for me there are few summer treats as lovely as cooked or grilled fresh corn-on-the-cob with a bit of butter and salt and pepper. Again, moderation is the key. Pizza Yes!!!! Pizza. Combine some bread, lycopene rich tomatoes, and some veggies and you have a darn good meal. Home made is best. And by home made I am not talking grow and mill your own wheat to make your own dough. If you have the time to do that, by all means….do it!! However, if you subscribe to the K.I.S.S. Principle* as I do, you can use English muffins or tortillas as I did inSo All May Eat.<query> what is the best summer meal</query> Just as healthy and just as delicious. *Keep It Simple Sweetheart! Eating Slowly Before closing, just a few words about eating slowly. Slow eating is the antithesis of living in the fast lane. It takes 20 minutes for the brain to receive the signal from the stomach that it is full. There is a growing body of evidence that eating slowly is healthier, can help you lose weight, promotes better digestion, and gives you more time to socialize with your family and friends. For me eating slowly is less about the health benefits and more about pure hedonist and pleasurable eating. When I eat slowly I can taste and savor every flavor I love. If that has additional health benefits, then so be it. I wrote about this in detail inEating With Pleasure. Featured Recipe Beef Taco Rice Skillet This is a super easy dish to make any night of the week.<query> why do we eat slowly</query>"

As a result of these agreements, more than 30 million students across the country will have access to healthier school meals – including at least 14 million students who currently participate in the free and reduced lunch program. AdvancePierre Foods, Domino’s Pizza, JTM Food Group, McCain Foods USA, Rich Products Corporation, Schwan’s Food Service, Trident Seafoods, HPS, Premier healthcare alliance, Summa/Provista, Interflex, Dole Food Company, Inc., and the National Turkey Federation have joined the effort to combat childhood obesity by agreeing to increase the availability of products that can lead to healthy schools meals.<query> who is the alliance for a healthier generation</query> Signatories to these first of their kind agreements brokered by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, founded by the American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation, have agreed to develop, market and competitively price products that will lead to healthier school meal options; streamline the ordering process; and make identifying healthy options easier. “With students consuming up to half of their daily calories at school, healthy school meals are key to winning the fight against childhood obesity,” said President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. Clinton Foundation. “Building on our agreements that have reduced the number of calories in beverages shipped to schools by 88 percent, the Alliance is now focusing on helping provide more nutritious meal options to more than 30 million school children nationwide.” Manufacturers including AdvancePierre Foods, Domino’s Pizza, JTM Food Group, McCain Foods USA, Rich Products Corporation, Schwan’s Food Service and Trident Seafoods pledge not to price healthy options out of reach of school cafeterias.<query> who is the founder of the william j clinton foundation</query> Signatories will set prices for healthier items that meet the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s science-based standards for nutrition at prices no higher than less healthy comparable products. Participating manufacturers have also pledged to increase the sales of compliant products by to least 50 percent of their entire school sales within five years. Manufacturers have committed to aggressively promote products that align with the Alliance’s Healthy Schools Program standards and will help schools meet or exceed the requirements currently being finalized by the USDA. Product commitments fall in at least one of the following categories within the Alliance’s science-based guidelines for school foods: Lean protein products, such as lean red meat, skinless poultry, lean deli meats, fat-free or low-fat cheese, beans, and tofu. Low-fat lunch entrées with reduced total fat, saturated fat and sodium levels.<query> what is the healthy schools program</query> GPOs have been successful at consolidating buying power in other institutional food service settings including hospitals, healthcare facilities and universities. By applying this same model to America’s schools, schools will see a savings of 10 to 20 percent in their food and beverage purchases. In order to help schools take the first step in changing their purchasing process, the Alliance is collaborating with the technology firm Interflex to create an online tool that streamlines the procurement process by assisting schools with planning, bidding and purchasing healthier products. Dole Food Company, Inc. and the National Turkey Federation have also agreed to leverage their tools and resources to support schools in their implementation of this new approach to school meals. “Today is just the beginning. The food manufacturer, group purchasing and technology agreements are just three components of the Alliance’s larger healthier school meals strategy with the goal of impacting more than 30 million students within a five year period,” said Ginny Ehrlich, executive director of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Additional components in the Alliance’s school meals strategy to support food service professionals being launched over the next year will include in-person and online training programs, menu planning and cooking techniques and recipes from celebrity chefs to school food service staff. Last week, the USDA released the proposed rule for the nutrition standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Program.<query> who is the alliance for a healthier generation</query> The goal of the Alliance is to reduce the nationwide prevalence of childhood obesity by 2015, and to empower kids to make healthy lifestyle choices. Founded in 2005 by the American Heart Association and William J. Clinton Foundation, the Alliance works to positively affect the places that can make a difference to a child’s health: homes, schools, doctor’s offices and communities.

clueweb12-1313wb-19-08565,49,1,"These are the benefits of moving: Living much, much closer to family and friends. Our travel costs will drop significantly, since we currently spend anywhere from $2000 to $4000 on flights every year, plus insurance and car expenses for this road-loving city. We both really miss our family and friends, and they all live within a day’s drive of New York City. We met in Ithaca, NY, and would love to have the option to travel there for some of the key weekends, like Reunion, Slope Day, Apple/ Chili/ or Ithaca Festivals, etc. Phoenix is too harsh an environment to raise a family. No offense to those who love it, but we don’t want our (future) children living in such a polluted, dry environment — we can barely handle it, and we’re adults!<query> what is the benefit of moving to phoenix</query> We want trees to clean the air and grass in the yard or the park, not rocks, sand, and scorpions. Also, we want to be closer to family by the time we have kids (in maybe five to ten years). My fitness level has declined since moving here as well, because I can’t run outside due to the pollution levels. Driving in Phoenix is terrible and dangerous. We also love the idea of living in an area wheredriving a car isn’t required, so we could potentially get rid of one vehicle. (Ideally, we’d live within walking distance of a train line that connects to Grand Central.) Getting rid of a vehicle would save us a few thousand dollars per year, and a lot of headaches. I grew up in Connecticut, so I’m used to NYC rush-hour traffic, and trust me, it doesn’t hold a candle to the chaos of the drivers that hit the road (and each other) in Phoenix every day.<query> why is driving dangerous in phoenix</query> But moving isn’t without its drawbacks, which include: Expensive housing. Right now, we pay only $650/month for a two-bedroom apartment with a washer/dryer in the unit (plus utilities). Similar units where we’re looking to move would run about $900-$1200 per month. I might be able to convince my employer to give a small cost-of-living raise, but we’d still have less wiggle room in our finances. Luckily, our debt payments won’t increase based on where we live, so not all of our expenses will rise. Jobs situation. My employer (an engineering firm) has offices back east, and I’m looking into getting a transfer to an office they’re expanding. But my husband works for ASU, and clearly Arizona State does not have any east coast offices.<query> cost of living to move</query> He wants to start his own cleaning company someday, but in the meantime he’s getting hands-on experience working in the facilities management department of the university. This also affords us both free tuition, and clearly (as evidenced by our student loan debt), we place a high value on education rather than on material possessions. He’d have a wide variety of schools to apply to, if we lived near New York City, but we don’t know what the job market for universities is like back east yet. So, GRS readers, what should we do? Do we stay here a few more years and pay down debt, but possibly losing the opportunity to transfer to another office within my company and miss out on visiting family/friends for a few more years? Or do we move when we have the chance, even if it reduces our capacity for savings/debt repayment for a few years?We’d love opinions from people who have made similar moves in the past, or from people who live in the greater NYC area.<query> what to do if you live in nyc</query> J.D.’s note: This is a tough one. I can see arguments for both sides. On the one hand, I think it makes sense to stay put for a few years so that Jennifer and her husband can be aggressive with debt. But if they’re miserable, what’s the point? One possible solution would be to find an interim place to live — someplace inexpensive yet liveable — for a few years while they aggressively pay down debt. 175 Comments This article is about Ask the Readers, Choices, House and Home For more helpful articles like this, subscribe to our free newsletter and join thousands who are improving their real-life money management with help from Get Rich Slowly.

When we lived right outside the city, we paid $1350 for an apartment within walking distance to the trains, but we paid a huge amount in train passes. We also paid a lot for every other cost. Now we live a good distance from the city, and the rents are not much cheaper (utilities are), but we still pay around $450 in train costs during the months where my husband is traveling regularly in to the city (1x per week). Both of those locations also demamded we have a car, as while the train was walkable, grocery stores, laundromats, etc aren’t always. And there are some towns, such as where my in laws live where there are essentially no jobs.<query> how much does it cost to live far from the train station</query> You can get a cheaper rent, but may not have the guarantee of a second income. It’s hard without some clear information like general region (Westchester, Jersey, NYC, Ulster County, Lower CT, etc), expected lifestyle (daily commuting into the city, occasional city visits, etc) and relative size of apartment (1 BR, 2 BR, house) to even begin to guess if your plans are reasonable or dangerously short-sighted, let alone offer any solid advice. loading.... Reply 2 chett daniel says: 28 January 2011 at 4:42 am Moving will add another $2000 of expenses up front. Once you pay for the actual move, deposits, and multiple misc. expenses you will shell out quite a bit of money. Is your employer willing to cover moving expenses? We moved five times is six years.<query> how much money do you need to move</query> All but one of the moves were employer paid. The last few moves had the same objective as yours, to get close to our roots. Still, you’re looking at this as an “either, or” situation. You said you’re both single. What prevents you from moving now, picking up some extra income (JD has several posts on legit ways to do that)and continuing to pay down debt? You are already in the “bust your ass” mode from college. You could just apply that to a second job and be closer to home now. I don’t see your situation as only having two options. loading.... Reply 3 Derek says: 28 January 2011 at 4:48 am I agree with J.D. Stay put for a couple of years and pay that student loan down as much as possible while you are without children and have no large expenses.<query> can you move while single</query> My wife and I are in the same situation. We are both in our mid 20′s and I got a job 1,400 miles away from our home. It was exciting at the time, but a couple of years later, and we’re really itching to go back. Luckily, we were able to live cheaply and pay off about $15,000 of our student loans so far. Only $4,800 to go! Once we pay off the last chunk, we will consider moving back. loading.... Reply 4 Lonnie @ My Income Lab says: 28 January 2011 at 5:13 am I live in NYC (my wife and I both born and raised, we’re in Brooklyn now) and, if I were you, I would stay in Phoenix as long as possible. Get rid of your debt. Assume rent is going to cost you $1800/month and save up enough cash to cover a years worth of rent (this should not be your emergency savings, leave that be).<query> how much money can you save to pay off student loans</query> And make sure you have work when you get here. Our combined salaries are in the low 120s, yet it is still very difficult to have any savings, invest for retirement, etc (we don’t have a car, and our expenses are stripped bare,damn you credit card debt!) Rent, childcare, and groceries taking the biggest chunks out of our cash flow. NYC is a great place to raise a family; you have access to so much, and I feel like my children are more savvy growing up here (sorry, little NYC snobbery sneaked in there, I can’t help it, I am from here!) My 3yr old daughter knows what trains to take to get back home! But I wouldn’t come here with kids; if you do move here, wait a couple years before the kids come so you can build a nice cash-flow first.<query> what is the best place to raise a family</query> FYI, my wife and I want to move out west; we want a slower lifestyle and lower cost of living, but our careers are just starting to take off, so that is keeping us here at the moment. loading.... Reply 5 Money Smarts Blog says: 28 January 2011 at 5:13 am This one is tough. A great case study on how debt can be an albatross affecting your every move. I’m inclined to say move anyway. You guys obviously hate where you live, so just do it. It sounds like you have some flexibility on where you move to, so try to keep your costs down. loading.... Reply 6 Irene says: 28 January 2011 at 5:14 am The one thing that stands out to me is that very soon you will have a masters in engineering and a few years experience.<query> can you move out of debt</query> That would put your pay on the east coast near 65000 or 70000, without considering what your husband is able to bring in. You may double some expenses, and cut others, but he easiest way to cut debt faster is to make more money. I would move once your degree is finished if there will be a pay increase to do so! loading....

But now I’ve got a slower lifestyle (and better weather) out West on my mind, though probably still a major city.<query> how much money do you need to make to cut debt</query> If you’re seriously thinking about moving to NYC, know that your return on that investment will be cultural… it takes a lot of work to truly get ahead there and after a while, you might get sick of all the inherited affluence — I couldn’t stand Manhattan after being there a couple years. Brooklyn, however, is one of the best places on Earth. These decisions shouldn’t all be logical and everything can’t be based on finances. At some point, you’ve got to stop worrying and live your life. You’re young and you will never get this time back. Follow your heart, try to stay true to your goals, but don’t sacrifice everything… or you’ll wake up one day in your 70s, on a pile of money but no fulfilling memories.

My advice – life is too short to live somewhere that you don’t want to live. If you want to be closer to family – do it. If you want to live somewhere tropical, cold, in the mountains, whatever – do it.<query> how long does it take to leave a job after you have lived somewhere</query> You’ll only regret staying put because you were too scared to the pull the trigger and take action.

Our combined salary before tax was between 38k (grad school) to 100k (last 2 years, Westchester). We had 2 small children (babysitter, day care, afterschool, private school…). We also traveled. Granted, we lived in subsidized place for the first half of the time (1/2 usual rent, University), afterwards it was steer and clear. It is possible to do. Everything is possible to do. Here, in US, lots of things are considered as “having to give up”.<query> where do you live in nyc</query> What helped us – we never got used to most of “US life” to begin with. But – my point is, figure out the exact reason you want to move – and if you’re willing to stick with it. Oftentimes (and I am not saying always, or almost so) youth friendships fade, and while love for relatives doesn’t go away, living too close puts a strain on relationships. I think at 20-something we, for the most part, simply have no clue what we want in life. So, if both of you agree you need to move, tighten the belt and move. Just don’t treat it as a dream that will never fail. Be ready to face dissapointments and another move, along with financial strains. Which, by the way, are not the end of the world.<query> why do you need to move</query> Just manage better:) loading.... Reply 11 KT says: 28 January 2011 at 6:09 am There are a lot of other places that are beautiful areas which cost a lot less to live in than New York City. For example I was recently talking to a lawyer who lives near Miami, FL. He said he had dinner with a friend who is part of an NYC power couple making in excess of $800K who owns a $3.2 million penthouse. He probably makes 1/4 to 1/3 of that – which is hardly bad, but less than he could be making in New York City. His conclusion was that his life was better in Florida. There are lots of smaller cities dotted around this country with much lower costs of living than New York City, Washington DC, San Francisco, and the rest.<query> what is the cost of living in miami fl</query> Speaking as someone in a high cost of living area with no debt and a good income stream who is looking with extreme nervousness at a housing market where the average detached home sells for $621K and an inexpensive 1 bedroom place to rent costs you $1300/mo (not including any utilities but water), I’d say look elsewhere. loading.... Reply 12 Susan says: 28 January 2011 at 6:11 am I think you should decide where to live based entirely on non-financial factors, like being near friends and family and enjoying your surroundings. I am also in the middle of very aggressively paying down six figures of student loans. I am a proponent of delaying lots of things to get out of debt (we are not saving for retirement or buying a home until the loans are gone, for example, and our emergency fund is a mere $1,000 – we’re basically doing the Dave Ramsey plan).<query> average cost of living for a house</query> There are three areas of life where I wouldn’t let financial goals influence my decisions: when to get married, when to have kids, and where to live.

Also, congratulations on being in such great financial shape so early in life! loading.... Reply 13 retirebyforty says: 28 January 2011 at 6:14 am IMHO, you should not move yet.

Meanwhile, pay down your debt and keep looking for better opportunity. Don’t get tie down with your company. loading.... Reply 14 MikeTheRed says: 28 January 2011 at 6:20 am This is the sort of issue my wife and I are struggling with to some extent.<query> should you move if the cost of living is going to rise</query> Where we are now is not where we want to be, but we don’t hate it, and the career prospects here are very good for me at the moment. Despite all of that, we may very well move in the next 1-2 years depending on how life turns out. In your case, it’s obvious you don’t like where you are at all, but you’re struggling with the financial impact of making a move that big. Here’s what I would suggest doing: 1. Save the Difference in Current vs Expected Living Expenses. Take your rent, utilities etc and add it all up for the month. Then do a bit of digging and get an estimate of how much more it would cost in NYC (or wherever else you want to go). Take the difference between the two numbers and start saving it.<query> how to calculate cost of moving</query> Build up a 12-18 month difference fund. This way, when you’re ready to move, living expenses aren’t going to be a huge strain for the first year or so. 2. Save The Equivalent of 6 Months of Your Husband’s Take-Home Pay While you may be able to transfer jobs, it sounds like he may not be so lucky. To give you a buffer, put away 6 months of his take-home pay into another savings account. While you may be able to live extra frugal on just your income, essentially having his income for another half year can help the transition a lot. This gives him a good cushion of time in which to find new work. 3. Reduce Your Student Loan Payments For a Short Time You’re paying down those loans at a really aggressive rate. If you’re dead-set on moving, reduce your payments for a short while to fund the difference and salary accounts.<query> how to save for a move</query> As soon as you hit those goals though, go back to your current payments. I personally feel it’s far more important to be happy than to have a lot of money. That said, if you’re in a position to make the transition smoother and more secure in financial terms, I highly suggest doing so. Moving that distance and making that big of a life adjustment will be very expensive beyond your new housing costs. It may mean waiting a year or two, but moving with some security will help immensely. When I made my drastic career/location move, I went deeper into debt and it impacted my life for years. The next time I move, I’m going to be in a much better position. loading....

Reply 19 Leigh says: 28 January 2011 at 6:55 am In agreement with others, it is quite difficult to move once you have lived in a city and begun making friends, professional connections, etc. If you don’t like where you are, move once you complete grad school. However, as one who lives in a high cost of living area, be careful about choosing such a location. The paychecks rarely make up the difference. Consider all the things you want in your life. A house, children, travel, additional education, being debt free for life, living near family, raising chickens. Whatever.

But if neither of you has lived in NYC before, it’s going to be a culture shock. You will have to make some huge lifestyle changes to be able to live there and still save enough to cover your loan payments.

Well, coming from someone who has one in elementary school and been thinking about a move, the decision to move gets harder as they get older, are doing well in school and making friends. If you think its hard to leave from your own friends like another person stated you can’t imagine what it’s like to try to think about how it’s going to affect the kids. We made the decision to move closer to family before we had kids and before our parents got too old to travel to us.

The reasons were many. But I made the move, in a fully loaded pickup truck hauling pretty much all of my life’s possessions, during the exact month in ’08 when gasoline hit it’s all-time high, drove 2,500 miles, then promptly landed in the state which would soon develop one of the highest unemployment rates in the country during the nation’s financial crisis.<query> why do i move to nyc</query> Since then, my fiancee and I have dealt with enough financial nightmares for a book.

Not to mention other areas in NY like Rochester, Syracuse, and Binghamton. With respect to university positions. I will say that the SUNY system is hurting a bit from what I hear given the NY state is trying to bleed everyone tax wise and shrink the univerisities budgets, but that may not prevent you from getting a job there or at one of the many private universities in the area you might be looking at. I’m just thinking promotions in that area might be limited. So the upshot, my take would be move to NYC or somewhere back closer to family if that’s what you want to try.

Although sometimes Suze’s blanket advice doesn’t hold water for everyone, in this book I think she does a great job of tailoring solutions for the recent grad, no-money-yet, big-school-debt crowd. It was written in 2006ish, so while some of the info on interest rates and such is out of date, it still has great strategies and info. I’d credit it with really helping me sort out retirement savings. Finally, Suze always says, people first, then money, then things.<query> who wrote the book the money book for the young, fabulous, and broke?</query> Your situation sounds to me like a people-first one, and you are looking for permission to make that choice over a money-focused one. I say go for it. P.S. 3% is an enviable interest rate, and while I admire your drive to pay it off, keeping that debt won’t cost you much financially, but it may have opportunity cost. loading.... Reply 48 NoTrustFund says: 28 January 2011 at 8:07 am I’m strongly in the move the East Coast camp. Life is short and you should be where you want to be. I made a big move a few years ago (although to a lower cost of living city) to be closer to my family and it’s been the best thing I’ve ever done. It sounds as though you are careful with your money so I trust you will make good decisions after the move.<query> what is the interest rate on a move</query> Finish your Masters, and keep paying down as much debt as possible, but then get out of there. It is great that you will be able to make the move with one job already set. I’m with @Bogey, it will only get harder to make the move. It is so easy to let momentum take hold and stay living where you do not want to be. Good luck! loading.... Reply 49 Heidi says: 28 January 2011 at 8:07 am Life is short, you sound like very responsible and smart individuals. You can stay a little longer and pay down more debt but it sounds like if you are making a huge emotional sacrifice. If you can still find a way to pay off your debt, shift things around a bit, your move closer to the big city and family may be optimization of your now, the present is just as important.<query> can you stay in debt and pay down debt</query> We tend to live a little too much in the future, balance is what guarantees that you are not too hard on yourself now. I am not saying to go on a shopping spree and forget about saving. Once you can find jobs that cover the cost of living increase, go for it. On the bright side you always have more job opportunities in the bigger cities in case you should be laid off. It will work out for the best in the end, either way. loading.... Reply 50 Val says: 28 January 2011 at 8:09 am If you like your employer, take the opportunity to get a transfer to the new office. It may never come up again and you may not be happy in another job. Your housing cost increase won’t be huge, and it seems that it would balance out by not needing 2 cars (if that’s the case) or buying flights to visit family.<query> how to balance cost of living increase</query> loading....

Make the Choice Not to Decay How to Make Money at the Farmers Market Shopping for the Sake of Shopping Ask the Readers: Should We Move to a More Expensive Part of the Country? Friday, 28th January 2011 (by J.D. Roth) 175 Comments Share The Friday “Ask the Readers” column generally follows a set format: I introduce the topic, share a reader e-mail, give my best advice, and then ask for your feedback. Today’s column is a little different. Jennifer sent me a 1000-word question, and rather than write any sort of response, I’m just going to let her have the entire space. Everything that follows is from Jennifer. My husband and I are in our mid twenties (no children yet), and currently both employed full time with good benefits.<query> how to make money at the farmers market</query> We live in Phoenix, which has a relatively lowcost of living (our rent and utilities total about $800/month). Before taxes, we probably make a combined $75,000 per year. While this sounds great, a large portion of our income (about $1300/month) goes toward aggressively paying down our large student loan debts (~$120,000 combined, most at 3%). Although our loan terms last up to 20 years, we’re on track to pay them off in ten years — quicker, if we increase our payments as our incomes increase. Other than our student loans, we have very little debt, at very low interest rates: I have about $6000 on my 0% car loan, and my husband has about $1000 in 0% credit card debt. We’ve also managed to save a good amount of money in the two years since graduating college.<query> how much money do you make a year on student loans</query> Although we can’t yet max out our retirement accounts, we both have tax-advantaged accounts. (I have aRoth IRA and Roth 401k, he has a 403b and a state retirement plan.) Since the beginning of 2009, we’ve managed to save over $15,000 in cash (emergency fund contributions and wedding gifts), and about $20,000 in retirement savings. Now that you know our background, here’s our question: Should we move to an area of the country that has a much higher cost of living, but better intangible benefits? Or should we stay where it’s cheap and pay down more debt? We’ve agreed that we want to be out of the Phoenix area within three to five years, but we aren’t sure if now is the right time. I finish my Master’s degree in a few months, and it’s the only thing really anchoring us here at the moment other than our jobs.<query> how much money do you need to save for retirement</query>"

That means there are a lot of options for the Suns and nobody has a clue as to who’s going to work for the Suns.

I had a dream about the draft the other night….in it the Suns picked Tristan Thompson. Which I suppose is somewhat realistic.

FYI, since they pick ahead of us, the buzz is that they like Klay Thompson and are not looking to give up Monta Ellis just yet.

Would be nice though The candidates I am hoping somehow fallto us (and wishful thinking) are Jonas Valenciunas (no chance considering Cleveland wants him bad), Bismack Biyombo. Having said that, I just read that the Bobcats are targetting Biyombo. They were #1 on defense a year ago and they slipped to below average this last season and they want to change that. With Richard Cho as the new GM at Bobcats, they are wheeling and dealing already!! by az_kevin on Jun 23, 2011 4:06 PM MDT up reply actions but between Kemba and Biyombo, I would take Biyombo. by az_kevin on Jun 23, 2011 4:14 PM MDT up reply actions Kahwi Lenoard though?<query> who is the bobcats target</query> Short, but a much more talented Faried.

He is new to BB and can pick up some. he is a intelligent player. If I read correctly, Givony of Draftepxress rates Irving and Biyombo as the only two stars of this draft and clearly said ignore Biyombo at your peril. by az_kevin on Jun 23, 2011 4:18 PM MDT up reply actions I'm freakin in love with the idea of Biyombo I’ll be disappionted when the Raps draft him at 5.<query> who is the only star in the raps draft</query> Bismack Biyombo or Bust!!! by jc79 on Jun 23, 2011 4:20 PM MDT up reply actions Not happening.

I don’t want Shumpert even if we pick him at 20 unless of course he is the only guy available meaning Faried is gone which he very well could be.

Now if they could get Nash… by BringBackBarkley17 on Jun 23, 2011 4:22 PM MDT up reply actions forgot to mention The reason they badly need a Center is Bargnani is really a PF and he would be a good one as he can spread teh floor. But as Center he is not effective and not allowing the PF’s to be effective. What Toronto badly needs is a Center, a SF. They also need a PG as they want to trade their PG. by az_kevin on Jun 23, 2011 4:22 PM MDT up reply actions So they need everything? Agreed. Glad we settled that. by BringBackBarkley17 on Jun 23, 2011 4:29 PM MDT up reply actions All this Shumpert talk is really starting to worry me...

I mean, one day some time in the future, the NBA will start up again. But that could be months, or even a year from now. Today is it. It's the last day on which we have absolute 100% certainty there will be at least 1 transaction executed by the Suns' Front Office. I'm sure Suns President Lon Babby and GM Lance Blanks, and even scouting director John Treloar, did not sleep well last night or maybe even in the last 2 months since their honeymoon of absolution from blame ended with the last Suns game of the 2010-2011 season.<query> when does the nba draft start</query> Worst day getting drafted by the Cavs and going through the emotional rollercoaster that followed.

What will the Suns do? Let's look at the options. Make a big trade to move into the top 4 of the Draft Since Babby went on record yesterday to pull the Suns' only 2 top-of-draft-worthy trade chips off the market, this idea can be put to rest.

Oklahoma City is even floating littleEric Maynor. They all want a specific player and are willing to give up a key rotation piece to get it. And then there's the teams with multiple #1s, wanting to parlay them into a lottery pick of their own. Of course, these teams are going to play poker all night, waiting to see if their player drops and then make the real offer at the lowest possible moment (ie. why offer player x and y for the 6th pick when you could offer just player x for the 9th?).<query> what teams are floated in the lottery</query> But the wolves would prolly package smith and flynn to fill a hole like sg, center, or pg.

Here’s the breakdown, fellas. I would love to acquire Beasley and/or another pick, but I am going to go with the safe and say it’s probably not going to happen. I am going to assume that we stay at 13 and that the following six guys will definitely be gone: Irving, Williams, Kanter, Vesely, Knight, Leonard. So out of the rest of the guys who could potentially fall to our position, here is my top 10, in order. Pick whoever falls: 1) Valanciunas 2) T. Thompson 3) Biyombo 4) K. Thompson 5) Fredette 6) Markieff Morris 7) Kemba Walker 8) Alec burks 9) Marcus Morris 10) Faried Honorable mention: Hamilton, Singleton, Shumpert Now in terms of talent, I think Burks and Walker have more than Morris, but I know we like him and that Babby wants to do something safe after being panned for every single move he’s made, so I slid him up slightly.<query> who is the nfl draft pick</query> Now, here’s my mock 1)Irving – Cavs have to. Anything else would be stupid. 2) Williams – Could be a trade, could be Kanter 3) Kanter – Kanter is better for the Jazz than Knight and I think they get he or Williams 4) Valanciunas – Buyout, but rumored Cavs will take him. Get high pick next year too! 5) Knight – Raps want a PG and this is Knight’s floor 6) Vesley – Could be Leonard. Tough choice, but more potential here 7) Leonard – This has to happen. Perfect fit for Sac-town. 8) Thompson – Could be Biyombo but Dumars needs a recovery and goes with safe. 9) Marcus Morris – Same with Jordan.<query> who is the cavs pg pick</query> Can’t afford to take risk. 10) K. Thompson – could be Burks, but I think they take the shooter 11) Biyombo – damn you, Warriors. They like Klay but Burks not as much 12) Fredette – has to happen especially if first pick is Williams or Kanter Now, that leaves us with our likeliest choices as Kemba, Markieff or Alec Burks with Faried, Shumpert, Hamilton and Singleton as outside chances. I think the FO will scratch Burks off the list because they feel they can get a SG in free agency or trades easier than big man. I think Kemba is possible especially if we are totally sold on getting rid of Brooks. However, the most likely pick is Markieff Morris, and he is quite likely to be your newest Phoenix Sun if we stay at 13.<query> who is the most likely pick for the warriors</query> The FO needs to recover from some widely panned moves, and will pick something safe. There is no way they have the balls to take someone like Shumpert. If Thompson, Valanciunas or Biyombo fall, they might take the risk, and I’ll be extremely upset if they don’t. But I don’t think those 3 fall, and I think we are looking at another twin. Oh boy. by BringBackBarkley17 on Jun 23, 2011 1:58 PM MDT reply actions I still think Utah will pick Kemba over Jimmer at 12, even though the fans may not like it. by Lompe on Jun 23, 2011 2:03 PM MDT up reply actions other than that, a very good breakdown by Lompe on Jun 23, 2011 2:03 PM MDT up reply actions Thanks.<query> who does utah pick</query> You might be right. If so, we should take the Jimmer. by BringBackBarkley17 on Jun 23, 2011 2:29 PM MDT up reply actions I would be really happy with Biyombo or Kemba I doubt either one of them slip that far though. Thompson would be my next choice, but again, he’s projected pretty high. Markieff could be okay for us, but he’s not very exciting. Jimmer’s exciting, but I don’t think he’ll be more than JJ Redick/Eddie House Singleton is one of the best defenders in the draft, but I don’t see our FO taking another Faried will be solid, and you’ll never doubt his effort, but he’s strictly a role-player. I don’t know if our FO takes him at 13. I hope they don’t reach for Shumpert at 13.<query> who is the best defender in the draft</query> The Suns, on the other hand, are offering an inexpensive 7'1"" 260lb 22-yr old Center (Robin Lopez) in exchange for a pick anywhere in the lottery. Sounds reasonable, right? It just may be. TheWarriors turned down Lopez for the #11, but if other offers fail to materialize and their fave players are off the board, don't you think GS reconsiders? Chance of happening: 10% Trade the #13 and player(s) for another team's quality player(s) and/or picks Suns have reportedly talked to Minnesota about trading them Lopez, Pietrus and #13 forMichael Beasley and #20. Likely the Suns could walk away with one of their faves - Shumpert, Markieff Morris or Kenneth Faried at #20 and go home happy. Chance of happening: 20% Keep the #13, draft the best remaining player on their board of faves, and go home If all else fails, and the Suns don't connect with just the right team, just the right offer and just the right time, then likely they find themselves on the clock at 13 and will just draft whoever's left on their board.<query> what team does robin lopez play for</query> He can be good, but again…quite the stretch if you pick him in the lootto. So basically….Biyombo, Kemba, Tristan are my top 3. Anything else after that and it’s a crapshoot for me.

Bismack Biyombo or Bust!!! by jc79 on Jun 23, 2011 2:58 PM MDT up reply actions I agree about Kemba and Biyombo another person I would add to that is Jonas Valenciunas. But it seems with the contract issues for Biyombo and Valenciunas, their stock will fall some meaning chances of Tristan Thompson, Morris twins, Kemba Walker, Klay Thompson increase and hence the chances of Biyombo falling to us increases. I just hope the SUNS FO is not stupid and seal a deal to trade away #13 or trade down too soon in case a good player is falling to #13 just as they had done when they trade the pick that was Iggy.<query> who is bismack biyombo</query> by az_kevin on Jun 23, 2011 2:43 PM MDT up reply actions You think GS would pick Biyombo even though they spent last year's 6th pick on Udoh?

clueweb12-1702wb-33-10935,50,1,"A Historical Overview of American Soccer History 4 SPECIALTY GIFTS Soccer Player History An Overview of American Soccer History By Dave Litterer The American Soccer History Archives This page is a detailed historical overview of United States soccer from its roots in the 19th century to the present day. Origins, 1609-1862 Various forms of soccer-style games have been around since Roman times, and the United States was the first British colony to start playing soccer-style games. Some form of football was played in the Colonies as far back as the establishment of the original Jamestown settlement in 1609. The rules are unclear, but they most likely resembled the sprawling Shrovetide games then popular in England. It was soon banned by ordinance as a reputed bad influence, and for the next two centuries appeared only in the least restricted of colonial communities.<query> when did soccer start</query> This was a trend in Europe as well as the US. As immigration increased, the new arrivals brought soccer traditions with them, and the game grew rapidly in the northeastern industrial cities. The growth first took place in the West Hudson region of New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City, soon spreading by the late 1870's to Fall River, and New Bedford, MA. Pick-up games and loose informal teams soon grew into established clubs and led to corporate sponsorship finally the development of local and even regional leagues. The game spread to other parts of New England including Boston and Rhode Island, and into Baltimore, and in the 1880's, into Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis, and finally Pittsburgh. The game was continually hampered by sociological forces-- Baseball was seen as the American past-time, and many immigrants would attempt to Americanize themselves to assimilate, often switching to baseball from soccer which was seen increasingly as a sport only played by foreigners.<query> where did soccer originate</query> The league also signed a five year TV contract in 2001. Finally, a first class soccer-specific stadium opened in Los Angeles in 2003, with other stadiums confirmed or in proposal stages at Dallas, Chicago and New York. The Indoor game saw some consolidation as the NPSL morphed into the new single-entity Major Indoor Soccer League II, eventually absorbing the World Indoor Soccer League, and beginning a renaissance in 2004. A new phenomenon was launched in 2003, with a highly successful tour by Manchester United and several other top European clubs. Although not sponsored by MLS, the tour saw sellout crowds at some of the largest US Stadiums, leading MLS to set up tours of their own in 2004. The USL saw continued consolidation with increasing strength in their 2nd Division A-League, and great expansion in their Super Y-League.<query> when did the mls start</query> Increasingly, MLS clubs established reserve squads who played in USL’s amateur division. Overall, as 2004 progressed, there were a number of positive directions being taken at all levels of US soccer, particularly steps to ensure the long-term viability of the game.

All rights reserved.<query> when did soccer start</query> In 1884, a group of ex-British enthusiasts met in Newark and formed the American Football Association, the fourth national association to be formed. Besides attempting to coordinate the proliferating local and regional amateur leagues, the AFA established the first National Championship competition, the American Cup, which was first won by ONT (""Our New Thread"", brand name for the sponsoring sewing manufacturer in Kearny, NJ) in 1885. Before the cup's suspension in 1898, the bulk of the champions were primarily from Southeastern New England, which had turned into the first true soccer hotbed in the country, with its ""golden triangle"" of Fall River, Pawtucket and New Bedford. The AFA also organized the first national team, which played two games against Canada (a 0-1 loss on 11/28/1885, and a 3-2 win in 1886).<query> when was the american football association formed</query> Soccer grew at a moderate pace during the early 1890's, spreading to Denver, Cincinnati, Cleveland and even San Francisco and Los Angeles by the end of the century. Corporate sponsorship had led to some leagues attaining semi-pro stats, and more and more teams were based on cultural and ethnic organizations rather than factories and corporations. The AFA favored the semi-pro clubs in its American Cup scheduling, and the New York clubs withdrew in protest to form the American Amateur Football Association in 1893. The game was slowly being reintroduced on a low-level basis in colleges. Finally, in 1894, the first attempt was made to establish a fully professional soccer league. Interestingly, this league was not promoted by any of the existing soccer associations, but was formed by a group of professional baseball owners from the National league, and was intended to fill the baseball stadiums during down time.<query> when did soccer start</query> The league even used The American League of Professional Football had six teams from major Northeastern cities, and made its 1894 debut with much fanfare, but attendance was low after the first week, partially to the scheduling of too many weekday games, and some managers used less than ethical measures to procure overseas players. The league collapsed among heavy financial losses during its first season. The Doldrums, 1895-1913 It was not long before the powers that be attempted to follow on the ALPF's footsteps at a more financially responsible level. The National Association Football League was formed in 1895 from premier teams of the New York City and New Jersey regional leagues, and struggled through four seasons. By this time, there was a waning enthusiasm exacerbated by the infighting among the various associations. Fan interest and participation were falling, and the NAFBL and the American Cup were both suspended in 1898.<query> when was the nafbl formed</query> Other sports were becoming popular such as Polo and Boxing, and suddenly soccer did not look so important anymore. This would not last for long fortunately. In 1904, US teams participated in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, winning the gold. This must have sparked some enthusiasm, as the St. Louis Soccer League went professional in 1906, the same year as the NAFBL and the American Cup was revived. By this time, New England was beginning to wane as the premier hotbed of the country and most American Cup winners would come from New Jersey/New York or Philadelphia. The revived National Association Football League, formed by a group of people from regional state and local leagues, consisted of teams, which had previously played in municipal leagues. Originally operating out of the New York-New Jersey area, it eventually added Bethlehem Steel, a powerhouse from eastern Pennsylvania, and the league operated until 1921.<query> when did soccer start</query> This was the first truly successful pro league in the US. The formation of FIFA in 1904 left the USA on the outside looking in due to the lack of a truly national organizing association. However, the addition of Soccer as an official medal sport for the 1908 Olympics led to increasing interest in international competition (following the hugely successful 1906 tour by Pilgrim FC from England in 1906). FIFA would not recognize either the AFA or the AAFA as a legitimate national body, locked as they were in a bitter war. By this time, the AFA was allied with the English FA, but their actions angered many, and a number of key regional associations switched allegiance to the AAFA. Finally, after FIFA had rejected an American application for membership at their 1912 congress, the rapidly growing AAFA members met on April 5, 1913 and formed the United States Football Association, which was accepted by FIFA.<query> when was soccer created</query> The AFA threw in its towel at this point, but the American Cup until 1929. One objective of this new association was to end the struggle between amateur and professional soccer organizations for hegemony, a struggle that would last well into the 1960's until the Association became more professionalized under the direction of Werner Fricker. The First Dynasties, 1913-1921 The ethnic influence affected the course of the game through the early 1900's -- it was still clustered mainly in working-class communities along the northeastern part of the United States, as well as some selected cities such as St. Louis, Chicago and Pittsburgh. Leagues were mostly amateur and semi-pro, usually very localized and based on state associations. Eventually its growing success resulted in attempts to establish national leagues. At this time, due to the United States large size and the difficulty of transportation, there were no true national leagues, even major league baseball was entirely situated in the northeast and Midwest, although minor leagues operated all over the country.<query> when did professional soccer start</query> The same occurred with Soccer, with true major leagues earning that title mainly through their higher level of professionalism, rather than the amount of territory covered. Soccer went into a mini-decline around the turn of the century, which was reversed by the re-establishment of the NASFL and American Cup in 1906, and the decision of the St. Louis Soccer League to turn fully professional. The tide started to shift from New England to the New York/New Jersey region, as the NAFBL gained strength and the cup was won primarily by New York-based teams. The Southern New England Football league formed in 1914, out of some of the stronger of the local semi-pro teams in New England. By this time, soccer was also established in Eastern Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Chicago, and Pittsburgh, and had made its re-entry at several dozen colleges.<query> when was soccer established</query> Probably the most important developments to follow the establishment of the USFA (Now the USSF) were the establishment of an official national championship tournament (the National Challenge Cup), which was first played in 1914, and the debut of sanctioned international competition. The Challenge Cup, open to any club that wished to enter, amateur or pro, was the first truly national competition, and did much to increase the prestige of the game. Now known as the US Open Cup, this is the oldest continuous team sport tournament in the country (outside of the World Series and Hockey's Stanley Cup), but in later years, the cup struggled to be taken seriously by the ISL and NASL in the 1960's. By this time, the first true dynasties were beginning to emerge, among the Fall River Rovers, Bethlehem Steel, Kearny Scots and others.<query> when was the us open cup established</query> Their first games, in 1916, included a 3-2 win over the new Swedish team, and a 1-1 draw with Norway. Sadly, World War I derailed the international tours, and the US did not field a national team again until the 1924 Olympics. Three of the early dynasties of American Soccer were the Fall River Rovers, winners of the American Cup in 1888 and 1889, and Bethlehem Steel, who won the American Cup in 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1919 (finalist in 1920), and winners of the National Challenge Cup in 1915, 1916, 1918, and 1919 (finalist in 1917). Bethlehem won the first ""doubles"", copping both cups in 1916, 1918 and 1919. In fact, Bethlehem won a ""triple"" in 1919, by virtue of also winning the NASFL title that year (followed by league titles the next two seasons).<query> when did the first american soccer team start</query> The Golden Era, 1921-1933 The 1920's were widely considered the first Golden Era in American Soccer. With the founding of the American Soccer League in 1921, there was finally a league with enough prestige to compete effectively for European players, and even perform on a par with the early National Football League. During the 1920-1921 season, the Southern New England Football League and the National Association Football League were suffering financial difficulties. Although both leagues had powerhouse teams such as Bethlehem Steel, New York F.C., J&P Coates and Fall River, both leagues were split among haves and have-nots, and the richer teams felt they were subsidizing the poorer ones to their detriment. They solved this dilemma by pulling the plugs on both leagues, with the richer clubs joining together to form the nucleus of a new league, the ASL.<query> when was the golden era of soccer</query> This group attempted to establish a series of rules, which would please everyone, but they couldn't resolve issues such as use of hands, allowing hacking of opponents, etc. Many supporters of these elements (considered more ""manly"") eventually withdrew and formed the Rugby Football Union, and the FA established rules more similar to the modern game. The next major development was the establishment of a knockout cup in 1871, based on the house competitions at Harrow School. These knockouts, in which most teams names are placed in a hat, and drawn out in pairs, then leading to a one-game knockout competition similar to the NCAA Championships, which culminates in a Cup trophy. When soccer first started in the United States, it was played primarily by schoolboy and college teams, and was largely an upper-class game.<query> when was soccer first played</query> The Oneida soccer club, formed in Boston in 1862 is often cited as the first soccer club to consist of a regular roster of players, as opposed to the pick-up games commonly played at the time. It consisted of a group of Boston secondary school students from fairly elite public schools in the area (Boston Latin, Boston English, etc.). This club would play matches against pickup teams throughout the Boston collegiate community and went undefeated, and unscored upon during their entire four-year existence. Apparently, teamwork, and familiarity with teammates was a significant factor in winning, and this was not lost on the public. The Oneida Football Club was the first soccer club anywhere outside of England, even predating the formation of Scottish teams. Clubs soon spread to other collegiate communities. The College Era, and Rules Consolidation, 1862-1875 Collegiate play resumed on a regular basis after the Civil War.<query> when was the oneida soccer team formed</query> The attention snowballed in a positive way this time, through 1976 and 1977. As attendance climbed and more world stars were signed, vital media attention drew record numbers of fans, culminating with 77,691 for a 1977 playoff game between the Cosmos and the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers at Giants stadium. This was a truly golden era. A key development through the 1970's was the rapid growth of soccer as a youth participation sport. Soccer was relatively inexpensive as well as democratic -- it did not require specialists, tall players or behemoths as many of the other sorts did, and youth soccer did not have the overly competitive stigma and the political mudslinging that was plaguing Little League baseball and Pop Warner football. The parallel growth of the NASL, and youth (as well as adult) soccer really portended a golden era for the sport in the US, which unfortunately was premature at least from the professional game's point of view.<query> when did soccer become a sport</query> Rules varied widely among different schools and communities; Princeton played with 25 players, some people even played a game with innings, with a victory going to the first team to score a fixed number of goals (a la volleyball). In 1866, Beadle & Company of New York published a set of rules for both Association Football (soccer) and the ""Handling game"" (Rugby). The first intercollegiate game using rules resembling modern game was played on November 7, 1869 in New Brunswick, NJ between Princeton and Rutgers (Rutgers won 6-4). This game used the London Football Association's 1863 rules which called for, among other things, 25 players, a field 110 meters x 70 meters, a 24 foot wide goal, movement of the ball allowed with all parts of the body (including hands, ball could be batted or held, but not carried or thrown).<query> when was the first football game</query> First team to score 6 points won. Interestingly, this same game is also generally recognized as the first GRIDIRON FOOTBALL game as well. Soccer was also taken up at this time by Yale, Columbia and Cornell, and reintroduced to Harvard in 1871 in a hybrid form known as the Boston Game, a version that also allowed the throwing and carrying of the ball. At this time, football was still played by a number of different and conflicting rules. In 1873, inspired by the English Football Association's rules unification, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, and Rutgers met in New York to draw up a uniform set of rules based on the London 1863 rules. They established 20 players on a team, a field measuring 400 feet x 250 feet, 25-foot wide goal, 6 goals to win, and a point scored by passing the goal past the goal posts.<query> when was football first played</query> Carrying the ball was prohibited. Shortly after the first game under these rules, a Yale victory over Princeton, an English team, the Eton Players visited New Haven and played Yale, to whom they lost 1-2, in the first Anglo-American international match. Yale was persuaded to adopt the English custom of 11 players to a side, and subsequently argued for its universal adoption, which was generally achieved by 1880. Meanwhile, Harvard had become more interested in the Rugby form of the game, and looked for competition against similarly oriented teams. When they happened upon McGill University of Montreal, who had also adopted those rules, the two teams played the first intercollegiate rugby match in 1874. The second of these games was played with an oval ball under English Rugby Association rules, and marks the evolution of soccer into the modern gridiron game.<query> when was rugby first played</query> A fateful event which would forever change the fortunes of American soccer took place in 1875 when Yale Harvard and bridged the game gap to play a match under special concessionary rules, which included both goals and tries (later touchdowns), and a 15 man roster. Harvard won 4 goals to none and 4 tries to none. Yale reassessed their position after this humiliation, and decided to adopt the Rugby code. Princeton, (who had watched the game as observers) were impressed enough to follow suit. In 1876, Harvard, Princeton and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football Association using Rugby rules. Stevens, Wesleyan and Penn soon followed, and the end of 1876 had signed the death knell signed for collegiate soccer in the US. The Working-Class and Immigrant Eras, 1875-1894 After the demise of college soccer, the game lay primarily in the hands of working-class communities, who were rapidly adopting the game, as the upper classes increasingly looked to rugby/gridiron.<query> when did college soccer start</query>"

All Primary Care Trusts are undertaking a process to separate these two functions completely, for which there are different approaches under guidance from Department of Health. The revised operating framework 2010/11 for the whole of the NHS, together with the publication of the recent White Paper further support the process named Transforming Community Services (TCS). In Northamptonshire the Primary Care Trust; NHS Northamptonshire has developed proposals for this separation by transferring those community services managed by NHS Northamptonshire Provider Services to other organisations to manage. This will ultimately mean that Provider Services will no longer exist. It is important to emphasise that the Transforming Community Services (TCS) process will result in no change to the services that patients and members of the public receive and access; including opening times or location.<query> what is tcs</query> The process is purely a change in the management of the community service and not a change to the service itself. It is proposed that the majority of the community services are transferred to Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS foundation Trust (NHfT), an organisation with extensive experience of working with a range of patients in a community setting. The rest of the community services are proposed for transfer to a number of other organisations including Kettering General Hospital, Northampton General Hospital, Out of Hours Service and Local Authority.

It is proposed to concentrate skills in new Specialist Centres which will have the most experienced and skilled staff working with the most modern equipment all in one place, providing the best treatment possible. Evidence shows that patients requiring urgent medical care have a better chance of survival and recovery if specialist experience and equipment is concentrated in one place. This will mean access to the best-quality, specialist care. On-going treatment and recovery can then be offered in a local hospital nearer to the patient's home. For some people, it might be quicker to go to their nearest A&E. However, this might not mean the best care. The best treatment and outcomes requires a team of skilled and experienced staff, with access to sophisticated equipment.<query> why is urgent care important</query> Specialist teams also need to treat several hundred patients each year to hone their skills and get the best results.

Our guests includeKip Wheeler and Darren Reiley, both graduate students at the University of Oregon and teachers of Freshman composition. We also have joining our discussion Dr. Kali Hassensprenger , anarcha-feminist and author of the controversial new book,Outside-In Education: Thus Assessment doth make Asses of us All. Finally we are also honored to have joining us today, the distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philology and Antiquities, Dr. E. M. W. Mustcrotchette . [ Host]: Now as I understand it, there has been an ongoing debate in English 608 concerning matters of anonymity in electronic classrooms.<query> anonymous classroom discussion</query> Assessing learning is a means of facilitating learning, if done appropriately. And how can we be sure that the actual facilitation of learning is going on in the anonymity of the collaborative project? If one student is failing to learn and needs constructive criticism, how will the teacher identify that student and provide the feedback the pupil needs, even desires? He will be lost in the anonymity of a collaborative project. I'm not sure all students share your ethical concern for being responsible to their peers. Even if the majority share that sense of responsibility, it only takes one bad apple who fails to contribute to a project to lessen its quality, and thus ruin or diminish the learning experience of all the other students who were relying upon him or her for a share of the work. I've never had a student suggest for himself or herself an average or below-average grade, even when the work was substandard by my judgment.<query> why is it important to assess learning</query> When students evaluate other students on the project, nine times out of ten, they agree that so-and-so did a marvelous or a horrible job. But about one time out of ten, I would receive conflicting evaluations: one student would write ""so-and-so really helped the group with x,"" but another student would write, ""so-and-so missed all our group meetings and didn't contribute anything until the night before the project was due."" Is it appropriate to trust the first student? The second student? To split the difference and mark the grade as ""C""? I would fear that (in my own case) the desire to let students assess themselves and each other in an anonymous, collaborative project would be casting aside my responsibilities as a teacher by foisting them on unsuspecting freshman.<query> why do students write conflicting evaluations</query> You said something at the beginning of that last bit there that struck me, Kip: that a ""bad apple"" not contributing as much to the group somehow diminishes the learning experience for the rest of the group. How? Seems to me that such an experience enhances the learning value. It may lessen the final product, but it's theprocess that's important in group activities anyway-- at least for me. And that seems to get to the heart of the issue in general. A process-oriented pedagogy stresses the road, not the destination. It emphasizes the importance of learning techniques, not figuring out ways to please an authority figure to get a good grade. And since the best thing we can teach our students is how to learn and critique themselves, I find it important to encourage my students to evaluate themselves based on standards that we determine as a group. But, (I see your brow furrowing, Kip) I realize that often we are bound to assign grades authoritatively to our students, as is the case for Composition Instructors at the U of O, when they can't seem to do it responsibly themselves, but I would argue that those cases are rare .<query> why is process oriented pedagogy important</query> When I have assigned collaborative projects-- with which I've had a great deal of success, I would add-- I make my students turn in a written evaluation of both their own contributions to the projects, and of the contributions of each other member. That keeps it fair I would like to know what your secret is, Darren. The few times I've tried collaborative projects, I've also had students turn in written evaluations of their own work and that of their partners. (I must admit I've only tried the process two or three times, then gave it up in disgust; if you've been doing it for awhile, you may have developed some helpful tricks to make it work). As teachers, I know we feel a certain responsibility to make sure that students receive as accurate an evaluation of their work as possible-- Speak for yourself Adam!<query> what is the purpose of a collaborative project</query> You're so top-heavy I feel like I'm leaning! I know that grading carries with it a certain ideological bias. To a degree, it is subjective in nature, I will grant you. I'm not sure that doing away with evaluating the individual and instead evaluating a collective group of students solves that problem. In my past experience, collaborative projects have always been nightmares, both for my students and for me as a grader. It's another form of anonymity because I am often unable to assess fairly who contributed what in the larger project. If an online project includes an extraordinary annotated bibliography, which student did that part? Or did each student contribute one or two articles? Who is responsible for that outstanding collection of slides during the class presentation? That person deserves special commendation. However, what about the student that failed to turn in his share of the work, or the one that ignored his section of the assignment, forcing Susie to do two parts?<query> why is it important to evaluate the individual in a project</query> So much of the work in collaborative assignments takes place out of class, and I cannot observe all that goes into its construction. In our 608 readings, we have an essay written collaboratively by multiple authors under a single pen-name Myka Vielstimmig. In the concluding footnotes, it was clear that the writing group responsible often shifted in its membership from one publication to the next. To me, that creates disturbing possibilities. Suppose the early members of such a collaborative project publish fantastic materials. Later, the group's composition changes. Imagine someone under the group's pen-name then publishes a work with grotesque errors in citation, or makes a claim that turns out to be patently false, and becomes the laughingstock of the academic discourse community. Will that stigma attach itself (unfairly) to those earlier members who published under the same pen-name, but had no part in the later projects?<query> what is the purpose of a collaborative writing group</query> Having your name attached to something keeps you honest. Maybe it's just Foucauldian influences at work, but if our intellectual work can be linked back to us, it may keep us honest, and give us a stake in producing the best intellectual work possible. From these comments, it sounds like you place a great deal of importance on intellectual property. Is that true? Yes. And Darren thinks it would be useful to break that paradigm? Well, yes, actually I do, but I'm not wholly committed to the issue. As a writer and poet myself, I have a sort of egoistic desire to be congratulated for mywork, to be rewarded for my ideas, as it were. But that's really not where I see the issue that Kip just mentioned: that is, the issue of assessing a collaborative project.<query> why is intellectual property important</query> I think he makes a good point about the members of the group known collectively as Myka Vielstimmig--that a sloppy member could discredit the name of the whole group, but again, I would stress the importance of the discourse community and the natural checks that members of a community hold each other to. As for assessing a group.... What do you make of the recent court injunction against napster , in which anonymous individuals can go online and download materials protected under copyright? I myself am in favor of something like the potential of Napster. Here, we have various forms of art readily available to the public in a way never possible before. Horse piddle, I say. You must have hippie leanings also, in spite of your minimal coiffure. Mr. Mustcrotchette-- That's Professor Mustcrotchette! Does nobody in this room have a sense of copyright history ?<query> what is napster</query> Shortly before the French Revolution in the late eighteenth-century, the French abolished copyright laws, if you will recall. Their ideals were the same as those discussed here--eliminating the idea of individual intellectual ownership so that the greater community could freely share these materials. It was disastrous! Artists, writers, and musicians often had to drastically cut back their production of literature and art, because it was no longer feasible for them to support themselves through the sale of such items. Imagine Voltaire, if you will, being forced literally to tend his garden in order to avoid starvation! Bootlegged copies of printed materials flooded the market. And fifteen years later, the Republic voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the copyright laws after the disastrous experiment. Those fools like you who lament the loss of Napster and bemoaning the fact the law won't let you commit acts of intellectual piracy at your whim.<query> why did the copyright laws become illegal</query> Taking another work and reproducing it without credit is theft, plain and simple. --Professor Mustcrotchette, I don't think the two are comparable. Copyright laws specifically are designed to prevent individuals from selling and making financial profit by reproducing another's work without permission. Yes, Napster might potentially hurt the profits of big record-companies. But it isn't stealing from them. The people using the Napster website before the court injunction weren't taking their copies and selling them on the street for a profit, they were giving them away freely to whoever wanted a copy. Yes, that might have deleterious effects on music sales, but I'm sure giving away free food would also have deleterious effects on restaurants, and that doesn't mean the act should be outlawed. Boy that's a great example of an upstanding model to emulate there, Robespierre, the French Revolutionaries!<query> why is napster stealing</query> How exactly would you describe your concerns? [Kip]: It's primarily an issue that has arisen between Darren and myself. We both want our students to excel at writing in an on-line environment, and in many classes teachers have their students use ""handles"" or alternate identities in on-line discussions. As an undergraduate myself, I was a student in such a classroom at West Texas State University, using the handle ""Matilda the Hun."" The idea is that students who would otherwise be too shy to speak in class would feel more comfortable expressing their honest opinions in a real debate if their identity remains concealed. In my experience, both as a student and a teacher, it does seem to have that effect in the short-term, and I understand the value that might bring. Sometimes by wearing masks, we create a space where we feel more free to express ourselves.<query> why do students wear masks</query> Ha! We all know how dedicated they were to justice and individual rights. If Napster were selling the materials on its website without the permission of the artist or owner, I would agree that the act was piracy. But there is no law against sharing. It's sort of like one person buying a big television set, a DVD player, andJurassic Park, then inviting eighty or so thousand friends to come over and watch it with him. As long he's not charging them any money, he isn't violating copyright in any way I can see. In the same way, Napster is like an individual purchasing a music CD, burning five-thousand copies, and then giving them away at the corner of the block to whoever wants a copy. There's no law against giving gifts freely, at your own expense.<query> is napster a copyright</query> The original donors to Napster all had to legally purchase their first copy before they could alter it to MP3 format. Only then was it possible to place it on the net for others to share. I think its important that the original artist's name be attached to such duplicated files, so individuals do not try to take an Alanis Morisette CD, replace her name with another, and change the title. Shouldn't we return to classroom discussion? To students? But this event does relate directly to students. Academic equivalents to this newfangled Napster contraption will appear, copies of scholarly works on-line, student essays on-line. 'Ere now, we already 'ave that, don't we now? It's called the internet, and your students will be a usin' it, and are a usin' it, mark me words, lads.<query> why is napster important</query> The intelligent thing would be to steer students away from the internet, too, before the ease of accessing materials anonymously and then stamping a name falsely on the first page contributes to the increasingly philistine nature of modern culture. These problems would be greatly lessened if we stuck with time-proven, approved means of publications like books and print. No, we shouldn't try to discourage such new technology. We should instead teach our students to make use of it responsibly. If we don't do that, there are two possible outcomes I can see on a wider social level when it comes to copyright protection. Those government agencies in charge of enforcing copyright laws will undertake a sort of prohibition-style approach. Their attempts will ultimately prove either infeasible or feasible, and either way, the result will be negative.<query> why do we discourage copyright protection</query> Suppose it turns out to be infeasible to completely stop Napster-like groups on-line, but only to nab an occasional offender. What would the result look like? Thefederales run a few stings to nab the Napsters, but each time they knock down a website of that sort, a Gnutella or Nutunes will pop up to take its place. We'll end up with sporadically enforced crackdowns that will result in occasional arrests, but not prevent the trend. Recording and publishing industries will sue whoever they think they can get money from, and the equivalent of virtual speak-easies will pop up on the net where people using aliases will swap the material as they will. If the music/writing/art swapping movement is forced underground, the odds increase that these sites, forced to swap files at some risk to themselves, will begin to charge users to download such stuff.<query> what is the result of napsters</query> The price would be less than what record-companies are charging now, of course, but I suspect the flowering of illegal copies will supersede the sharing model. The days of free-exchange, of sharing files, may be over. If users can't legally share your music files on-line in an open manner, we create a profitable niche for music bootleggers to secretly undercut prices. I think human generosity will end at the point people run the risk of fines or prison. The second possibility is even worse, I think. There may be a way to effectively and completely monitor the web for illegal copies that requires very little manpower. That is digital watermarking, a practice some museums and graphic designers are already experimenting with in their online materials. Copyright holders might mark all their files with code that functions like a combination of metatags and cookies.<query> why is it illegal to share music files</query> Every month or two, they send out the equivalent of a spider or a 'bot to search the web for copies of that file--perhaps an image of Mickey Mouse, perhaps the Nike swoosh, or an MP3 File of AC/DC's latest song, or a Stephen King novel. Each image or file contains within its coding a hidden virtual watermark. The spider or 'bot then check to see if the copy was legally obtained. If not, the program notes the computer and its unique numeric address. Checking that against registration, the legal copyright owners might then be able to send a bill to that computer's owner, or call the police, or whatnot. That's too Orwellian for my taste, too 1984-ish. But the potential is there. It is being developed. The only way to prevent commercial interests from researching and creating such products is for the internet community to police itself.<query> what is the purpose of a copyright spider</query> Those writers, artists, scholars, who put a lot of work into a project--in some cases years or even decades--deserve recognition (and yes, maybe even payment) for that work. If we don't instill in our students a strong sense of intellectual property, and a sense of ethics concerning such matters, they will probably continue the cycle of copyright breach. In turn, that will encourage writers, artists, and publishers to use such Draconian, Orewellian measures to monitor computer-users. Exactly the stance I would expect from a white male doctoral candidate (you can hide behind your green font all you want, but I can see your real color!) Intellectual property rights are there to protect the elitephysical property holders, and no one else. Vandana Shiva once told me a story of a graduate student in Chemistry who worked for years with a professor to develop a technique for genetically coding a seed so that it wouldn't reproduce.<query> why is intellectual property important</query> A procedure invented, by the way, so that farmers would have to buy the seeds every year and become increasingly reliant upon the company that ""owns"" the seed. Anyway, if the seed itself were not sinister enough, the professor insisted on being the primary name under which they published their work-- for better credibility, he claimed. Then, when the graduate student-- who had collaborated on inventing the procedure, mind you-- tried to use the procedure for his own individual work, the professor had him arrested for copyright infringement. There's your recognition, for you. Such laws protect the rich and the privileged; they do not ensure recognition for work. AskNicola Tesla about that one. I really would like to turn this discussion back to the classroom. What dangers or benefits do you see in the adoption of multiple or imaginary personas?<query> why was the seed procedure invented</query> One tendency is that the discussion might tend to wander. Each persona ""wants"" to say something, and that something may or may not be on the topic at hand. I see. There is a cure for that though. Bart Beaudin, a Professor of Adult Education at Colorado State University, has proposed a list oftechniques to prevent the discussion from wandering. It's not an insurmountable problem. Again, there's also that hurly-burly about a virtual rape inLambdaMOO a few years back. One danger is that personas will get out of control, engage in antisocial or disruptive activities within an electronic environment. Richard MacKinnon at the University of Texas at Austin ""witnessed"" the verbal assault. He noted in his article on the event that ""a persona lacks accountability for its actions"" when ""utility to the user or a 'stake' is absent"" (""Virtually Unaccountable"").<query> what is the danger of personas</query> Even here at this university, two years ago on an e-mail list, we had such an incident that even made the pages ofThe Emerald. In that case, it wasn't even a matter of being completely anonymous so much as being in a faceless environment that encouraged a student to make remarks that would never have been tolerated inmy classroom. I haven't noticed that sort of disruption so much in the classes I have taught myself, but I did notice that as an undergraduate student at another university. In a course on creative writing, the teacher had us post short stories on the Daedalus Exchange, and then in real-time swap feedback with each other. Both the author and the evaluators used pseudonyms. At least one individual used this virtual space as an arena for obnoxious and disruptive behavior. He (or maybeshe, but I suspect a he) went by the handle ""Connie Lingus"" in some sessions, or ""Phil Lasheo"" in others.<query> what is the name of the anonymous person who used a virtual space to discuss a story [Mustcrochette]: Like Prince Hal and his cloak in Henry V, I assume? As I understand Darren's position, Darren thinks-- (mutters) That long-haired neo-hippy. I'm sorry, what was that? (coughs) Just clearing my throat. Do go on. Precisely. My worry is that, rather than encouraging students to speak for themselves, in the long run we may create the opposite effect. Students may become so used to expressing themselves behind a protective, electronic disguise, that they ultimately feel even more uncomfortable when it comes time to taking a public stand on issues they feel strongly about by joining group debate, or publishing writing, or participating in other forms of discourse. We need to instill in them a habit of attaching their own names to their own thinking.<query> who is darren in henry v</query> The teacher deliberately set up the system preferences in the beginning of the term so that not even the instructor would ever know who was using which nickname. (The only comment the instructor made to the disruptive student was, ""Phil, your nickname sucks."") The teacher's philosophy was that the students would police themselves. To a certain extent, we did. We cajoled and insulted Connie/Phil mercilessly whenever he stepped out of line, until eventually the user stopped using those two monikers and appeared with a different handle on the Daedalus Exchange. I wonder, however, if you actually did gain something productive from that experience. The class as a whole learned how to shut down a disruptive influence by their collective will, independently from an official authority figure's intervention. Surely that sort of lesson is worthwhile in and of itself? Perhaps so.<query> what is the meaning of the nickname phil</query> I hadn't really thought of it that way. However, it took about half the semester for this to occur, and recidivism exploded in the last week of class. We all felt it was really the teacher's job to step in and shut down that sort of disruption, not our job. Over the course of the semester, we must have wasted hours in dealing with Connie/Phil. This is an example of why I think its important for the facilitator to play an active part in these virtual discussion groups. If it had been me running the MOO, I would probably have tried to determine earlier if Phil's participation was offensive to the group, and then intervened if that were the case. Exactly the same as if it were any listserv dialogue. Besides, I think another important element to Freshman Writing courses is encouraging students to find authority in arguments and reasoning, not in some meaningless hierarchy of age or privilege conferred by the Institution. Something I think few graduate student/teachers really consider. Rubbish.<query> why is it important to have a facilitator in a discussion group</query> Absolute rubbish. It would have been much faster if the teacher could identify which student was being disruptive and stopped him during the first session. We have authority figures for a reason. Sometimes it is more ethical to silence one student's voice so that others may speak. I'm certain that members of this younger generation of teachers are all too lily-livered to admit the unpleasant fact, but truth is truth. Teachers have the responsibility to give students a timely and efficient education. In this example, out of misplaced desire to decentralize the classroom, the teacher ended up wasting several hours of how many students' time? Twenty? Thirty? All to avoid stepping on one miscreant's ego? All to give this philistine the freedom to be insulting and disruptive? Authority simply won't work unless everyone knows who the authority-figure is.<query> why do teachers have authority figures</query> Who is the authority-figure in a virtual environment, then? (If we need such a thing.) Out of all the speakers here, I think my rank and distinguished publications speak for themselves, as well as my honors from Wittenberg University. The authority-figure certainly isn't you, Mr. Wheeler. Or Mr. Reiley for that matter. The way you are dithering here assures me of that, quite clearly. But in a virtual environment, I don't think it's that clear. For instance, perhaps Darren has logged on as ""Kip"" and is using my name. Or maybe I am using his. Or maybe we are alternating every other message between names. There is no necessary correlation between the name that appears in the discussion list and the writer. In a virtual environment, identities can be always appropriated by others.<query> who is the authority figure in a virtual environment</query> I could log-on with the handle of ""Anne Laskaya,"" head of the Composition Program, or as John Gage, head of the English Department. It might instill a reticence in the other writers on the discussion list to see a pronouncement from some writer labeled ""jgage."" In effect, it would be too easy to steal auctoritas from another scholar, or set up straw-men to be knocked down. [jgage]: He's absolutely right, but it is still an unethical misappropriation of identity. And the students involved in an on-line debate might choose to play it safe, on the off-chance that the person pretending to be me really is me. How can we form a discourse community, or trace a logical argument to a conclusion unless we have a clear sense of who is in that discourse community? Yes, How do rhetoricians adapt for an audience when we are uncertain to whom speak?<query> who is jgage</query> How do we arrive at shared assumptions with individuals who don't really exist? How do we produce a real debate when individuals can shift personas, pretend they hold view they don't, or refuse to take responsibility for something a persona says? But aren't you doing so now? Aren't we producing a debate, even if the audience, and the other writers aren't sure who is really writing what? I've also noted that we have far more speakers here than we have writers, at least according to my roll-sheet. Some of the people speaking here must have adapted personas. That concerns me too Look here, Hosty, don't try to play like you're not a fictional character, we all know thegreenguy is controlling what you say. But we all know that Derrida has shown exhaustively that all identities are socially constructed fictions anyway, so let's address the real issue ofstudents adapting to an audience.<query> who is adapting personas</query> It's not the upper echelons of the rhetorical elite we're here to discuss, now is it? 'Ere now. Mebee credit's not the point at all, 'ere. Mebee a valid argument's a good argument no matter whare it 'riginally popped out, what? Why does anybody need credit for it at all, now? That's argumentum ad 'ominem, it is. My dear sir, you must be a half-wit. Go and mate with the village idiot, and perhaps your children can achieve full status as complete morons. What would be the point in creating such fictions? If a fictional character makes a subtle or powerful argument, and everyone loves it, how will the real author ever get credit for it? When the publication is complete, who obtains the recognition, the line on the c.v., so to speak?<query> why does anybody need credit for mebee</query> But remember Rob Howard's discussion of the Storm Front website. Recall the exercise in which he showed his class an argumentative essay from this Neo-Nazi website without revealing the source? The essay argued in favor of the formation of white student groups in high schools. The students in Rob's class all agreed with the argument, and then were horrified when Rob showed them the source. Here's a case where the origin of an idea is important, both for understanding an underlying ideological purpose in proposing the argument, and for recognizing the potential for rhetorical damage if a writer were to treat this material with the same amount of credibility we might give a different source. Suppose a student were to repeat that argument while being ignorant of the source. However, some members of his reading audience recognizes its origin. The audience might then equate the student with the Storm Front racial supremacist movement.<query> why is the origin of an idea important</query> It's not safe to disregard the source of an idea. That's an important point for students to understand, so they can avoid being manipulated by sources with commercial or political biases. True, but that student would also be held accountable for those ideas by his or her discourse community after the fact, and the repercussions for recapitulating Storm Front's arguments would very likely teach him or her to look more carefully next time. And that's exactly the point! This entire discussion has been based (I think) on an assumption that the writing class, or the collaborative or anonymous experiment, is a self-contained entity. And we’ve been trying to ferret out all of the political and ideological ramifications within that entity itself--which is important I grant you. But a writing class goes far beyond the ten weeks in which it exists in time, and the most important element to such a class is not the final grade or even the concrete product students turn in at the end, but the rhetorical and critical skill they carry away with them.<query> why is it important to write a class</query> In the case of the Stormfront essay, Rob’s students learned an invaluable lesson: NOT that intellectual property is important to hold the author responsible, or even that we have to know precisely the origin of an argument (although I would never say that's not important). The lesson is that we must learn to examine the rhetoric of a piece closely, in order to explore all of the implications of an argument in terms of what is being implied and the assumptions upon which it rests. We won’t always be certain of the origin of an argument, or even who crafted it--that is the reality of the internet. But that doesn't mean we should outlaw it, or shrink from creating anonymous for a in which students have to deal with these ramifications. On the contrary, the gradual disappearance of the author is not simply an ideological stance that I’m espousing--it is an inevitable result of the internet-- --and of the increasing power of a Police State-- ...and it is therefore imperative that we teach our students to look at a text with these critical skills intact.<query> why is it important to know the origin of an argument</query> The best way to ensure that people are responsible and honest in their research and publication is to ensure that the writing is linked to a specific name, on whom readers and listeners can appropriately heap credit or blame. That may seem a bit Foucauldian, but it's valuable. [Jeerer in the crowd]: 'E called him a right long-'aired 'ippy, 'e did. I 'eard it with me own two ears. My dear sir, you must be mistaken. Do go on, Mr. Wheeler. And if you've got something to say, Il Duce, either say it to the group or keep it zipped! I'm sorry, I've lost my train of thought with these disruptive personas. Maybe I should let Darren speak for himself here. Darren? [Darren]: I've got two points to make here Kip, the first of which concerns this issue of students, or writers in general, being held responsible for their work.<query> who is responsible for writing</query> [HECKLER] But, Joor just dodgink the issue again, YesNo? Le students need to see le Ouebsite to understand the racisme, eh? Exactly. In a truly anonymous on-line environment, in which the argument or final-product appears unattached to any organization or name, the students in Rob's class would never be able to make the connection Rob revealed by placing the argument back in authorial context. Without seeing Storm-Front website, the reader would never know she was perpetuating and supporting the arguments of a Neo-Nazi group. The only reason the students would learn the lesson about knowing the source you quote is because Rob took the time to pull away the veil of anonymity and show them the organization responsible behind the essay. The students may be a bit more suspicious about quoting a source without analyzing it first, (which is definitely a good thing), but thereason they are now more suspicious is they have learned the link between argument and author.<query> why do students need to see storm front</query> Bah, joor just all agreeing with each other now. Pooey! What about the possibilities of play? It strikes me that creating anonymity via personas has a particular appeal in the imaginative aspect of writing. It creates a space for role-playing even as its members enjoin in intellectual debate. (snorts) Like children? We seek to produce intellectually mature adults here, not pander to the adolescent impulse. I found the Vielstimmig essay to be loads of fun, and I imagine the authors enjoyed crafting it, and yet, they are all mature adults, and what's more, they used the playfulness to achieve a particularly rhetorical, pseudo-hypertextual, effect. Rubbish! Horse Hockey! You're skating on thin ice with me, there, CrustMotchette! For me, the aspect of play is the one advantage of anonymity that gives me no moral qualms.<query> what is the playfulness of vielstimmig essay</query> As a contributor to this collaborative on-line project, it has been tremendous fun to explore an argument by taking on various personas. I'd consider anonymity in the early stages of an on-line, classroom discussion. Maybe during the first day of debate. But after students have had their fun and games, and tried out various writing styles and authorial voices, I would want the debate eventually to move back into discourse where everyone knows who is speaking. The only disturbing part is that the personas do take on a life of their own, after a while. I feel the same way. Wait a minute--you are the persona, aren't you? And I'm the author? Poppycock. I'm as real as you are. Only Ms. Hassensprenger is an artificial construct, as is easily discernible by her ridiculous name.<query> who is the author of the poem</query> I created her as a composite of the Indian Death Goddess (Kali) and-- Nobody can say I didn't warn him. Disparage the Goddess at your own peril, Musketcrotch, your days of flaccid patriarchal privilege are over! [Grips the podium and shatters it over Mustcrotchette's back] Note how the Kestrel always shrieks just before it dives for the kill.... You want a piece of me too Frenchie LaRouche? I'll be there as soon as I'm done with Crusty! [Takes Mustcrotchette in a headlock] I say! Stop that! Who's responsible for making them stop? I... I'm not sure. [sound of sirens and jackboots on pavement] [voice via bullhorn]: ""This riot will desist immediately. This is the Reality Police, Verisimilitude Squad. You are under arrest for disorderly conduct in an academic environment."" Show some id first.<query> who is responsible for making them stop</query> Who are you? ""Lieutenant Tiller. Verisimilitude Squad. You're under arrest also, Hessensprenger, for assaulting an eminent scholar. Come quietly or there will be . . . trouble."" [blubbering]: Officer, it wasn't my fault at all. It was her! She's a madwoman. She doesn't even wear makeup! She-- Tell it to the judge, Mr. Fancy-Tweed-Suit-With-Arm-Patches. [sweetly] He prefers Doctor Fancy-Tweed-Suit, actually. I'm sure all of the students who had to drop out of school because of your elitist standards will enjoy seeing you in the joint, you pompous...[BEEP!] And so concludes our virtual conference. I wish there were time to field questions from the audience, but I'd be afraid who would appear even if we did.<query> who is lieutenant tiller</query> Please join us here next month when Doctors Brazen Brackenblood and Stacey Synecdoche will take on poet/activist Briathar Kinesi in a real-time animated presentation entitled ""Sufferin' Semaphore: The Net, The Blob, and the Emptied Signifier"" Thank you...

Partially I agree with you, Kip, at least about the danger of students becoming reliant on electronic masks, as you put it, and then becoming increasingly reluctant to speak out in person. Because of this danger, I would never rely solely on such an approach. Using anonymous or pseudonymous standpoints from which to voice opinions is a tool for empowering students to speak when they might not otherwise, for allowing students the opportunity to try out some of their more fringe ideas without fearing the feeling like they’ll be pounced on for them. This is a case in which I think it can be productive to remove the accountability. If students have a persona through which they can try out problematic positions, the discourse community (of which the facilitator is an important part) will then offer its responses to that idea and hopefully point out the problems with it. The student will then have been able to see the problems with the argument, without feeling shamed to have said something “stupid.” Without that shield, many student think these problematic positions but never voice them out of fear, and therefore never have the opportunity to work them out. [Hassensprenger]: I would take that one step further, and challenge this neo-Fascist and extremely phallo-centric ideology that wants to own everything, and that has resulted in a brand of identity politics that insists on identifying Self by distinguishing from Other.<query> why use pseudonymous viewpoints</query> This is the basis of a patriarchal system that we're talking about here-- a system that feels that it must maintain an established hierarchy of Grader and Graded, and that is predicated on a Capitalist and elitist need to reward the ""good workers"" [making derisive quotes in the air with her fingers] rather than encouraging people to feel an intrinsic investment in the work they produce. [Host]: Well then, what about student collaborative projects? I believe Darren has expressed some interest in such projects? [Darren]: I truly believe that this whole insistence on tying an idea to a particular individual is not only conceptually problematic, in a Foucauldian sense, but completely neglects the natural checks that members of a community place upon each other. If students work collaboratively, they will, if properly encouraged, parcel out duties, hold each other to the work and hopefully maintain a dialogue that in effect keeps each individual member responsible for what he or she contributes.<query> what is collaborative work</query> If one person is slacking, then the group has the option of expelling that member from the group. In fact, I would contend that collaborative work actually encourages a greater sense of responsibility rather than a lesser: I know for myself that I work harder when a group is depending upon me than if it is only myself that will be called to task. It is true that I may not be giving sufficient credit to the discourse community's ability to check individual members. Richard MacKinnon, who wrote about an act ofvirtual rape on LambdaMOO, noted that the group collectively came up with a virtual punishment for a deviant member, but questioned whether such self-policing is sufficient or ""mattered"" when only a persona is punished, not the person responsible. I think Susan Romano's article dealt particularly well with this issue also. She maintained that giving students the opportunity to challenge their notions of identity can provide a very liberating experience for students and instructors alike.<query> who wrote about virtual rape on lambdamoo</query> But she also emphasizes the need for what she calls ""rhetorical authority"" which amounts to the kind of monitoring that Kip and I both appear to favor. Though her critique is more focused on the ways in which women's voices become overpowered and suppressed by male privilege even in such pseudonymous virtual settings, I think her argument fits into this context as well. But Kip, you were referring to issues of student self-assessment, right? You're too damn soft Reiley! This fascist is only barely veiling his misogyny. The whole basis for a grading system goes right back to Adam being granted the privilege of naming everything in the world. It is a topdown system of ordering that is held in place to separate drones from soldiers, and workers from worked-for. It is obvious that the Academy's sad dependence on ""evaluating"" students [derisive finger-quotes] is nothing more than a vestige of this androcentric and Christyrannical mythos, and one that has become far more harmful than productive.<query> why is the grading system so bad</query> Its most apparent result is that students are only interested in receiving good grades rather than feeling inherently driven to create good work. They're only secondarily interested in learning new skills or discovering the true process of inquiry; their primary concern is figuring out how to do as little as possible to get a B or-- even more rare-- an A. So I ask you WHY?! Why this insistence on evaluating everything. Why can't the students hold themselves responsible for what they produce, and why can't the teacher's job be to facilitate, not to assess? This is the part of Kali's book that I agree with the most. In my experience, students have developed this Outside-In mentality towards their work. Removing the emphasis on individual performance and extrinsic rewards of that performance can only encourage students to seek a more lasting, intrinsic meaning to their work. But Miss Hassensprenger, why create an artificial division between facilitating learning and assessing it?<query> why is it important to facilitate learning</query>"

In America and Canada, on the other hand, the tables are turned. Espresso refers to coffee that is made by forcing a high pressure shot of hot water through very finely ground coffee.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Incandescent Lightbulbs Are Banned! Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. By admin on January 8, 2012 in Bans, Big Government, Canada, Europe, Government Control, Green, United States Image via Wikipedia It is now 2012, and the ban on incandescents in the United States has started. Many other countries have their own bans either already in place or planned. Canada was planned to start in 2012, but has delayed the ban due to environmental concerns over the disposal of compact fluorescents (CFLs).<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> Environmental protection is much easier to control at the utility level rather than at the personal level. Thus, your personal exposure is much smaller. Getting around the ban Image via Wikipedia As far as I know, it is not illegal to actually own Â incandescent lighting. It may be more difficult to obtain the bulbs, but once you have them, you can use them. In countries such as Germany,Â incandescents are now sold as “heat lamps”. You just have to love the ingenuity of entrepreneurs in serving legitimate consumer choice. They are even donating part of the proceeds to saving the forests, for the environmentally inclined. Americans, if you want to buy incandescents, then Canada could be an option for you! Just be aware that it is still illegal to import these bulbs into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs this year.<query> are incandescent lights illegal</query> Yes, light bulbs now belong to the same category as illegal drugs and weapons! What a sad world that this has come to.Â When did we allow the government this degree of control over our lives? My personal thoughts on the ban I can’t believe they would actually ban this icon of history. TheÂ incandescent bulbÂ is an example of ingenuity and progress, and has always been used to represent bright ideas. Should we start drawing CFLs over people’s heads in comic strips? The arguments against the bulb is that it is inefficient, but this is a subjective opinion. If you live in a country like Canada where it is cold most of the year, the heat emitted by these bulbs is no waste at all. At the same time, the quality of light is also a subjective factor. Should we start banning high-end nVidia graphics cards and 2000 watt baseboard heaters because they, too, consume “a lot” of energy?<query> why do light bulbs need to be banned</query> Why not force everyone to keep their home temperatures to a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius in the winter? Surely anything more is “wasteful”, and people can always toss on an extra sweater. I am not against avoiding waste and protecting the environment. I turn down my heat in the winter and I take public transportation. I close lights when I am not in the room, and I drive a 4 banger on the weekends. I am willing to bet that I consume far less energy than the typical home. If there is a problem with energy usage and pollution, then the proper scope to address that is at the utility level. Banning incandescents does not address the problem; it only makes a scapegoat out of a perfectly legitimate consumer good and harms consumer choice. What happened to consumer choice? Image via Wikipedia I have nothing against others purchasing and using CFLs, so long as they dispose of them properly, but I believe that it is a personal choice that should be made by each consumer, and not imposed top-down by the government.<query> what is the limit on incandescent lights</query> Incandescent light bulbs do use energy, but so do 1000 other things like electric baseboard heaters, coffee makers, and computers.Â Only the consumer is best equipped to make the decisions with her money that best apply to her situation. I have used and still use CFLs, but the light quality makes me physically ill. I will only use them for garage and patio lights and things like that, where I can decide for myself that they have utility. For everywhere else, I prefer incandescents, and maybe in the future I’ll give LEDs a try, if they also have a healthy color spectrum. That is my choice.

Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban. Forest January 8, 2012 at 2:54 pm # I don’t know if I would call them a ‘perfectly legitimate consumer good’ because there are a lot of faults in them.<query> why are incandescent lights banned</query> That being said it does not mean the energy savers are much better environmentally and in other ways (yes often the light from them is terrible but they are getting better). Long term the ‘legal’ bulbs are cheaper, in my experience, so from that aspect it could be a good move and it could help lower the USA’s energy output…. We’ll have to see the data after a few years. I’d be surprised if during the winter the heat from the bulbs significantly lowered heating bills so I am not sure that argument flies, again the data needs to be crunched somewhere. Ad for the ban, it is kind of silly. A possible better option would have been a tax on the bulbs which was used to bring down the cost of the energy savers but I know you are already cringing at that idea!!!!<query> why are light bulbs banned</query> Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 3:03 pm # Hey Forest, I am glad that we both believe that a ban is completely silly! There are faults in everything, but I call them a “perfectly legitimate consumer good” because on a voluntary free market, many people would still prefer to buy them. People weigh the faults and trade-offs in different consumer goods, and choose what makes the most sense. I do not have hard data on how much I save in heating from incandescents, but I can feel the heat being given off and I am sure that most of that heat is not simply being “wasted”, as is often implied. I think that LEDs can become a real viable alternative down the road. They have long lifespans, and they are capable of accurate color spectrum reproduction.<query> why are led lights considered legitimate</query> Perhaps not as smooth as incandescents, but far superior to fluorescents, and without the ultraviolet and mercury problems of fluorescents. There are very legitimate health reasons for choosing incandescents over CFLs, and there are perfectly legitimate subjective reasons as well. Who is anyone else to tell me that I am “wrong” for preferring incandescents? Likewise, others can buy CFLs, but I still think that they should dispose of them properly. Thanks for the great comment! Reply Forest January 8, 2012 at 3:19 pm # Of course, I completely forgot about LED lights, we have had that conversation before. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:26 pm # I’ll have a follow-up post soon on why CFLs suck, but LEDs can be a great viable option. Reply Darwin's Money January 8, 2012 at 4:49 pm # I’ve always liked seeing the free market dictate consumer behavior and force anachronistic technologies out of business.<query> why do people prefer incandescent lights over led lights</query> I don’t feel the benefits of newer bulbs are compelling enough to basically “outlaw” production and sale of incandescents. But, it probably scored points with the green movement. So, I guess we’re all relegated to higher cost bulbs with theoretical life-spans that we hope will pan out financially. Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:25 pm # Great comment, Darwin. This is a clear example where the arguments for a ban just don’t pass muster. Even if CFLs are more “efficient” on a lumens-output model, that certainly doesn’t account for the differences in quality of lighting nor many other factors. The beauty of a voluntary free market is that it CAN account for all of these factors, perhaps not perfectly, but in a way that much more closely reaches what customers actually want. Reply 101 Centavos January 8, 2012 at 5:11 pm # Just bought a few more boxes of incandescent bulbs today.<query> why do we ban incandescent bulbs</query> I suppose that makes me a hoarder, but I need the heat output to keep the water pipes from freezing in the well house. I remember as a kid playing around with mercury globules, when thermometers would break. Who knew…? Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 5:32 pm # Hah! Well, you didn’t seem to suffer for it! I’m gonna be stocking up on more incandescents too, while I can. Apparently the Czech President recommended stockpiling enough to last a lifetime. That might be a bit excessive, but I will wait until LEDs or something better becomes affordable. I have no interest in joining the CFL bandwagon; I’ve been there and I didn’t enjoy it. Reply Moneycone January 8, 2012 at 7:16 pm # Nice coverage FG! A number of cities were early adopters of LED bulbs for the traffic lights.<query> why do we need more led lights</query> What are the phase-out plans like all over the world? Canada Canada has decided toÂ back downÂ from its plan to ban incandescents in 2012. The reasons cited are that there is a disposal problem with CFLs due to the mercury content, which poses an environmental hazard. The ban is still planned for 2014, so if you want to stock up on incandescents, then now is the time. China China will begin to phase out incandescent light bulbs beginning this October, and will continue to progressively ban lower and lower-wattage bulbs as time goes on. The ban will be complete by 2016. European Union The phasing-out of incandescent bulbs in the European Union is scheduled to be completed this year. United Kingdom Most incandescent bulbs are already banned in the UK; the venerable 40w will also suffer its demise this year.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned in the us</query> When it came out each bulb cost something like $400 as opposed to incandescents which were 1/10th the price! This was fine till winter struck! See, with incandescents, the heat side effect kept these lights clear from snow build-ups, but no such luck with LEDs, which ran much cooler! I found this a fascinating adverse effect of modern technology! (And hey, thanks for the mention!) Reply admin January 8, 2012 at 8:52 pm # Oh yeah at least half of the traffic lights around here use LEDs now. I think that is an application that makes a lot of sense! No snow problems because I guess the fixture itself is designed to prevent that problem (I live in Canada where we get a lot of snow ).

Reply Miss T @ Prairie Eco-Thrifter January 9, 2012 at 3:16 pm # New technology isn’t always the answer. I am all for being green but we have to do it smartly. Yes, I too live in Canada and LED’s aren’t all they are cracked up to be for our climate. There is something to be said for the heat output of incandescents. Plus, like you say, what are we going to do with all of the bulbs that are still working right?<query> where are you buying led bulbs</query> Throwing them away is just plain wasteful. I am all for improvements but lets be smart about this. Reply admin January 9, 2012 at 9:41 pm # Completely agreed! That is why I really think it should come down to consumer choice, and a system of laws and rules that discourages pollution and imposing costs on others. Unfortunately these debates often become too politicized. Reply youngandthrifty January 10, 2012 at 12:08 am # Ughh I feel sick- I have a broken CFL bulb sitting on my back porch.

Reply Roshawn @ Watson Inc January 10, 2012 at 8:39 am # You know, I am not necessarily for the ban either. I agree that if a product is superior (& is appropriately marketed), then why do they need to ban the other products to get consumers to switch. That’s a great point. I chuckled when you mentioned that in Germany, they are now marketed as “heat lamps.” I guess entrepreneurs are employing whatever will work.

Pursuing the ban has two directions: bankrupting the entrepreneurs and cleaning the environment. The choice is yours. Reply admin April 26, 2012 at 9:50 am # Not so much cleaning the environment with that mercury content.<query> when will incandescent bulbs be banned</query> It should be down to the consumers, I agree. Reply Canadian Doomer April 29, 2012 at 12:10 pm # I’m laughing at the idea of the heat from incandescent lights being welcome in icy cold Canada. I can’t remember the last time I thought “The room’s cold – quick, turn on a light.” Yes, I’m being silly and perhaps it’s because I just posted on energy-wise ways to keep *cool* this summer. We replaced all the lights in our apartment with CFLs a while ago and I certainly haven’t seen a problem. Dispose of them as you would a mercury thermometer. Many of us still have those in our homes and they contain far, far more mercury (1/2 gram) than a CFL bulb (1-5 mg). It’s not a matter of finding a hazmat suit – open a window for about 15 minutes, sweep the bulb into a secure container and take it to a proper disposal place, somewhere obscure and hard to find like … Home Depot, Ikea, Lowe’s … Personally, I see this as a good change.<query> how to keep cfl bulbs out of your house</query> When I see the Hummers pull into the gas station across the street, or look at the cigarette butts outside our apartment building, I question the wisdom of the consumer when it comes to choosing the better product. Reply admin May 2, 2012 at 8:28 am # I think your comment shows that it’s really a very subjective decision. I, too, replaced all the lights with CFLs, but I switched back as I couldn’t stand the lighting. I think they’re still fine for outdoor lights and other, similar areas. I didn’t even know about the differences in light spectrum and stuff like that, but I learned about that once I did my own research. It really comes down to personal preference. Different things make different people happy. Raw energy efficiency is a poor determinant of consumer utility, as different things use different amounts of energy.<query> can you use cfl lights outside</query> The most energy-efficient lifestyle might be to go life off the land and give up all modern conveniences, but I doubt many people would derive a lot of utility from that. The balancing fulcrum should be a person’s subjective desires, moderated by the avoidance of harming others via externalities. If you think incandescents use too much energy, then the proper, agnostic way is to moderate that based on power consumption and pollution at the utility source. A ban is the wrong way to go about it.

The way this was done was bydefunding the Department of Energy from the funds that it needs to actually enforce the ban. However, the law is still in effect and it is still illegal to manufacture these bulbs or import them into the United States, starting with the 100 watt bulbs. Around the world More information can be found on Wikipedia: Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs. Why is this ban harmful? Why do incandescent bulbs need to be banned? Are they really on the same level as CFCs and leaded gasoline? No. Unlike CFCs and leaded gasoline, incandescent lightbulbs do not directly nor indirectly harm others through their properties alone.<query> why are incandescent bulbs banned</query> Here is How You Can Work Around the Ban.

In addition, if a new product is technologically and subjectively superior, there would be absolutely no need for a ban in order for consumers to switch to the new product. They would switch themselves, by their own willingness to buy something that they judge is better. Everyone has their own personal reasons for preferring one form of lighting over others, but here are some qualitative reasons as to why the consumers need to be forced into buying alternatives, instead of doing it on their own free will: The light quality of CFLs is inferior to incandescent lighting. Incandescent lightbulbs emit a smooth spectrum of light that is very similar to the output of the sun. Both emit “blackbody” radiation, which is smooth across many different frequencies.<query> why do we need to ban lighting</query> This form of lighting is natural and is the type of lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Incandescent lights don’t burn as hot as the sun, and therefore they appear warmer and more yellowish as compared to sunlight. Incandescent lights may seem yellowish during the day, but these same properties also cause the light to be more pleasing to the eye at night, which is when the bulbs would actually be used. The light emitted by many CFLs, on the other hand, is far inferior. Fluorescent lights work by emitting ultraviolet radiation onto a phosphor coating; this coating is then excited and emits colors in the visible spectrum. This is similar to the ways that CRT TVs work. The problem is that this light is emitted in very narrow bands, which results in a rather unnatural form of light: Image via Wikipedia Such a spiky, unnatural spectrum can cause many symptoms, such as headaches, poorer sleep patterns, or a general malaise.<query> what is the difference between incandescent and fluorescent lights</query> This type of lighting is very artificial and not at all like the lighting that we have lived under for millions of years. Here is another example: Image via Wikipedia The easiest way to see this pattern is to take out a CD (a type of diffraction grating) and hold it under different types of lighting. You can easily see the jagged spectrum of a fluorescent light with this method. Here were some results obtained by using a diffraction grating: Spectra of different types of bulbs. Source: http://web.ncf.ca/jim/misc/cfl/ As you can see, only the LED comes close to a natural light spectrum, just like the incandescent. The spikes of additional blue and green light emitted by fluorescent lights may also cause problems with sleeping. Humans are sensitive to blue light in the evenings, and additional exposure can disrupt the natural sleep cycle.<query> what kind of light is fluorescent</query> (For those doing a lot of computer work at night: I recommendf.lux.) CFLs are hazardous to personal health and to the environment. Image by lundyd via Flickr Compact fluorescent lights contain mercury, an extremely toxic element that can cause significant neurological damage, especially to those at risk such as the pregnant, or young children. There is little mercury exposure so long as the bulbs are used and disposed of properly, but the problem is that a bulb can break, releasing mercury in the direct vicinity. Very few people actually dispose of these bulbs properly either because local programs don’t exist or it is too cumbersome to do so. That means that mercury can get into the local groundwater or air when disposed of in the trash and later dumped in the landfill or burned in the local incinerator. The mercury content can also be dangerous if a CFL bulb breaks and the dust is spread out over a wide area.<query> are cfls hazardous</query> When an incandescent bulb breaks, all you have to worry about is some sharp glass, but when a CFL bulb breaks, not only do you have to worry about cutting yourself on mercury-laced glass, but you also have to worry about breathing in the dust. Do you really think that people are going to be putting on gas masks and then separating the waste into a special container, which they will then bring to the local hazardous waste disposal center? No way. They will use a vacuum or a broom, spreading the mercury dust everywhere, and they will dump the broken remains of the bulb into the regular trash, where it will go on to potentially contaminate the groundwater. This has actually happened at a friend’s home. The CFL bulb did not have a screw-base, and it wasn’t properly installed.<query> what happens when a cfl bulb breaks</query> It fell out, crashing and spreading fine dust and glass bits everywhere. This friend used a broom and vacuum to sweep up the dust, probably inhaling a lot along the way, and then tossing everything in the regular trash. This is how most people are going to handle CFLs, and they will be exposing themselves and others to mercury along the way. Don’t incandescent lights actually emit more mercury? There is a disingenuous argument that incandescent lights emit more mercury than CFLs, but this is looking solely at the effect of coal power plants. This has absolutely nothing to do with the incandescent lightbulb itself and everything to do with the form of energy generation. In that sense, CFLs would also be contributing to additional mercury pollution beyond what they directly contribute. Even if you live in a jurisdiction where all of your power comes from dirty coal plants, you are probably living far away from the plant, and furthermore these plants have special scrubbers and environmental procedures in place in order to minimize the impact on humans and other wildlife.<query> do incandescent lights emit more mercury</query>"

After interviewing 250 dog owners and 250 cat owners nationwide, the survey also concluded nearly 50 per cent of female cat owners share their problems with their feline friend.<query> are dogs better listeners</query> More than 80 per cent of female and male dog or cat owners admit to “cherishing pets”, with more than 50 per cent considering themselves a mum or dad to their pets. Purina’s pet-care expert Shivaun Statham said the results mean that pets can become as endearing as a child or a close friend to many owners. “When people find strong companionship and affection in their pets, it is quite normal for them to begin treating their animals as important family members.” Does it apply to us Singaporeans too?

At 2048 x 1536 pixels, it has significantly more pixels than not just the old iPad, but also your 1080p HDTV and just about any other ""HD"" screen you've got lying around. Apple's again referring to it as a ""Retina Display,"" which means that you won't be able to see pixels with your bare, weakened, organic eyeballs, at least from the 15-inch distance Apple estimates most people have between their eyes and their iPads. (Note: Apple is clearly excluding cats, which have more sensitive eyes and sitcloser to the iPad anyway.<query> what is the resolution of the new ipad</query> This is offensive, probably.) That'll mean every publisher is going to have to re-do their apps for the new resolution, the same way they had to for the transition from the iPhone 3GS to the iPhone 4. Also included: a new processor, dubbed the A5X, that provides quad-core power. The Tegra 3, which powers a few Android tablets, is also quad-core, but Apple needs the power to burn through the kinds of apps that will take advantage of the new display. Plus there's a 4G LTE antenna, either for AT&T or Verizon, which is pretty great--we'retotally impressed by LTE, so it's great to see it here. And Apple has presumably worked some kind of gypsy magic to keep the battery life steady at 10 hours for Wi-Fi and nine hours for 4G--<query> what is the new apple ios</query> we've seen LTE absolutely slaughter battery life in phones, but hopefully Apple's worked that out. Oh, and the company also announced a new Apple TV! Seems like basically just a firmware upgrade, though it's not clear if older Apple TVs will get it. There's a new version of the software, some nice bonuses like being able to use iCloud for 1080p movie streaming, and shows available the next day for purchase. No Siri, though, which bums us out because wespent all morning dreaming about how sweet that'd be. The iPad and Apple TV both maintain pricing: iPad starts at $500, moving up from there due to storage and 4G inclusion, and the Apple TV costs $100.

Yet its quite the opposite. It still uses a A2 chip like the iPad 2. the graphics card is now a quad core but it also has to handle more pixels and therefore run at a higher GPU capacity to keep up with games. So it will still run the same speed as a iPad 2.<query> what is the processor on the new ipad</query> So i say no thanks. Link to this comment cptjames 03/07/12 at 3:37 pm A5 chip* typo sorry Link to this comment BSTUR1 03/07/12 at 4:17 pm @cpt Is that because the iPad2 runs so slowly? (which it doesn't - do you have any side by side comparisons to determine if any other tablet is faster?) @crapp You don't want to be viewing a gorgeous screen that performs better than any current tablet? The new iPad screams through graphics and looks beautiful doing it. You two are too funny. Neither of you would buy a tablet, let alone an iPad anyway so what's the deal? Just being trolls are you? Good luck with that.

Link to this comment somethingsnotright 03/07/12 at 6:15 pm LOL at people buying an Apple product ever 6 months a new one comes out. Don't really like tablets anyways. Sure they're cool and fun, but I'd much rather have a laptop and smartphone. Link to this comment marcoreid 03/07/12 at 7:04 pm Apple, like so many companies today, is a master of marketing. They manage to convince many millions of people around the world that they suddenly have a product that their device will solve for them. Oddly enough, 99% of the problems that their device solves were never seen as problems before. It's common for me to hear people who are hooked on such products describe them to me as, ""It's not more than you need, it's just more than you're used to."" I have many friends, coworkers, and neighbors who find themselves spending $1000-$2000 a year now on iPads, iPhones, apps (most of which are just entertainment), e-books, etc.<query> how much does apple charge for a tablet</query> Many of them tell me they are tight on their finances, due to the economy, and that they never have time to do many of the things they used to do. Only upon asking them some rather pointed questions do they admit (or even realize) that what they've done is spent a lot of money just to mostly waste their time. I had one friend who, after such a discussion, actually felt physically ill afterwards, realizing how he's changed. He said something to the effect of, ""I can't believe I've actually spent a thousand bucks on a glorified toy that eats my time, makes me anti-social, and has made me fat and lazy. I feel like such a sheep."" I'm a big fan of technology, and am often an early adopter of technologies that I feel actually meet a real need I actually have.<query> why do people feel ill after spending money</query> I've got backgrounds in programming and computer support, degrees in marketing and engineering, have managed the IT operations of small investment firms, and currently own a tech firm that provides web tools to wireless dealers, so I have a great deal of tech experience. So much so that anybody who knows me and has any kind of tech question comes to me first. And yet... I don't find the need to own many of the gadgets that everyone froths for these days. Maybe it's my marketing degree, but I guess I just understand the difference in my life between an actual need and a want that has been portrayed by some company's marketing department as a need. It's part of what has made me successful and happy and secure. As for the iPad... I do not need one. It doesn't offer me the capabilities of a laptop, so I can't justify it to work.<query> do i need an ipad</query>"

Employees: 20,621 2009 Revenue: $23.6 billion CEO: Eric Schmidt What They Do: Google gets most of its revenue from search advertising, but it has high aspirations for its Enterprise division and its flagship product, Apps Premier. The hosted collaboration and communication suite includes applications for e-mail, calendar, office productivity, intranet, video sharing and discussion forums. The Pitch Google Apps Premier offers enterprises cloud-based messaging and collaboration software intended to cost less and to be simpler to deploy and manage than on-premise systems. Unlike the free Standard edition, Premier offers IT management tools to support enterprise software integration, user provisioning and migration among its capabilities.<query> where is google headquarters</query> At first, CIOs didn’t bite, but during the past three years, Google has steadily strengthened Premier’s features and security. Today, customers include companies as diverse as Genentech and Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), with thousands of users. Rajen Sheth, a Google Apps senior product manager, says Gmail has been Premier’s main attraction, but now Google is beefing up its Docs office productivity suite to better compete with Microsoft (MSFT) Office. “It’s an area we’re ready to delve into a lot more deeply now,” Sheth says. “Going forward, we’ll be able to offer them a choice for office productivity.” The catchIBM ( IBM) and Microsoft are moving fast to tweak their Lotus Notes and Exchange products—as well as release new ones—to provide the cost savings and management benefits of hosted suites like Google Apps.<query> who is google premier</query> Meanwhile, end users may resist the switch from familiar applications. The Schumacher Group, a healthcare company, bought 2,000 Premier seats to provide e-mail for doctors who are independent contractors. But full-time employees are sticking with Exchange, in part to avoid the change-management process, says CIO Douglas Menefee. The city of Orlando, Fla., trained 3,000 users on Premier Gmail, calendar and contacts. But Google Docs will wait until PCs deployed two years ago with Microsoft Office 2007 are no longer usable, CIO Conrad Cross says. The usual concerns about cloud computing—whether storing data off-premise is secure, and worries about bugs, outages and performance issues over which IT departments have no control—also apply. What’s more, say CIOs, Google has much to learn about cultivating relationships with enterprise customers.<query> who is the cio of google docs</query> Omnetic, the Schumacher Group’s Premier reseller and integrator, enjoys good communication with enterprise engineers at Google, and Menefee has sales contacts there. “But I don’t feel I have solid communications with Google from the support and engineering perspectives,” he says. The scoreNucleus Research analyst Rebecca Wettemann says Google has moved quickly in the past year to make Apps Premier a viable choice for CIOs. “Google has taken important steps in terms of usability, performance, reliability and, most important, providing guidance to enterprises on how to deploy these tools effectively,” she says. However, there’s no simple answer for CIOswho wonder if the suite is a good fit for their companies. “You have to know what the cost of providing the service internally is,” Cross says. “Otherwise, you won’t know what your savings will be and why it would be to your advantage to adopt Apps.” Cross also warns that while ditching an on-premise system for Apps reduces the IT staff’s internal server-maintenance work, it doesn’t mean IT executives can abdicate their management roles.<query> is google apps premier a good fit for a cio</query> You still have to make sure Google meets its obligations, he says.

Hear what Research Scientist T.V. Raman has to say about working at Google Google’s mission: Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Google is an engineering company. The Google web site is powered by some amazing technology, most of it developed in-house. Yet people often ask us what we do here at Google Engineering. “What are you working on? Isn’t search a solved problem?” Glad you asked. We’re working on lots of interesting stuff and one of the main reasons is that search is far from a solved problem.<query> why do you work at google</query> It's got lots of really smart people, amazing technology, fun problems, and a chance to make a real difference in the world. Does this sound like an environment in which you would thrive? See all of our current Software Engineering openings! ©2012 Google<query> what is software engineering</query> Perhaps you’re interested in Norse mythology and search for information about “Thor”. The results page shows “Results 1-10” out of millions of links. That seems like a lot of information, but look at the results. Mixed in with information about the god of thunder there may be links to sites about medical equipment companies, bus builders, comic superheroes, even a movie. To someone looking for those other Thors, the Norse god is less interesting; to you, though, it's the other way around. Google prides itself on its algorithm for choosing the most relevant pages, but search hascontext, which is just one of the considerations in choosing the right results. Plus, the top pages listed are all in English; surely there are some interesting web pages in Norwegian (or even Old Norse) that we could translate for you, and chances are at least some of them deserve high ranking.<query> what is the norse god of thunder</query> And whether we’re asking about the god, the superhero, the equipment, or the movie, there should be images, maybe movies or animations, and other rich content available; how do we find that? Plus there are many other sources of information about Thor (the god) that the web doesn’t reach: ancient sagas, oral histories; who knows? So yes, Google is very good at searching the web for relevant pages for the query you type, but the web isn’t enough and `relevant' is a relative term. The search problem remains far from solved. The web really is only part of the story. There's the information the web doesn’t reach and then there's personal information like mail and photos. How about the schedule of the bus you take every morning? The schedule of the busthis morning?<query> what is the web?</query> The view from the beachfront timeshare you’re thinking of renting next summer? The best route to the concert? Whether that cough is worth seeing a doctor about? Information defines the modern world; making it available and helpful is our mission. Google is much more than search, and our mission has much greater scope. We have our work cut out for us. Feel like helping? You don’t need to be an expert on searching. To handle information at the scale of the web requires ideas from just about every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, user interface design; the list goes on. Or look at it this way: a typical query to Google can touch thousands of machines before returning the answer.<query> what is google's mission</query> With all those machines and all that communication, the problems can be daunting and new ideas and new technologies can always be brought to bear. And then there are all the specialist domains: geospatial information (mapping), bioinformatics (health and genetics), image processing (photos, video), and on and on. Wherever you live, there's likely to be a Google engineering office nearby. Google has engineering centers in cities throughout the US and all around the world. Each office works on problems big and small, global and local, according on the particular strengths of the engineers in the area. We want to hire the best people we can, regardless of where they live. The Story So Far The problems are tough, but we've made significant progress. Besides constructing the world's most heavily used web search engine and a lot of other public web services (www.google.com, news.google.com, images.google.com, groups.google.com, catalogs.google.com, labs.google.com,<query> where is google engineering located</query> maps.google.com, gmail.google.com, scholar.google.com, adwords.google.com), not to mention the Google Appliance and the Google Toolbar, Google Engineering has achieved a number of other milestones you may not be as familiar with: We designed and built an advertising system that automatically performs hundreds of millions of automated auctions per day to determine the placement and prices ofadvertisements appearing on Google search result pages and non-search pages on dozens of other sites. We built a very large scale, distributed, fault-tolerant file system, called GFS, to help manage and process huge data sets. Apaper in SOSP 2003 describes the file system. We designed and developed a fully automatic news system (news.google.com), which has rapidly become a standard tool for human journalists. Custom algorithms group together articles about the same story from different news organizations from around the world, providing diverse viewpoints about the day's events.<query> what is google engineering</query> Heuristics judge the importance of each story relative to other stories in the news around the world to generate our headline summary pages automatically. We built a searchable archive of millions of catalog pages by scanning and OCR'ing printed catalogs. This experimental service demonstrates the benefits of a searchable interface for information not previously easy to search or browse. We’re exploring large-scale machine learning as a means of improving search quality. Our spelling correction system is one excellent example (spehl korector? phonitick spewling? who needs a dictniary?). People searching for Britney Spears have clearly found it useful on many occasions. In more recent work, we have been working on algorithms and techniques to construct very large scale Bayesian network models to help understand the relationships between words. We are building a large-scale public e-mail system capable of storing 2 GB of data per user, with a unique user interface that centers around search, scaling to many millions of users.<query> what is the purpose of large scale machine learning</query> All this is achieved by connecting together tens of thousands of servers behindgoogle.com and providing them with a lot of custom-built, cutting-edge, innovative software. It should be clear by now that the search problem involves much more than just searching, and that some of the most exciting work at Google happens behind the scenes. We’re also working on a number of interesting projects at the moment that are too preliminary to discuss here, and we’re always looking for new and interesting ideas. Who we are Who did all this? A dedicated and growing team of smart, creative programmers and computer scientists – but we just call them engineers. They come to Google with expertise in a large range of topics. And before they joined Google, some of them also built software, hardware, tools and other technology you might have used: A Bug's Life The Apache Software Foundation Alpha CPUs and Alpha-based Multiprocessor Systems Apple Lisa Aspect-oriented Programming ATOM (A Tool for Object-file Modification) Cilk CiteSeer Cyrus IMAP DCPI Deep Space 1 The Digital Michelangelo Project Epi Info FLASH Project FreeBSD GIGAswitch/ATM (Autonet 2) Gimp Gnome Gnumeric GNU findutils gtk The Human Genome Project Hyperbolic Browsing ical IEEE Std 1003.1, POSIX Interlisp Itsy Pocket Computer Java HotSpot The Java Virtual Machine Specification JScheme lex (by our CEO!)

Some love thinking long and hard about difficult problems; others just enjoy getting their hands dirty building and deploying massive, real-world systems. What they all share, though, is an enthusiasm for the challenge of making the world a better place through the intelligent application of information technology. It's a blast. Interested? There is so much still to be done, so many hard (but fun!) problems to solve, so much information in the world, we'd like some of you to join us to help us in our task of making Google even better. The engineering challenges we face at Google are exciting and the perks of working here are wonderful, but the real reason most of our engineers came here is that Google Engineering is a great place to work.<query> why do engineers work at google</query>"

Google Desktop Search, which for now works with Windows XP, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 and above, represents a new front in Microsoft's war for the Web; it was never really about the browser, according to Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. While Microsoft came to dominate the desktop OS market, the rise of the Web threatened it, because people didn't need a specific operating system to access Web content. ""Netscape was not really the competitive threat Microsoft was trying to address [with Internet Explorer],"" Wilcox said. ""By making the browser part of the operating system, if you have the dominant platform, you can extend it to the Web. You're also extending the utility of the operating system and the way it takes in information."" Google's move has again raised the question of whether Windows is required to access the Web.<query> what is google desktop search</query> ""By extending its search platform, Google creates a presence in other browsers and other operating systems, and potentially in new devices that will be increasingly be used to access the Web, such as Wi-Fi-enabled PDAs, cell phones and smart phones,"" Wilcox said. At the same time, Google has invaded Microsoft's prime turf: the desktop. Said John Battelle, author of an upcoming book on search, ""Search has become a de facto interface for the Internet, and I think Google has quite elegantly leveraged that presumption back onto the desktop."" He said Google's clean and simple interface is a better solution to finding all the various files that Microsoft creates. While it's neither an alternative to Windows nor an interface on top of it, he added, ""there's no question that this approach will eat into the amount of quality time a consumer spends with Windows."" But desktop search itself is not such a threat to Redmond, said Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff.<query> why is google desktop search better than windows</query> Microsoft certainly knew Google was working on this, and MSN is working on a similar tool, with Lookout as the basis. In July, Microsoft bought Lookout, a third-party developer's ""personal search tool"" that lets users search their desktops from within their Outlook e-mail client. The software was placed under the purview of the MSN Search team, which is working onnew Web search technology. At the same time, another team at Microsoft is building WinFS, a new file system that supposedly will let users search through multiple file types stored on a desktop computer. But Lookout -- and Google Desktop Search -- are very different from WinFS. ""WinFS is a whole different search beast,"" said Jupiter Research analyst Joe Wilcox. ""You're talking about more than just searching for documents, you're also searching for complex information.<query> what is lookout</query> One of its fundamental aspects is being able to use metadata as a means of not just finding information but also making it more meaningful."" ""MSN is making significant investments in search, and we will ship the product when we are confident it will meet the needs of our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said. The company plans to release betas of the new algorithmic search engine and desktop search in the U.S. by the end of 2004. Rosoff said that WinFS is a non-starter in this battle. Microsoft admitted in August that WinFS would not ship as part of Longhorn, the next Windows version expected in 2006. ""It's not going to be in Longhorn, and I'm not sure when we'll see it,"" he said. ""MSN search will be their answer to Google for the time being."" In fact, he said, Microsoft has always used MSN as a blocking tool, first against AOL and most recently, with thelaunch of MSN Music, against Apple's iTunes music download service.<query> when will msn be available</query> ""MSN has the time and resources, and they will hammer at this idea until they perceive the threat is gone,"" he said. ""The bigger threat from Google is that end users will turn more and more to hosted online services to perform regular functions, rather than using the Windows shell or Microsoft desktop applications,"" Rosoff said. ""The threat [is] from hosted applications versus Microsoft's thick client and desktop operating system. When Google is looking more and more like a thin-client company, that poses threat to Microsoft's core business model."" And it's not like there aren't other alternatives for desktop search, according to Gary Price, author of ""The Invisible Web."" He pointed out that companies like Copernic haveoffered desktop search for years. ""Alta Vista in its raw form is still more powerful than Google,"" he said, adding that Google doesn't index a lot of file formats.<query> what is the threat of google</query> Josh Jacobs, president of search technology provider X1, which powers part of the new Snap personal search tool, said his company's desktop search technology indexes 255 different file types, including MP3 and PDF. X1, which retails for $79.95, is aimed at professionals who understand file types and how to refine searches, while Google Desktop Search, according to Marissa Mayer, Google director of consumer Web products, is aimed at people who aren't sure of where the information they're looking for is located. ""A lot of time users don't even remember where things are,"" she said. ""All they remember is that they saw it."" X1 users, on the other hand, ""focuses on people who use desktop search as a part of the way they do their jobs,"" Jacobs said. ""They're people for whom the information on their computer is the key to business success."" Jacobs said he welcomed the arrival of Google's product, because it would raise awareness of the desktop search category.<query> what is the difference between google desktop search and x1</query> After all, awareness is one of Google's key strengths. Said Price, news editor ofSearch Engine Watch, which, like Jupiter Research, has the same corporate owner asinternetnews.com. ""What's equally impressive about Google is how they've turned something you can't hold in your hands into a verb -- without doing any consumer-facing marketing."" ""A lot of companies besides Google do desktop search,"" Battelle said. ""But none of them are Google. Integrating it into Google's strength, the Web interface, that's what makes it special."" But if the desktop is the new front in the war for the domination of search, the battle has just begun. As Microsoft homes in on the problem via the OS and MSN, rivals Yahoo , AOL , Ask Jeeves and even e-commerce-oriented Amazon are offering their own versions.<query> what is google's strength</query>"

Posted in Uncategorized | 2 Comments » MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM December 22nd, 2011 by Robert Bismuth MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM Android 4.0.3 came out from Google on Friday December 16th and who could resist the challenge? So, MIPS engineers picked up the release from the Google source tree and ported it to MIPS within 24 hours.<query> what is mips</query> In fact, they decided to push through the weekend and bring 4.0.3 up on the Ingenic/Ainol tablet. Thus we were able to give Ainol a head start towards an over the air (OTA) upgrade for tablets sold to-date plus schedule a switch over to 4.0.3 for new tablets. But there is more here than just our dedication to supporting MIPS’ licensees and the Android community … Android 4.0 expands on Google’s use of LLVM, and MIPS completely supports this initiative – in fact, when Google adopted LLVM 3.0 as the basis of Renderscript in Android 4.0.3, MIPS support was already available. So, what is LLVM, and why is it important for the Android community? LLVM – Low Level Virtual Machine – is an umbrella for modular compiler technologies. It includes a C/C++ compiler front-end, a portable code generator supporting a wide variety of architectures, an aggressive optimizer, and an efficient just-in-time (JIT) compiler on the back-end.<query> what is llvm</query> Renderscript, the first technology in Android to use LLVM, first became popular in HoneyComb (Android 3.0)–as a set of low-level APIs targeting 3D rendering and compute operations. In fact Renderscript is an example of using the high-performance APIs provided by LLVM to achieve the same level of system performance that developers could expect were they instead to use native code on the underlying device. But unlike the existing Android native development kit (NDK), this solution is cross-platform – meaning that applications built using this technology can run on several architectures supported by LLVM. The inclusion of MIPS optimizations for LLVM in Google’s Android 4.0.3 release takes a great step in making LLVM available for more general use by app developers seeking to exploit native processor performance and capabilities while retaining complete portability in the Android universe.<query> what is renderscript</query> So what’s behind this LLVM push for Android? MIPS actually became involved in the industry’s LLVM initiative over a year ago – before it became generally available in Android. This was when MIPS’ compiler group realized that LLVM was going to be a major basis for applications in the future. LLVM had already been the basis of Apple’s application environment for the iPhone and iPad. Our engineers felt that it was only a matter of time before it became the basis of application development environments in the wider market. We were clearly not alone in our thinking, and so LLVM first appeared in Android. By supplying our LLVM technology for the MIPS architecture to Google, we have enabled all MIPS licensees, their OEMs and application developers targeting their platforms to have access to the best possible execution environment on MIPS-based platforms, starting with Android 4.0.3.<query> when did llvm come out</query> Of course, as Android moves forward, MIPS will make further refinements to LLVM on the MIPS architecture available to Google. We will also make available other optimizations and software related to improving Android’s “out of the box” support for the MIPS architecture. Android has become an enormous force in the consumer electronics market – a market in which MIPS’ legendary performance, power efficiency and cost effectiveness have been well recognized. The MIPS architecture has already been adopted widely on just about every type of consumer device … cell phones, tablets, set-top boxes, and digital TVs to name a few. The inclusion of support for the MIPS architecture directly in this latest key facility of Android provides an even more attractive future for all of our licensees and their customers – and ultimately for the end users who continually seek out the best price/performance products available in the market and rely on those products in their day to day lives.<query> what is mips architecture</query> MIPS is moving forward with Android – as always, we are focused on going beyond simply what the market is demanding. We know that providing an enriched apps development environment benefits all end users. More apps, anywhere and any time, running on Android, running on MIPS! Posted in Uncategorized | 3 Comments » Convergence with a Caveat: Will the TV, tablet, smartphone and computer converge into one master device? December 14th, 2011 by Kevin Kitagawa The evolution of the iPhone and Android smartphones have allowed consumers to be entertained, to easily access information on-the-go and to communicate with anyone from anywhere. Need directions to the nearest gas station? Look it up on Google Maps. Need restaurant recommendations? Launch your Yelp app. Need to waste 10 minutes while waiting for someone?<query> what is mips</query> How about a few levels of Angry Birds? Want to listen to music or watch a movie away from home? You can do that. Talk, text or facetime your friends? No problem. As we all enjoy the features and functions enabled by today’s “smarter” mobile and portable devices, TVs have become smarter too. Today’s TVs are adding internet connectivity, streaming video and TV programming such as Netflix and Hulu, voice/video conferencing capabilities such as Skype, and much more. In addition, Smart TVs can access movies, pictures, and music on any DLNA capable device such as a Windows 7 machine or tablets. As these devices become more powerful and feature-rich, some people think that we will ultimately see all of the capabilities of TV, mobile phone, tablet and PC converge into one master device.<query> what is the smart tv</query> But is that really a possibility? The short answer is, I don’t think so. Battery Life Consider first the matter of battery life. Gone are the days of going a week without needing to charge our phones. Most of us constantly charge our phones at home, work and even in the car just to power a single day. Even with this constant battery charging, many of us swap in other devices to further conserve power. For example, I will use my iPod Touch to watch a movie during an hour at the gym, to be sure I have enough smartphone power for a conference call later in the day. Just imagine the incredible amount of battery life a device would need to provide in order to meet our daily usage appetite for all online/media consumption/phone activities. Today’s devices just can’t supply that.<query> why do we need to charge our phones</query> Size Matters Secondly, what size would a master device be? Watching video content on my smartphone/tablet is a bit of a compromise. While this is something I would do on a plane or while stuck waiting for hours on end somewhere, while I am at home, I much prefer to watch movies/TV shows in front of my TV. Some people have proposed that the smartphone can become a set-top box by “docking” it with the TV. This capability will definitely be possible in the near future, but I don’t see this ever replacing a dedicated set-top box that stays in the living room. There are too many questions to sort out: Whose smartphone should be used as the main set-top box? What happens if that person receives a private phone call in the middle of a live football game?<query> can a smartphone be used as a set top box</query> Programming A MIPS Core MIPS32® 74K® Class MIPS32® 34K® Class MIPS32® 24K® Class MIPS32® 24KE™ Class MIPS32® 4K® Class MIPS32® 4KE™ Class MIP32® 4KS™ Class MIPS32® M4K™ Class Certified Training Centers Private Training Programming Extension for a MIPS32® 34K™ CORE Documentation Open a Software Support Case File a License Request Ecosystem MIPS Ecosystem MIPS Alliance Members MIPS Design Centers Android on MIPS Customers Licensees News & Events Newsroom Image Library Media Contacts Release Archive 2010 Release Archive 2009 Release Archive 2008 Release Archive 2007 Release Archive 2006 Release Archive 2005 Release Archive 2004 Release Archive 2003 Industry Highlights 2009 Industry Highlights 2008 Industry Highlights 2007 Industry Highlights 2006 Industry Highlights In the News 2010 In the News 2009 In the News 2008 In the News 2007 In the News 2006 In the News Events Archive Newsletter<query> what is mips32 core</query> What happens if that person is not at home — how would the family watch a program that was recorded on that person’s phone? At least in my family, this simply wouldn’t work. Even in the future when all data will be stored remotely in the “cloud space,” and each device becomes more or less a screen with all content available on-demand, there will be a need for each device to retain its primary purpose. Primary Functions While a smartphone could operate as a master device, it’s very clear that smartphones, tablets, personal computers, set-top boxes, and TVs each have primary functions at which they excel. The smartphone is primarily a phone and mobile internet device. A tablet brings casual email and a better mobile internet experience with its larger screen. The TV is still a one-to-many entertainment device.<query> what is the primary function of a smartphone</query> And the PC is still the best machine for writing reports, developing Powerpoint presentations, and other work-related tasks. In the case of set-top boxes, that primary purpose is delivering premium content in a way that is secure, acceptable to content owners (e.g. HBO and Showtime) and seamless to viewers. The idea of any one of these devices becoming a “master device” spells compromise for the primary functions of those other devices. Smart devices will complement each other What these devices WILL do is complement each other by allowing intelligent interaction between devices. Today, we already see smartphones and tablets being used as remote controls for TVs. Very soon, we will be able to engage in even more advanced integrated tasks. For example, there have been many times while watching a TV show or movie that I wanted to find out more information about something in real time – perhaps the name of an actor/actress or the location of the scene I’m watching.<query> what is the purpose of smart devices</query> With a tablet next to me on the couch, I can instantly research the relevant information. Even so, I need to type in my search terms on the tablet to get my information. And while today’s smart TVs allow us to access the internet in order to search directly from the TV, this interaction disrupts the show for everyone else. In the future, smart TVs and set-top boxes will have the ability to deliver relevant keywords to a connected tablet / smartphone by hitting a button on the TV remote allowing a user to search. In addition, game shows could allow multiple users at home to play along with contestants, vote for participants, or comment in real time. Using a tablet together with a TV during live sports events could enable a user to control different camera views, have user controlled instant replay, or bring up live individual or team statistics, all without disrupting what is being displayed on the TV.<query> what is the future of smart tv</query> Convergence with a caveat I believe that convergence will indeed occur among devices, but it will be a kind offunctional, not device convergence. We will continue to have separate devices, but they will speak and interact with each other much more seamlessly. Each device will have a lot of similar functionality, but will retain the primary functions at which they excel. Until we have the technology to deliver weeks of battery life on a device that will fit in my pocket and deliver a 60” HDTV experience when I’m home, I see each of these devices being part of our lives. It’s a convergence of functionality, but with a caveat. Tags: Android, convergence, Digital Home, mobile, Smart TV Posted in Uncategorized | 2 Comments » It’s an Android Ice Cream Sandwich Tablet, and it’s MIPS!<query> what is convergence</query> December 9th, 2011 by Robert Bismuth Something has changed in the Android world. The first example of a platform/form factor available with the latest release of Android is not an ARM-based platform. It’s MIPS-Based, and it really is the world’s first available Android 4.0 tablet, with full Ice Cream Sandwich functionality and great performance/features –all for less than $100. If you haven’t seen it yet,check out the video on YouTube. How did this happen? Of course, it really didn’t happen overnight. It is also only the first of a series of upcoming advantages that MIPS-Based solutions will give Android users. Legendary performance, great power management and affordable licensing terms combine to yield an extremely desirable, affordable solution for end users. This of course fits perfectly with Google’s intentions for Android.<query> what is the first tablet to have mips</query> From the very first, Google created Android for portability across hardware architectures. Initially some people began to think that Android was a single architecture platform simply because of application processor choices made by mobile handset OEMs that were based on their existing designs. Andy Rubin reminded the world of Android’s neutrality when he blogged about hisGene Amdahl moment back in April 2011. MIPS Technologies has worked with the Android sources since the operating systems’ early days, and has made reference ports available of all the major, applicable Android releases. We recognized early on the potential for Android to move beyond mobile phones and into all corners of consumer electronics – including DTVs and set-top boxes, areas where MIPS is already the leading architecture. Across these areas and others, many MIPS licensees have adopted Android to provide a definitive advantage for their customers.<query> why was android created</query> And now comes Android 4.0 – Ice Cream Sandwich – available on the MIPS architecture. Android 4.0 is significant for both users and new adopters of Android. With this release, Google has improved the user interface based on feedback from Android users. New features have been added to the platform and existing features have become more polished and efficient. However, the single biggest step forward for MIPS’ licensees comes in terms of the basic requirements for Google’s definition of an Android Compatible Device. No longer do devices need to have all the attributes of a mobile device, phone or tablet. In other words, you don’t need a touch screen to be Android Compatible. All you need are a display and an input device that provides the relevant service inside the Android system. This is very important for Google as it expands the Android universe of device types.<query> what is the android 4.0</query> Many of MIPS licensees are well positioned to take advantage of this step forward since they already build SoCs for DTVs, set-top boxes and other digital home products. Now their OEMs will be able to more quickly achieve Android Compatible Device status by starting with Android 4.0 running on MIPS. What could be better than that? We chose to launch Android 4.0 on MIPS in the mobile space not just because we could, but because it illustrates the flexible nature of the MIPS architecture. The MIPS architecture powers not only a wide variety of low power products such as mobile handsets, tablets, portable media devices and ebooks, but it also scales to extremely high performance, powering some of the fastest network infrastructure processors – the devices that in aggregate compose the very backbone of the world’s network infrastructure. We have cores in our current offering and future roadmap that address a broad range of application spaces.<query> what is mips</query> And we have the ecosystem and technologies to support those applications, including support for symmetric multiprocessing, multithreading and 64 bit capabilities. Android on MIPS is a natural fit. It leverages our substantial legacy as a leading RISC architecture – the architecture that is taught around the world as the fundamental RISC architecture. It provides our licensees’ OEMs with a competitive software environment that end users are choosing as their preferred system environment. On top of that, like Android, MIPS is the economical choice with it comes to price/performance. We broke new ground this month by enabling Ingenic and its OEM Ainol to become the first to market with an Android 4.0 tablet. We will continue to break new ground. We always have. That’s what we do. Bottom line: it’s MIPS. Andy Rubin of Google said it best in our press release: “I’m thrilled to see the entrance of MIPS-Based Android 4.0 tablets into the market.<query> what is mips</query> Low cost, high performance tablets are a big win for mobile consumers and a strong illustration of how Android’s openness drives innovation and competition for the benefit of consumers around the world.” Tags: Android, Ice Cream Sandwich Posted in Uncategorized | 5 Comments » Ice Cream Sandwich – Google’s Next Android Delicacy – Coming Soon to MIPS! November 9th, 2011 by Robert Bismuth Android has really fired up everyone’s appetite in the consumer electronics market: Cupcake, Donut, Éclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, and now, Ice Cream Sandwich – the latest delight from the Patisserie Chez Google. Starting with the earliest Android releases on up through the Honeycomb release this past spring, all versions of Android have shipped on MIPS-based consumer electronics platforms. The latest version about to be released by Google is Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).<query> when is google ice cream sandwich coming to mips</query> Community Blog Blog RSS Facebook LinkedIn Newsroom RSS Twitter YouTube Developer Android Web Browsing Performance Greatly Enhanced by Multi-Core and Multi-Threading Technologies February 8th, 2012 by Eyal Barzilay MIPS’ MT technology boosts performance 43 percent; combined MT & MC boosts performance 150 percent By Eyal Barzilay, Applications and Benchmarking Manager The use of multi-core technology to deliver more CPU horsepower is one of the increasingly common methods to providing higher system performance in hardware. This is true even for high volume consumer applications where cost and power can be very important. However, upgrading to a multi-core system doesn’t automatically guarantee performance improvements or an enhanced user experience. It’s not just a hardware problem – software must be written in a way that can make use of parallel hardware resources.<query> what is multicore technology</query> Once Google releases the sources, MIPS and our licensees will quickly have ports ready for OEM platforms. The whole industry is anxiously awaiting the open source release of Ice Cream Sandwich. When Google announced the ICS lead device back in October, some people mistakenly thought that ICS had been released. It had not been released at that time, and still has not been released by Google. This situation is no different than the announcement/release process for all prior Android releases. Google has always followed the same process when releasing Android: Each major version of Android is developed in the context of a lead platform for that version. The lead platform device is announced and demonstrated at some date in advance of the official release of the new version of Android. At some point following the announcement of the lead platform, the new version of Android is released and sources become available for porting.<query> when was ics released</query> For ICS, steps 1 and 2 have now been completed. Step 3 has not yet been completed and until it happens, no OEM, silicon vendor or processor architecture company has access to the ICS sources. Even when step 3 occurs, only the lead platform device is ready to be shipped at that moment in time, since a port of Android for that specific device alone was done by Google during its development process. MIPS and the rest of the market will only get access to ICS when step 3 happens – whenever Google sets the date. When it does happen, MIPS’ software engineers will immediately dig into the ICS sources and quickly produce a MIPS reference port and tool chain for use by our licensees, their OEM customers and app developers. Given our extensive experience porting previous versions of Android, we do not anticipate this will take our engineers very long.<query> when does microsoft ics port start</query> Of course, we will post updates here and on our developer website,http://developer.mips.com. ICS is an evolutionary development of Android and clearly builds on the strengths of Honeycomb. We ported Honeycomb to the MIPS architecture early on and have continually refined that port over the course of this year. That experience will clearly accelerate the port of ICS to the MIPS architecture. MIPS is ready and waiting to bring Ice Cream Sandwich onto our architecture and into the hands of our licensees, their OEM customers and application developers!

So with Intel out of the smart TV picture, what does this mean for the industry?<query> what is ics</query> Who is the processor winner? According toa recent article on VentureBeat, “A potential winner here is Mips, which has been designing chips for Android-based smart TVs.” Thanks for the nod, Dean Takahashi! We agree. I read in a news article that Intel claims it “…led the creation and launch of the smart TV category and its first products.” This is quite a stretch! With its Atom-based CE4100 and CE4200 SoCs targeted at the digital home, Intel’s few major design wins, including the unsuccessful first generation of Google TV, were not for DTV per se. They were in reality over-the-top (OTT) IP set-top boxes—not connected DTV platforms. Even the Sony TV that was at the heart of the Google TV effort used a MIPS-Based SoC for the DTV functionality, with an Intel-based Google TV board connected to it.<query> who is the processor winner</query> Why? Ultimately, Intel is limited by the size and power consumption of its architecture. Across the DTV category, MIPS Technologies provides the number one processor architecture. This includes DTVs, set-top boxes, Blu-ray players and more. If we look at DTV in particular, MIPS licensees are shipping more units than any of our competitors into this market, with MIPS processors shipping inside of DTVs from LG, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, Toshiba, Vizio and other major brands. Shipments of DTVs in the overall market are experiencing a relatively weak period right now, but the potential for the future is huge as home entertainment technologies proliferate into geographies where they were never before possible, and as smart TVs begin to gain a toehold. According to a recent report from IHS iSuppli, “During the next four years, DTV broadcast switchovers will occur in emerging regions such as Latin America, China and Asia-Paciﬁc.” IHS iSuppli forecasts that the worldwide DTV market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent from 2010 to 2015, with annual shipments expected to reach 245.9 million units in 2015.<query> what is the dtv processor</query> The firm goes on to point out that “In the wake of the TV market transition to digital comes the age of the ‘smart’ TV, with all major TV original equipment manufacturers offering new features and functionality via Internet connectivity to TV sets. IHS expects a transition to occur from digital to smart in order to offer similar opportunities to the TV semiconductor supply chain, just as digital has in the recent past.” And while ‘smart’ DTV today represents only the ultra high-end of the DTV market, as the digital home processor leader, MIPS has been laying the groundwork for MIPS-Based smart connected entertainment for several years. Through our ‘Android on MIPS’ initiative, MIPS and our licensees announced the world’s first Android set-top boxes, and there are MIPS-Based Android TVs already shipping in the market.<query> what is mips</query> MIPS is also positioned very well to support Google TV if future generations of this platform experience success. According to Google, Google TV will be based on Android 3.1 (also known as “Honeycomb”). MIPS already has Android Honeycomb running on several SoC devices and we will soon announce the shipment of end products. With that in mind, our licensees can easily support Google TV if they feel that the demand is there. So clearly MIPS is in a strong position regardless of Intel’s decision to remain in this market or leave it. But as most of you know, MIPS and Intel are not the only processor games in town. How will MIPS win against other processor vendors targeting the digital home market, and DTV in particular? As the incumbent in the digital home, we are starting from a position of strength.<query> what processor is intel</query> And as we have pointed out before, the MIPS architecture is more performance-efficient than the competition. This is particularly important in the DTV market where shrinking margins demand the highest possible performance at the lowest possible cost. With MIPS, our licensees get the best combination of performance, price and power. In addition, with the growing applications ecosystem around MIPS for mobile and smart digital home, we are well positioned to provide the solutions our customers need when smart TV moves from the ultra high-end into the mainstream.

August 1st, 2011 by Rao Gattupalli Important factors to consider when choosing an embedded processor for a new project or for a follow-on/upgrade to an existing project include: The highest performing processor for a given die size and power profile Robust roadmap from the vendor and the choice of architectures in the processor family that facilitate optimal programming paradigms for a given application Software tools, applications and SoC partner ecosystem for the processor family Scalability of application performance for software investment protection Ease of adoption on a new project or ease of migration for an upgrade to an existing project Software investment is the biggest ticket item in any project.<query> what is mips</query> Hence it is important to choose an instruction set architecture (ISA) that offers a truly scalable solution for future development. To address various embedded market segments, our distinct, binary-compatible families of processor cores span applications from 32-bit microcontrollers all the way to 64-bit multi-threaded, superscalar many-core processors for networking infrastructure, and numerous digital consumer markets in between. Since one can seamlessly scale the performance range between a wide array of processors, the MIPS architecture offers an ideal path for protecting software investment on a new design or a follow-on/upgrade to an existing project. MIPS Technologies provides the most performance efficient cores for embedded designs, with the highest performance for a given die size and power profile. MIPS’ superscalar cores are ideal for a single-threaded programming model and our multi-threaded cores facilitate both coarse grain parallelism, with virtual processing elements (VPEs) and multiple cores, to fine grain parallelism with thread contexts (TCs).<query> what is mips</query> A multi-threaded architecture is the most efficient way to implement applications or functions that are highly parallelizable. The MIPS64 architecture enables applications to take advantage of larger virtual address space that is greater than 4GB. An important factor to note is that MIPS32 and MIPS64 ISAs are binary compatible. The bulk of the effort in the migration to any new ISA is in the low-level initialization software. Our newARM architecture to MIPS and Power architecture to MIPS Migration Guides illustrate the ease of migration and highlight the areas that users need to focus on. The application code itself is typically coded in a high-level language that can be recompiled to the MIPS ISA. MIPS Technologies provides a rich portfolio of software tools that span from SoC bring-up to performance analysis tools for all popular operating systems. These robust software tools enable the user to optimize their application with very little effort.<query> what is mips architecture</query> But software is adapting – systems are getting much more complex, such that multiple processes and threads are running simultaneously in many cases, and applications are being written to take better advantage of multiprocessing hardware trends. With that in mind, we recently used the BrowsingBench™ benchmark from EEMBC to evaluate the performance benefits of MIPS’ multi-core (MC) and multi-threading (MT) technologies. Our objective was to find out how these technologies enhance the user experience of a very popular and very real consumer application – web browsing on the Android™ software platform. BrowsingBench is a credible and widely used tool that is trusted and cited by leading technology companies. It measures web page loading and rendering time for a large set of web pages with diverse content, and it does this in a reliable way which leads to repeatable and meaningful results.<query> what is mt in web browser</query> Several third party software tool vendors offer a variety of development kits with popular operating systems and a rich suite of tools that make migration straightforward. The breadth and the rich features of MIPS Technologies’ product portfolio, coupled with a flexible business model, enable MIPS licensees to create MIPS-Based products that range from 32-bit microcontrollers and energy efficient mobile devices to ‘green’ supercomputers and high-end networking infrastructure products.

LTE represents a greater than 50x increase in maximum user data from its 3G predecessor, W-CDMA, in its maximum configuration (of course, we all know that theoretical maximum data rates are never achieved, nevertheless, the point is still valid). Due to the real time nature of baseband data, this huge increase in data must still be processed in real time. So the only way for a baseband system to compensate for the increased throughput is to significantly decrease latency.<query> what is lte</query> For this reason, the Time Transmission Interval (TTI) for LTE is a mere 1ms, compared to 10ms for W-CDMA. TTI is essentially the length of time to transmit a block of data. Bottom line, the need to process and transmit more than an order-of-magnitude increase in data is creating significant performance demands on cellular baseband processors. This is also true of the next generation WiFi standard, 802.11ac, which promises 1Gbps of data. Typically, performance increases in both the user and control plane come from increasing the clock frequency of the processor. Of course, this is counter-productive to power consumption, which is why this is generally not favored in the first place. Hence, another alternative is to go multi-core, which is a common means of distributing the processing load to achieve higher performance without having to greatly increase the clock frequency.<query> what is tti</query> While this does increase static power consumption due to the increase in transistor count, it is less significant than the increased dynamic power consumption associated with doubling the clock frequency. Multi-core also has the downside of the potential additional licensing and royalties of the 2nd core, as well as the increased manufacturing cost from the greater die size. Fortunately, these are not the only possibilities. Another possibility is to use hardware multi-threading, which can made a processor core look like two cores, each of which could run an independent OS or RTOS. In this case, the processing load is distributed across what appears to the RTOS to be two cores. In the MIPS32® 34K® core, these are known as VPEs, or Virtual Processing Elements. With a multi-threaded core, the increase in die size is relatively small and there is no need to pay a license fee or royalties for a second core.<query> what is multithread processor</query> Furthermore, latency can be significantly decreased since threads can be parked and revived with a zero overhead context switch, hence achieving the two main technical requirements. One of our baseband customers simulated its multi-mode modem and found that with MIPS multi-threading, processor stalls were reduced by over 20%! All of this leads to an improved mobile device user experience, as responsiveness is greatly increased. The biggest downside to usage of hardware multi-threading is some increase of software complexity, and porting of legacy software. Software which runs single-threaded must be re-architected in order to fully exploit the benefits of multi-threading. While this is not a complete re-write, it can be substantial. Of course, the same is also true of multi-core, so software which supports multi-threading is an inevitability.<query> what is the benefit of multithreading</query> So regardless, this needs to be done. The exact level of effort depends largely on how well the code is structured (the more modular, the better), written, and documented. For a multi-mode modem, the code can be partitioned in a few different ways to exploit multi-threading while minimizing the porting cost. Stay tuned for my next post to learn more! So the answer to the question above is, of course, it depends. It depends on the application requirements, particularly the power threshold. But for mobile baseband processors, clearly multi-threading provides a solution that increases performance significantly in a much more power friendly manner than doubling the clock speed or going multi-core.

Posted in Uncategorized | 1 Comment » Nice Try, No Cigar June 16th, 2011 by Ian Anderton Yesterday Freescale announced that its Kinetis microcontroller achieves the highest CoreMark/MHz score of any Cortex-M class device.<query> what is multithreading</query> Whilst this announcement is an opportunity to bring out the bunting and set off a few fireworks in Austin, this news was met in Sunnyvale with a ‘Nice try, no cigar’. 2.119 CoreMark/MHz may be a credible result for a Cortex-M class microcontroller, but it falls well short of what an equivalent MIPS processor core can achieve. The MIPS32 M14K and M4K families of processor cores target similar market applications as Cortex-M. As I have detailed in the‘Beyond the Hype’ white paper and a previous blog post, the M14K and M4K cores, based on the standard MIPS architecture, have a higher operating performance than the Cortex-M series, in addition to having superior features, smaller area and lower power. So, how much better performance? Let’s take a look at some numbers.<query> what is the coremark of a mips processor</query> The M14K core operating in microMIPS mode (the 32-/16-bit code compression-enabled ISA) achieves a 2.56 CoreMark/MHz score—20% higher performance than Kinetis. The PIC32 MCU family from Microchip (based on the M4K core) achieves a 2.51 CoreMark/MHz score, an 18% increase in performance relative to Kinetis operating at the same clock frequency. Why do MIPS processors outperform their equivalent ARM counterparts across the complete product range? Well, Watson, it all comes down to MIPS having a better, more efficient architecture – something it is well known for. Comparing MIPS and ARM architectures highlights some interesting facts on how MIPS is able to achieve better performance and higher frequencies. MIPS has: • 32 general purpose registers (ARM only has 16) • Mostly single-operation instructions (with ARM, many operations require multiple instructions to complete) • Less predicated execution than ARM • Simpler memory addressing modes, and fewer executing modes than ARM • Shadow register sets (ARM does not have these) ….and so on.<query> what is the difference between a mips and an arm</query> For more information about these attributes, check out the whitepaperhere. Other MIPS cores also make use of a unique multi-threading capability, which further increases efficiency compared to ARM cores. In addition, the M14K and M4K processor cores are designed with a 5-stage pipeline execution unit; Cortex-M cores implement only a 3-stage pipeline architecture. This is another key feature which contributes to MIPS’ high performance. Running the Dhrystone benchmark results in M14K (in microMIPS mode) producing 1.48 DMIPS/MHz, while Cortex-M3 (and the M4 implemented in the Freescale Kinetis device) only achieves a max 1.25 DMIPS/MHz. Now, back to EEMBC CoreMark, where we started this discussion… CoreMark is an interesting and useful benchmark because it is aimed at benchmarking the performance of the processor core specifically.<query> what is the performance of a mips core</query> CoreMark analyzes and scores the processor pipeline structure and efficiency, performing three main tasks that test its execution of commonly used operations. Importantly, the CoreMark test is written such that it isolates the processor from memory influences. CoreMark is quickly becoming an industry standard benchmark for measuring and comparing processor performance. The higher the CoreMark number, the higher the performance. Pass me the box of cigars please.

And rather than performing a synthetic test, BrowsingBench performs the same operations which a human would perform on the device. We’ve used several other benchmarks in the past that were suitable for evaluating MC/MT system performance; however none represented the real-world user experience on connected devices as well as BrowsingBench. We ran BrowsingBench on a system based on the MIPS32® 1004K™ Coherent Processing System (CPS). In its maximum implementation, the 1004K CPS can support up to four cores and two hardware threads (also known as Virtual Processing Elements or VPEs) per core. To keep things simple for this test however, the configuration we used was dual core with two VPEs per core, for a total of 4 VPEs. VPEs are essentially logical CPUs that share one physical pipeline in each 1004K core, based on MIPS’ multi-threading technology.<query> what is the cps of mips</query> MIPS Moves Quickly with Android 4.0.3 and LLVM Convergence with a Caveat: Will the TV, tablet, smartphone and computer converge into one master device?

To evaluate the benefits of multiple cores and VPEs on web browser performance, we ran BrowsingBench using the 4 different configurations listed in the table below. In all cases, the tests were executed on the same dual-core 1004K system; however we used the operating system to enable and disable cores and VPEs. The big question we wanted to answer was whether Android would be able to take advantage of these multiple processing resources to load and render web pages faster, thereby enhancing the user experience. To do that, Android would have to use parallel processes and threads while executing the browsing workload. The results, which are shown in the table and chart below, leave no doubt: Android based web browsing performance is greatly enhanced by MC and MT technologies.<query> what is the difference between mc and vpe</query> The main observation is that browsing performance improves more than 2.5x when comparing the full configuration to the basic configuration. With a great deal of parallel execution under Android, the browser can truly benefit from the combination of MT and MC. A closer look at what’s happening under the hood in the Android system indeed shows that a lot of processes are running in parallel. The two main processes in the system are the Android Browser itself and another process called “system server,” which manages many components of Android including the display system, and is kept very busy during the BrowsingBench run. Even if we limit the system to a single core, the MIPS MT technology gives us a BrowsingBench performance boost of 43 percent. One of the primary attributes of MT is to improve performance efficiency of a core, which it does by increasing the pipeline utilization of that core when multiple processes and/or threads are running.<query> what is mt in android</query> So for systems where silicon real estate is at a premium, choosing a multithreaded core can be a great way to boost system performance. When multi-core and multi-threading systems were first introduced into the marketplace, most existing software was not optimized to make good use of these technologies. Today this is changing. Android is a complex software platform, and a perfect example of a high volume consumer platform that is quickly evolving and being optimized for optimal user experience in a Web-connected world. At MIPS we are very pleased with the benchmark results because they demonstrate that our MC and MT technologies deliver much higher performance than the standard hardware used only a few years ago, and make a significant impact to end users of many connected devices from smart phones and tablets to connected DTVs.

So yeah, Google is my primary research tool. It's also my mother's. Collectively, our dependence on Google is not a problem because it allegedly weakens our faculties. It's a problem because Google bakes biases into its algorithms. And we fail to recognize that fact. Most of the time, we can't even discern what they are. Most of the recent changes in Google's search algorithms make Google much better for shopping and much worse for learning. That could make us collectively dumber, but not individually. That's why we need a fresh approach to how we manage our information ecosystem. The same service cannot serve wisdom and wealth equally well. I'm sorry. What was the question?<query> why is google a problem</query> I got distracted by YouTube for a moment... Q: At a digital scholarship conference last fall, I watched Daniel M. Russell, a senior research scientist at Google in charge of “user happiness,” give an academic audience a demonstration of what treasures lie in the depths of Google’s trove — a facsimile of Stravinsky’s score from “Sacre du Printemps,” a 3-D model of the Notre Dame Cathedral, unemployment data for Santa Clara County over the last 20 years — before lamenting that most students have no idea how to find them. The implication was that Google has created this rich, open vault that students love to use but which colleges are failing to teach them to use effectively. To what extent can better training and education realistically solve this problem? A: Well, I am not sure training is the gap here.<query> who is daniel russell</query> Google keeps rolling out cool features and services faster than we can fold them into our habits and curricula. A couple of weeks ago Google unveiled a really cool high-definition tool to explore major art works in museums. Every day I plan to use it to show my daughter some of her favorite works. But every evening I forget to do that because I just can't get out of the tangle of links connecting YouTube videos. Google has not figured out how to connect with the right faculty in the right numbers for many of its services. But it's not really Google's fault. Perhaps each university should assign a librarian to be the Chief Google Officer so she or he could hip faculty to the newest, coolest things. Q: Lest our readers assume that your book is a frothing, techno-phobic screed penned by a dyed-in-the-tweed academic who lives to prove that any large, profitable company is necessarily sinister and exploitative, I should mention that you actually have some quite nice things to say about Google in these pages.<query> why is google not hiring a librarian</query> What is the greatest contribution Google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life? A: Google made the Web usable. Before this clean and useful search tool, using the Web well meant starting at a trusted point and following trusted links. That's why it is called a ""web."" With decent search one can just drop down into a new part of the Web, skipping over the useless and icky parts. Google actually cleaned up the Web — or at least our experience of it. Not long ago simple searches for double entendres like ""facial"" would yield anything but links to the cosmetic spa treatment. Google's biases — what it calls standards — effectively hide the most troublesome links deep in the search results. You can find the yucky stuff by searching for exactly what you might want.<query> what is the greatest contribution google has made to higher education and/or intellectual life?</query> But you are unlikely to stumble upon bad stuff accidentally. This is a great service, but one with real costs at the margins. Beyond that, Google Docs is a major service to higher education. It's the easiest and most dependable way to allow multiple authors and editors to work on a document together. It lacks the useless gizmos that infect Microsoft Office. I use the Google Docs presentation software to run slides for class because it's simple, dependable, and can host embedded YouTube videos. Did I mention that I spend too much time on YouTube? That said, I believe it's incumbent on universities to ensure maximum user confidentiality and data security for any Google product. I don't believe universities have been strong or effective negotiators for their students' and faculties' interests when it comes to using Google services.<query> why use google docs</query> There should be a collective set of best practices for when universities deploy third-party services that collect user data. Q: Your book culminates with a proposal for an alternative to Google’s “hyper-commercialized, data-mined, advertising-directed” model — working title: the Human Knowledge Project. Contrary to Google, this project would set the agenda for the creation of a information system that is public, comprehensive, civic-minded, and strong enough to outlast its colorful, colossal counterpart. How plausible is it that a confederation of relatively cash-poor and fractious public institutions might actually shoulder the resolve and unity of vision to field a more stable alternative to Google? Does any part of you fear that what “the Googlization of everything” has taken from humanity, humanity lacks the will to reclaim?<query> what is the human knowledge project</query> A: The Human Knowledge Project would be a 50-year public, global plan to design, legislate for, enable, and fund a global digital library service to deliver the best information to the most people. It's as feasible as it is desirable. In other words, if we don't do it it's because we don't really want it. States are only as cash-poor as they choose to be. States are only as incompetent as they are designed to be. The fractured nature of public discourse could be the source of strength for such a project as long as we all agree on the terms of debate and the over-arching goal: that no child growing up in Sweden should have better access to better information than a child growing up in Rwanda would have. If we don't agree to that, then we should not pursue the Human Knowledge Project.<query> why is the human knowledge project not feasible</query> If we do agree, then let's start a political campaign for it. Let's figure out the steps we need to take. Let's change the laws we need to change. Let's raise the money we need to raise. The goal would not be to oust or push Google. The goal would be to build what we want and need without resorting to cheap, short-term fixes.

Later, Page and Brin would rely on university largesse in the early days of the Google Book Search project, when major research libraries allowed the company to scan huge portions of their collections for free. In return, Google has given higher education Google Scholar, which provides a popular bridge to otherwise obscure academic research; Google Apps for Education, which enables universities to use the company’s e-mail and communications tools, and its huge server capacity, for free; and, of course, Google Book Search — which, despite its discomfiting monopoly, gives scholars a more comprehensive body of digitized literature than has ever existed.<query> who is google founder</query> “Google,” Vaidhyanathan observes, “is an example of a stunningly successful firm behaving as much like a university as it can afford to.” But as is often the case with cousins, the genetic differences between higher education and Google are more striking than their similarities. Beneath the interdependence and shared hereditary traits, tensions creep. And like an awkward Thanksgiving dinner, Vaidhyanathan’s new book,The Googlization of Everything (And Why We Should Worry) (University of California Press), provokes these tensions to the surface. The Virginia professor, who is not afraid to confess his affection for the ease and usefulness of Google, nevertheless distrusts the company’s basic motivations as it vies for our intellectual inheritance. “Google has fostered a more seamless, democratized, global, cosmopolitan information ecosystem,” he writes. “Yet it has simultaneously contributed to the steady commercialization of higher education and the erosion of standards of information quality.” Google does not reward our impulse to know, Vaidhyanathan argues; it exploits it by making it appear as though knowing is easy.<query> who is google professor</query> “The ways that Google structures, judges, and delivers knowledge to us exacerbate our worst tendencies to jump to erroneous conclusions and act on them in ways that cause harm,” the professor writes. Meanwhile the company keeps collecting, on behalf of its advertisers, the wealth of personal information that we feed it in exchange for this flattery, then pats its own back all the way to the bank. Vaidhyanathan’s point is not that Google has scammed us. He attributes the ascension of Google to a “public failure” — negligence by public stewards to preempt the privatization of knowledge and learning in the switch from analog to digital. In other words, we should have seen this coming. Did Google’s academic bloodlines lull higher education into passively supporting Page and Brin as they quietly absconded with the family jewels? Perhaps, but Vaidhyanathan is less concerned with how we got here than where we are and where we’re going.<query> who is google</query> Accordingly, he proposes a sprawling effort by libraries and like-minded institutions that would essentially give Googlers a public option. “The future of knowledge — and thus the future of the species — depends on our getting this right,” he writes. Inside Higher Ed caught up with Vaidhyanathan, whose Wikipedia page credits him with coining the term “Critical Information Studies,” though it does not cite its source. Q: You admit early on that your book has an “overtly political” agenda: greater government regulation of Google. When a company exerts such control over public goods — like, say, a digital archive of 130 million books comprising the entire living history of human thought — oversight by public authorities becomes necessary, you argue. One might counter that public institutions are potentially just as compromising.<query> who coined the term critical information studies?</query> To the extent that regulation would transfer power over the basic infrastructure of knowledge and learning from Google to the government, might we simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization? A: While I argue that we should consider — not fear — the prospect of regulating Google, I stop short of prescribing much in the way of specific regulation. My goal is to convince readers that Google is already highly regulated, so it's dumb to say that Google should remain unregulated. More importantly, I want to raise the prospect of whether Google and the Internet in general are properly regulated. That, to me, is the grown-up way to approach the question. Right now Google is haphazardly and clumsily regulated. Copyright stops Google and others from doing clever, useful things. Antitrust is too toothless to provide serious competition in online, search-based advertisements.<query> why is google unregulated</query> Most important from the perspective of the values important to a democratic republic, Google's search standards are opaque and potentially corrupt. That's whythe European Union is examining them. I don't believe Google's search results are corrupted. I do believe they very well could be in the near future. And there is no guarantee that the next company that governs search would be named Google. As to the direct questions about whether the transfer of authority from firm to state would ""simply be trading the hazards of commercialization for the hazards of politicization,"" I say exactly! Politicization means that citizens battle over competing visions of the good. That's what we are supposed to do in a democratic republic. Fundamentally, we must recognize that some things are too important to be entrusted to unaccountable private actors. There may be hazards.<query> why is google search corrupt</query> But they are our hazards. Q: As you write, it is not just our institutions that are being “Googlized”; so are our minds and habits. Some surveys have suggested that nearly half of college students use Google as their primary research tool. “Googlized” students have poor memories and inflated expectations about how much effort it takes to dig up definitive answers. A Greek chorus of tsk-ing academics has all but declared this a preamble to the Twitter-apocalypse. Are they right? A: I don't subscribe to the ""Google is making us dumber"" position.

See more stories » X In China, once-thriving Apple scalpers are struggling By Deborah Netburn March 15, 2012, 1:24 p.m. Back in the day, watching television was as simple as hitting a switch, maybe messing with some rabbit ears and flipping through all eight of your channel choices. The sound wasn't so great, and the picture was kind of grainy, but at least it was simple.<query> who is the director of google</query> If a friend was going to stay at your house for a week, you wouldn't have to prepare a four-page document on how to watch""30 Rock."" In our more technologically advanced age, however, simply turning on a home entertainment system can involve as many as three remote controls. Once your set is finally on, you're faced with an interface that is ugly and cluttered and hard to read. And watching live television means scrolling through hundreds of channels, some that you don't even have access to, others that are in languages that you don't understand. It's enough to make a person abandon her 52-inch hi-def LED screen and just watch her shows on a laptop. Somebody upgrade us! Well, both Google and Apple are working on it. So far both companies offer additional boxes you can attach to your television.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a tv</query> ButSony is selling a television with Google TV built right in, and if you can believe the Internet rumors, Apple may be launching its own television set later this year. Here's what we'd like to see: 1. One -- singular -- remote: At our house, turning on the television involves taking one remote and pressing ""TV"" then ""Power"" then ""Cable"" and ""Power,"" then turning to a second remote that controls the Blu-ray and sound system. If we want to useNetflix, we pull out the remote to our Wii. There has to be a better way! 2. A more intuitive remote: There are way too many buttons on most remotes, and the important ones like ""Power"" and ""Function"" are often not in the most obvious places.<query> what is the remote for tv</query> This needs to change. 3. One device: We don't want a television and a Blu-ray player and a cable box that we have to rent and some sort of video game system that also allows us to access Amazon Prime andNetflix and Hulu. We'd like one simple device, please -- easy to set up, easy to move, easy to control. 3. A better-looking interface: Oh, that grid! That horrible looking grid! It's so ugly and it's so difficult to read. Our giant, high-definition television sets are crying out for a graphic interface -- streamingNetflix has the right idea. It's nice to look at and easy to use. 4. A la carte channels: How many channels do you watch on a regular basis? Five? Ten?<query> what is the best streaming device</query> Maybe 20? And how many channels are bundled into your cable deal? Probably more than 100. We don't need that many channels and most of us are finally realizing that we don't want that many either. What if you could pay to subscribe toCNN, ESPN and HBO and that's it? 5. An easy to use favorites list: For those who aren't ready to give up their 500-channel deal, there should be easy an way to create a favorites list. Imagine dragging and dropping your top 20 channels into your own favorites list. Dreamy! 6. Content options in one place: There are a lot of ways to watch television and movies now -- Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime. We want our new television to have all those viewing options built right into it -- no cables or extra wires, or extra devices, necessary.<query> how many channels are on tv</query> 7. No more storage limits: The ability to digitally record a show has redefined television watching for many people, but serious watchers frequently run out of memory on their devices. We'd like to get rid of the idea of storing television shows, and instead have those shows live somewhere in a cloud so that we don't have to worry about watch it now, or lose it. 8. A universal system: Watching television at your mom's house is nothing like watching television at your own house. We are capable of jumping on someone else's computer to check email real quick if necessary; we should also be capable of turning on someone else's television with out an instruction manual. 9. Self set-up:The last time we moved, we waited 10 days for our cable company to finally get us cable TV.<query> what is the best way to watch tv</query> And we aren't alone. Remember that infinitely satisfying""Seinfeld"" episode when Kramer finally got to make the cable guy wait? We'd like our children to shake their heads in wonderment that it ever took more than an hour to get a television set up and working. 10. Headphones: Well, this might just be us, but we always thought that wireless headphones would be a great addition to any television set. That way, you can watch as loud as you want and not worry about bugging the neighbors. ALSO: Apple shares hit $600 ahead of new iPad release Man sues Apple over Siri ads: Does he have a case?

clueweb12-1019wb-44-02493,88,1,"A second aspect of training is one that cannot be gained from the courses or seminars. This is firsthand knowledge of, and practical experience with, the methods of psychological investigation and study. These methods include ways of behaving with the subjects being studied. Students are provided with whatever opportunities they need to reach those levels of competence representative of doctoral standing. Continuing research programs, sponsored by members of the faculty, offer direct opportunities for experience in fields represented by the faculty's many research interests. Each student achieves competence in unique ways and at different rates. Each student and adviser share in planning a program leading to the objectives discussed. The student is expected to spend half of his or her time on research and takes no more than 10 units of course work per quarter. For further information please contact the student services office and the department graduate guide.<query> what is the purpose of continuing research programs</query> TEACHING REQUIREMENT The department views experience in supervised teaching as an integral part of its graduate program. Regardless of the source of financial support, all students serve as teaching assistants for at least five Psychology courses during their graduate study. Of the courses, two must be PSYCH 1, Introduction to Psychology, or PSYCH 10, 252 or 253, Statistical Methods. Students are discouraged from participating in teaching during the first year of graduate study. Students typically progress from closely supervised teaching to more independent work. Some students may be invited to offer a supervised, but essentially independent, seminar during their final year of graduate study. PSYCHOLOGY COLLOQUIUM The Psychology Colloquium meets on most Wednesday afternoons at 3:45 p.m. Speakers from Stanford and other institutions present topics of current interest. Graduate students are expected to attend. Additional announcements may be found athttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/colloquium.<query> what is the stanford psychology teaching requirement</query> Copyright ©2011 Stanford University | Office of the University Registrar | Academic Year 2011-12 | Terms of Use | Copyright Complaints | Report a Problem with this site.<query> what year is stanford university</query> However, an applicant should have research experience as an undergraduate, as well as the equivalent of an undergraduate major in Psychology. The major focus of the doctoral program is on research training, and admission is highly selective. Applicants for admission must submit their scores on the general Graduate Record Examination as part of the application. GRE subject scores are recommended. General University requirements for the Ph.D. are described in the "" Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. In addition to fulfilling Stanford University requirements for the degree, the following departmental requirements are stipulated. First-Year Course Requirements—During the first year of graduate study, the student must take PSYCH 207, Proseminar for First-Year Ph.D. Graduate Students, at least one approved graduate statistics course, and at least two core courses from the following list: PSYCH 202.<query> what is the requirements for a phd degree</query> Neuroscience PSYCH 205. Foundations of Cognition PSYCH 211. Developmental Psychology PSYCH 212. Social Psychology or PSYCH 215. Mind, Culture, and Society PSYCH 213. Affective Science Students in each area may be required to take up to two additional non-core graduate courses in their area of specialization. The student is expected to spend at least half of the time in research from the beginning of the first year of graduate study to the completion of the Ph.D., taking no more than 10 units of course work each quarter. At the end of the first year of graduate study, the student must file with the department a written report of the first-year research activities. Second Year Course Requirements—By the end of the second year of graduate study, the student should complete the core courses listed above and take a second approved graduate course in statistics.<query> what courses are required for phd</query> Third-Year and Beyond—Students are expected to form a research committee, which must include the dissertation reading committee, before the initiation of the dissertation research. The research committee includes the dissertation adviser and consists of at least three faculty members, at least two of whom should have primary appointments in the Psychology department. For University guidelines for the composition of the dissertation reading committee, see the ""Graduate Degrees"" section of this bulletin. The research committee should meet no later than the last day of classes of Spring Quarter of the third year, and determines the timeline for further development of the dissertation research project. Subsequent meetings are triggered by the completion of one of two documents: a dissertation proposal (DP) or a conceptual analysis of the dissertation area (CADA). The timing and sequencing of the DP and CADA are developed by the student in consultation with the committee.<query> what is the purpose of a research committee</query> As a general guide, one of the two preliminary elements (CADA or DP) should be completed by the end of the third Summer Quarter and the second should be completed by the end of the fourth Spring Quarter. Students are free to alter the membership of the committee at any time during the process, subject to consultation with the adviser. The DP should be a description of the proposed research. The CADA provides a framework for the research topic of the dissertation, addresses the central issues within the specialty area, and reviews the pertinent literature. Advanced Course or Minor Requirements—The candidate must complete 12 units of advanced graduate course work or a Ph.D. minor in another department. If a student waives the minor requirement in favor of the 12 advanced units, the student must fulfill the advanced course requirement by taking (a) non-core graduate courses required by a particular area,or (b) graduate-level courses in other departments comparable in quality to Psychology's graduate courses.<query> what is the cada</query> If there is any question about comparability, the student should consult the adviser, student services, and, in some cases, the graduate program committee chair before taking the course. Orals—The candidate must pass the University oral examination, which also serves as a dissertation defense. A committee is formed to review the oral examination, including the dissertation reading committee, an additional faculty member, and one oral examination committee chair from outside the Psychology department. The oral examination consists of a 40-45-minute presentation to the department of the completed dissertation research. Parents and friends are welcome to attend. Following the presentation, the student and the committee convene for a discussion of the dissertation and the presentation. Dissertation Requirements—The candidate must complete a dissertation satisfactory to the dissertation reading committee prior to the oral examination. Minor revisions to formatting may be made after the oral examination.<query> how long is the oral examination</query> Ph.D. candidacy expires five years after admission to candidacy at the end of the second year of study. Reapplication requires department reexamination. STUDENT EVALUATIONS First-Year Evaluation—It is the department's policy to evaluate the progress of each graduate student at the end of the first year of graduate study. As part of the procedure, each student is required to file with the department a report of the first-year research activities. Students should discuss this report and the evaluation procedures with their adviser as early as possible in their first year. If the student fulfills the academic promise displayed upon entrance, he or she is invited to continue working towards the doctorate. The first-year evaluation is primarily based on three factors: quality of research carried out in the first year performance in courses (especially required courses) recommendations of the adviser (including a commitment on the part of that adviser to continue in that role).<query> how long does a phd candidate have to be evaluated</query> Second-Year and Beyond Evaluation—A similar evaluation is conducted at the end of each year of graduate training involving the same criteria as the first year; however, the student is not required to submit a paper. Students who are not making satisfactory progress may be dropped from the program. THE DOCTORAL TRAINING PROGRAM As indicated by the requirements described above, a student concentrates in any one of several areas within Psychology. Regardless of area, however, the training program places emphasis on the development of research competence, and students are encouraged to develop those skills and attitudes that are appropriate to a career of continuing research productivity. Two kinds of experience are necessary for this purpose. One is the learning of substantial amounts of technical information. A number of courses and seminars are provided to assist in this learning, and a student is expected to work out a program, with his or her adviser, to attain this knowledge in the most stimulating and economical fashion.<query> what is the purpose of a doctoral training program</query>"

Normally, at least four hours of independent learning should be in psychology. PSYC 380 Fieldwork in a Psychological Setting is a full-year course that meets the all-College requirement for independent learning, as do any two PSYC 350 courses. Alternatively, one course from the upper level research category may be counted as independent learning, provided it is followed by related work in PSYC 350. The following five core courses are required: PSYC 101 Introduction to Psychological Science MATH 118 Introductory Statistics PSYC 201 Biological Psychology PSYC 203 Research Methods in Psychology PSYC 345 History and Systems of Psychology To ensure that students receive sufficient breadth across substantive areas, as well as some depth within at least one area, the department also requires that students successfully complete at least one course chosen from each of the following five areas: Basic Processes PSYC 232 Health Psychology PSYC 243 Cognitive Psychology PSYC 244 Drugs and Behavior PSYC 247 Perception Social and Developmental PSYC 235 Developmental Psychology PSYC 236 Psychology of Adolescence PSYC 239 Psychology of Aging PSYC 248 Social Psychology Clinical and Personality PSYC 230 Theories of Personality PSYC 231 Abnormal Psychology Upper Level Theory and Application PSYC 331 Seminar in Clinical Psychology PSYC 335 Social and Emotional Development PSYC 336 Childhood Psychopathology PSYC 339 Psychology and the Law Upper Level Research PSYC 301 Research in Biopsychology PSYC 303 Research in Cognitive Processes PSYC 304 Research in Personality PSYC 305 Research in Cognitive Development PSYC 308 Research in Social Psychology Prerequisites: PSYC 101, Introduction to PSYC 101, Introduction to Psychological Science, is a prerequisite for all courses offered by the department except PSYC 220, for which the prerequisite is PSYC 101 or WGST 100.<query> what is the psyc requirement for independent learning</query> Upper-level courses have additional prerequisites as detailed in the course descriptions. Recommendations: Students considering a major in psychology are advised to take PSYC 101 Introduction to Psychological Science during their first year and MATH 118 Introductory Statistics in the fall semester of their sophomore year. In general, the department encourages flexible and individualized course planning both within and beyond the field of psychology. The chair or an advisor in the department can help with such program planning. The following examples serve as guides to planning an appropriate program. A student planning a career working with children, such as early childhood education, counseling, child guidance, or school psychology, should consider PSYC 235, 236, 305, 335, and 336. A student planning a career in a medical or physiological research setting should consider PSYC 232, 243, 244, 247, and 301.<query> what courses are required for psychology</query> Relevant courses in biology, chemistry, and computer science are also recommended. A student interested in a career in behavioral research, human factors, or computer-based instruction should consider PSYC 243, 247, 248, and 303. Relevant areas of mathematics and/or computer science are also recommended. A student with career interests in the clinical and personality area should consider PSYC 230, 231, 232, 304, 331, 336, and 339. A student planning a career in social service or human resources should consider PSYC 230, 231, 232, 248, 308, and 339.

The physical therapist talks to the patient and evaluates their condition by testing joint motion, muscle strength, cardiovascular function, reflexes, and functional skills. If a physician referred the patient, the therapist will review the prescription along with the patient's records.<query> what is the difference between a physical therapist and a physical therapist</query> After necessary information has been gathered, the physical therapist designs a treatment plan to fit the patient's needs and goals. The therapist and patient will work together as a team toward wellness. Is physical therapy painful? Sometimes PT is uncomfortable or painful. However, the therapist has treatments available that can help minimize pain. As muscles are stretched and exercised, it is only natural to experience some soreness. As therapy progresses, range of motion increases, strength and soreness diminishes. In general, patients feel better following therapy and look forward to the next session. How long does a therapy session last? The amount of time needed depends on the type of therapy involved. For example, it may take one patient longer to complete their therapeutic exercises than another. Also, as a patient makes progress, their treatment plan is adjusted.<query> how long does physical therapy last</query> Updated on: 01/12/10 About Physical Therapy Physical Therapy Overview Education and Training How to Select a Physical Therapist Conditions Treated with PT Questions to Ask Your Physical Therapist Physical Therapy Treatments Exercise Hot and Cold Therapies Hydrotherapy (Aquatic Therapy) McKenzie Method Massage TENS Ultrasound Resources Spinal Anatomy Spinal Conditions A-Z Videos and Animations Treatment Update Could my low back pain be SI-joint related?

Exercise is one of the main methods employed inphysical therapy. PT is one of the most commonly used conservative care approaches for a range of dorsopathy issues, including chronic pain management, as well as postoperative and injury rehabilitation applications. Therapists provide services that help restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain and prevent physicaldisabilities in patients suffering or recovering from back ache. Appropriate treatment will help to increase the range of motion, flexibility, and strength of theback muscles, as well as improve overall health. Advertisement: Exercises for Back Pain / Therapists A physical therapist (PT) is a healthcare professional who has completed 6 years of schooling on average and possibly more.<query> what is the best exercise for back pain</query> Many of today’s therapists continue their education until they earn a Doctorate degree. Physical therapists must pass an exam to be licensed, and must be licensed in order to practice. Physical therapy assistants (PTA) do not have such an extensive education and help assist the PT in actually working with the patient. Many patients develop a very close bond with their therapist and trust them deeply. PT work is very hands-on, making it exceptional in the relatively impersonal back pain industry. Amateur Exercises for Back Pain Exercise can be performed by the patient alone and does not need to be a systemic program to be effective. In fact, random and variable forms of exercise can be just as rewarding as the most well designed and comprehensive professional programs of physical activity. Exercises can also be done with the assistance of a qualified fitness trainer.<query> what is the difference between a physical therapist and a physical therapy assistant</query> There are numerous books on back exercises available. Many of these books are written by the very best physical therapists practicing today. The patient must be sure that they know what they are doing, or else they risk making their back pain worse, rather than helping to relieve it. If there is any doubt, it would be wise to consult a therapist or doctor before starting any exercise program. Exercises for Back Pain Indications Exercise therapy is a great help for people who have been limited in their physical activity for a long time due tochronic back pain. However, physical therapy or back pain exercises alone typically will not provide a cure. In fact, they are forms ofsymptomatic treatment in the short term and might even perpetuate certain types of pain conditions in the long run. Generally, the positive effects of exercise and physical therapy will improve the condition of the back muscles, making them stronger, more flexible and healthier, but will not change the anatomy of the spine.<query> what kind of exercise is good for back pain</query> Exercise therapy is a good addition to back care treatment program, but only if there is work being done towards a real cure. If no cure is in sight, exercise therapy joins the long list of endless treatments that generally only succeed in prolonging thepainful back problem. Exercises for Back Pain Advice Remember that exercise increases cellular oxygenation and will relieve the symptoms ofischemia temporarily. Patients accurately diagnosed with structural forms of spinal pain are less likely to enjoy the benefits of exercise as a pain relief modality. However, many patients who do experience exercise benefits are oftenmisdiagnosed. Exercise therapy is great for recovering from aback injury or spinal surgery. Try not to wind up in a long-term treatment program of physical therapy or any other symptomatic treatment, unless a goal is set and is attainable. While I am a strong advocate of all manner of exercises, I do not see great statistical curative results when these modalities are used specifically to treat back pain.<query> what is exercise therapy for back pain</query> In too many cases, the patient is referred for PT over and over for purely economic gain of the care providers and does not see any tangible or lasting benefits at all. It is time to put an end to this type of callous treatment. Many patients would be better saving the effort spent performing some of these exercises and concentrating more on learning the facts of why their pain has not resolved. Research your diagnosis and use the knowledge to overcome the pain once and for all. Then and only then can you view exercise in its ideal form... unrestricted and healthy, performed without fear of injury, for the pure joy of it!

clueweb12-0703wb-82-09177,55,1,"Physical Therapy to Relieve Upper Back Pain Conditions › Back Pain › Upper Back Pain › Text Size: A A A Physical Therapy to Relieve Upper Back Pain Written by Kamiah A. Walker; Reviewed by Jason M. Highsmith, MD Tweet Many cases of upper back pain are caused by muscle strain, particularly from poor posture. Going to physical therapy can help you address the underlying causes of your pain; a physical therapist will work with you to restore full, pain-free movement and help your body heal. You can also learn about how to minimize or avoid pain in the future. Most importantly for many upper back pain sufferers, a physical therapist can teach you good posture, if you need to learn that. It can be difficult to ""un-learn"" years of bad posture, but a physical therapist can work with you to learn what good posture feels like and how to maintain it throughout the day.<query> what kind of therapist treats upper back pain</query> Physical therapy includes both passive and active treatments. Passive treatments help to relax you and your body. They're called passive because you don't have to actively participate. Your physical therapy program may start with passive treatments as your body heals, but the goal is to get into active treatments. These are therapeutic exercises that strengthen your body and help prevent a recurrence of upper back pain. You may be interested in these related articles: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Massage Therapy Back Pain Research and Treatment Updates What is a Physical Therapist? Passive Treatments Your physical therapist may give you passive treatments. Deep tissue massage: This technique targets spasms and chronic muscle tension that perhaps builds up through daily life stress. You could also have spasms or muscle tension because of strains or sprains.<query> what is passive therapy</query> The therapist uses direct pressure and friction to try to release the tension in your soft tissues (ligaments, tendons, muscles). For upper back pain caused by soft tissue tension, massage is very beneficial. Hot and cold therapies: Your physical therapist will alternate between hot and cold therapies. By using heat, the physical therapist seeks to get more blood to the target area because an increased blood flow brings more oxygen and nutrients to that area. Blood is also needed to remove waste byproducts created by muscle spasms, and it also helps healing. Cold therapy, also called cryotherapy, slows circulation, helping to reduce inflammation, muscle spasms, and pain. You may have a cold pack placed on the target area or even be given an ice massage. Another cryotherapy option is a spray called fluoromethane that cools the tissues.<query> what is the difference between cold and hot therapy</query> After cold therapy, your therapist may work with you to stretch the affected muscles. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS ): A TENS machine stimulates your muscles through variable (but safe) intensities of electrical current. TENS helps reduce muscle spasms, and it may increase your body's production of endorphins (your natural painkillers). The TENS equipment your physical therapist uses is relatively large. However, a smaller machine for at at-home use is also available. Whether large or small, a TENS unit can be a helpful therapy. Ultrasound: By increasing blood circulation, an ultrasound helps reduce muscle spasms, cramping, swelling, stiffness, and pain. It does this by sending sound waves deep into your muscle tissues, creating a gentle heat that enhances circulation and healing. Active Treatments In the active part of physical therapy, your therapist will teach you various exercises to improve your flexibility, strength, core stability, and range of motion (how easily your joints move—especially important if the joints in your thoracic spine are causing problems).<query> what is tens therapy</query> Your physical therapy program is individualized, taking into consideration your health and history. Your exercises may not be suitable for another person with back pain, especially since your pain might not even be caused by the same condition. If needed, you will learn how to correct your posture and incorporate ergonomic principles into your daily activities. This is all part of the ""self-care"" or ""self-treatment"" aspect of physical therapy: Through physical therapy, you learn good habits and principles that enable you to take better care of your body. We know: It's difficult to kick bad habits that lead to upper back pain, particularly posture. For many people with upper back pain caused by poor posture, bad posture actually feelsright. The physical therapist can help you learn that good posture feelsbetter. Finally, the physical therapist may suggest a personalized exercise program because staying active is so important to spinal health.<query> what is physical therapy for back pain</query> Working out—doing both cardio work and strength training—can reduce the likelihood of another upper back pain episode. Plus, of course, you'll be improving your overall health. Updated on: 01/12/12 Continue Reading: Surgery for Upper Back Pain About Upper Back Pain What Is Upper Back Pain?

The attacks, by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the software assets can push their impact through Cyber Terrain – a dependency network of structural, spatial, functional and other domain-specific dependencies that exist among software assets and services, and reach the missions. In this presentation we will introduce a novel approach of assessing impact of cyber attacks on missions (business process) and describe the basic models and algorithms of the approach.<query> cyber security situation awareness and impact assessment</query> Dr. Gabriel Jakobson is the VP and Chief Scientist at Altusys Corp., a consulting firm specializing in the development of intelligent situation management technologies for defence and cyber security applications.

In 2009, their Scantegrity II voting system was used in the election of the mayor and city council members of Takoma Park, Maryland. This was an historic first time any end-to-end voter verifiable voting system with ballot privacy has been used in a binding governmental election. This week, absentee voters in Takoma Park, Maryland will have the option to cast their votes for mayor and city council using a new Internet voting system calledRemotegrity which uses the same approach of generating privacy preserving confirmation numbers that allow each voter to verify her vote is counted and anyone to verify that all the votes were counted correctly.<query> when was remotegrity used</query> Dr. Carback has played a significant role in helping Takoma Park adopt and use Scantegrity and Remotegrity in the municipal elections. Internet voting has been used to elect government officials before (for example, in Switzerland, Estonia, and Norway), but what is new here is that voters mail in paper ballots and use the Internet to independently verify that their votes have been received by the city and recorded correctly. Anyone can check online that the recorded votes were tallied correctly. Dr. Filip Zagorski, computer scientist at The George Washington University, explains ÒThrough the hybrid use of paper ballots and Internet verification, Remotegrity combines the best of both worlds to provide a very high degree of security even against malware and insider attack.Ó Portions of the underlying research in cryptography and secure server design were supported by the National Science Foundation and the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education.<query> what is remotegrity</query> Voters who have requested to vote by mail receive a ballot which they mark and mail in, but they can also verify their vote on-line in the Remotegrity system, without revealing how they voted. In future elections, the same online procedure may cast votes and physical mailing of paper ballots may be optional or omitted. The city will also use the Scantegrity voting system for voters who cast their ballot in person, as it did in 2009. The integrated Scantegrity and Remotegrity systems offer full end-to-end voter-verifiability, in which voters casting ballots from home or in person can verify that their votes were correctly cast, collected, and counted. Additionally, this year, the city will provide an audio interface for marking ballots. The interface, named Audiotegrity, developed by researchers at The George Washington University, will enable voters with difficulty marking paper ballots to mark ballots independently using an electronic interface.<query> what is remotegrity voting system</query> Mr. Noel Runyan, a usability and accessibility expert, provided pro bono design advice to the Audiotegrity team. With a grant from the federal Election Assistance Commission, and support from the non-profit Voting Systems Institute, researchers from UMBC will survey voters and election officials as well as conduct focus groups around their experiences using these new voting systems.

Yet humans have been able to read such text ever since we created language. Many have created a robust recognition programs, but some still suffer from not knowing where the text baseline is—that is, where the non-descending characters of a line of text end. In this talk, we will discuss what makes reading scene text so difficult, how we made a baseline detection algorithm to improve the results of scene text recognition systems, and how we used the scientific method to make our system as robust as possible in ten weeks.

Introduction proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end.<query> what is computer programming</query> Just to give you a feel for what programming is like in a high-level language, here's a program that greets us, pretending to know English. print [Hello world!] This is one of the simplest programs that can be written in most high-level languages. PRINT is a command in Logo When it is performed, it takes whatever follows it and displays it. The ""Hello world"" program is famous;checkout its description on Wikipedia by clicking here. In addition to commands, Logo has operators that output some sort of result. Although it's a bit contrived, here is a program that displays the product of a constant number (ten) and a random number in the range of zero through fourteen. print product 10 (random 15) In this code, the PRINT command's input is the output of the PRODUCT operator. PRODUCT multiplies whatever follows it by whatever follows that and outputs the result. So,PRODUCT needs two inputs. RANDOM is an operator that outputs a number that is greater than or equal to zero (0) and less than the number following it. So, PRODUCT gets its second input from the output of RANDOM.<query> what is the print command in logo</query> Confusing? Don't worry, we will get into the details of operators in lesson 8. Finally, here's an advanced snipet of a program written in Logo, just to give you a feeling for what it looks like. Here is a procedure definition for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers. to getMax :maxNum :numList if empty? : numList [output :maxNum] if greater? (first :numList) :maxNum [output getMax (first :numList) (butfirst :numList)] output getMax :maxNum (butfirst :numList) end Do not worry if this seems confusing. It will be a while before you will be writing anything like this. But, I want you to see that the words that make up the program's instructions and the instructions themselves are similar to English sentences, e.g., the first line and a half in the procedure are similar to the sentences: If the list of numbers to process is empty then output the maximum number processed.<query> what is the procedure for selecting the maximum number from a list of numbers</query> If the first number in the list is greater than the maximum number processed so far then ... So, a high-level programming language is *sort-of* like English, just one step closer to what the language a computer really understands looks like. Now let's move on to what a computer's native language looks like when it is given a symbolic representation. Programming Languages (Assembler Language) One step above a computer's native language is assembler language. In an assembler language, everything is given human-friendly symbolic names. The programmer works with operations that the microprocessor knows how to do, they have symbolic names. The microprocessor's registers and addresses in the computer's memory can also be given meaningful names by the programmer. This is actually a very big step over what a computer understands, but still tedious for writing a large program. Assembler language instructions still have a place for little snipits of software that need to interact directly with the microprocessor and/or those that are executed many, many, many times.<query> what language is used to write a program</query> Table 1.1 is an example of DEC PDP-10 assembler language, a function that returns the largest integer in a group of them, named NUMARY. The group contains NCOUNT elements. Label OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register Comment GETMAX: MOVSI T1 400000 ; init T1 to smallest integer MOVE T2 NCOUNT ; get number of array elements GTMAX2: SOJL T2 [POPJ P,] ; decr idx, if -1 then done CAMG T1 NUMARY (T2) ; skip if T1 > array element JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number MOVE T1 NUMARY (T2) ; T1 gets new max number JRST GTMAX2 ; continue with next number Table 1.1 I'm showing you this so that you will have a feel for how primitive computer instruction sets are. I'm not going to go into the details of every instruction. If you want to go through it in detail on your own, the PDP-10 Machine Language is detailed here.<query> what is the function of pdp</query> A few points I want to expose you to are the general kinds of things being done. moving objects (numbers) into the computer's registers - very fast temporary storage, decrementing the value in a register, comparing the contents of a register to some value in memory, and transfering control to an instruction that's not in the standard sequential order - down the page. So, as you've seen, higher-level programming languages provide similar functionality and in a form that is closer to the English language. But there is a problem with assembler language - it is unique for every computer architecture. Although most deskside and notebook computers these days use the Intel architecture, this is only recently the case. And... a variety of computer architectures are commonly used in game systems, smart phones, tablets, automobiles, appliances, etc... Ok, we are almost at a point where I can show you machine language, the *native* language of a computer. But for you to understand it, I'm going to have to explain how everything is represented in a computer.<query> what language is used in computers</query> Inside Computers - Bits and Pieces Your computer successfully creates the illusion that it contains photographs, letters, songs, and movies. All it really contains is bits, lots of them, patterned in ways you can't see. Your computer was designed to store just bits - all the files and folders and different kinds of data are illusions created by computer programmers. (Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, Harry Lewis, in ""Blown to Bits"") Basically, computer instructions perform operations on groups of bits. A bit is either on or off, like a lightbulb. Figure 1.1_a shows an open switch and a lightbulb that is off - just like a transistor in a computer represents a bit with the value: zero. Figure 1.1_b shows the switch in the closed position and the lightbulb is on, again just like a transistor in a computer representing a bit with the value: one.<query> what is the difference between a bit and a bit</query> Figure 1.1_a Figure 1.1_b A microprocessor, which is the heart of a computer, is very primitive but very fast. It takes groups of bits and moves around their contents, adds pairs of groups of bits together, subtracts one group of bits from another, compares a pair of groups, etc... - that sort of stuff. Inside a microprocessor, at a very low level, everything is simply a bunch of switches, also known as bits - things that are either on or off! Time to expand on how this is done; first let's explore how groups of bits can be used to form numbers. Numeric Representation With Bits There are only 10 different kinds of people in the world: those who know binary and those who don't. - Anonymous Computers are full of zillions of bits that are either on or off. The way we talk about the value of a bit in the electical engineering and computer science communities is first as a logical value (true if on, false if off) and secondly as a binary number (1 if the bit is on and 0 if it's off). Most bits in a computer are manipulated in groups, so we humans need a way to describe groups of bits, things/objects a computer manipulates. Today, bits are most often grouped in quantities of 8, 16, 32, and 64.<query> what is the microprocessor used for</query> Think about how you write down sequential numbers starting with zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc... Our decimal number system has ten symbols. In this sequential series, when we ran out of symbols, we combined them. You learned how to do this so long ago, in grade school, that today you just naturally think in terms of single digit numbers, then tens, hundreds, thousands, etc... The decimal number 1234 is one thousand, two hundreds, three tens, and four units. So, how does the binary number system used inside computers work? Well, with only two symbols, we would write the same sequential numbers as above: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011. The decimal number 1234 in binary is 10011010010. Since even reasonable numbers that we use all the time make for very long binary numbers, the bits are grouped in 3s and 4s which are simple to convert into numbers in the octal and hexadecimal number systems. For octal, we group three bits together. Take the binary equivilent of decimal 1234, 10011010010, and put spaces in between each group of three bits - starting at the right and going left.<query> what is the decimal number for 111</query> 10011010010 = 10 011 010 010 Now use the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (eight symbols, so OCTAL) to replace each group. 10 011 010 010 = 2 3 2 2 = 2322 The octal representations of the binary patterns are certainly easier to read, write, and remember than the binary counterparts. An even more compact representation can be achieved by grouping the bits in chunks of four and converting these to hexNumerals. When you group four bits together and use sixteen symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, A, B, C, D, E, and F) as their abbreviations, you have a hexadecimal representation.<query> what is the symbol for octal</query> 10011010010 = 100 1101 0010 = 4D2 As you continue to explore how computers work, you'll hear more about numbers expressed in octal and hex; these are just more manageable representations of binary information -the digital world. Table 1.2 compares the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems. Decimal Number in Binary in Octal in Hex 1 1 1 1 2 10 2 2 3 11 3 3 4 100 4 4 5 101 5 5 6 110 6 6 7 111 7 7 8 1000 10 8 9 1001 11 9 10 1010 12 A 11 1011 13 B 12 1100 14 C 13 1101 15 D 14 1110 16 E 15 1111 17 F 16 10000 20 10 Table 1.2 So, if the most common groupings of bits in a computer are 8, 16, 32, and 64, what kinds of numbers can these groups represent?<query> what is the hexadecimal number</query> pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Today, most people don't need to know how a computer works. Most people can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone and point at some little graphical object on the display, click a button or swipe a finger or two, and the computer does something. An example would be to get weather information from the net and display it. How to interact with a computer program is all the average person needs to know. But, since you are going to learn how to write computer programs, you need to know a little bit about how a computer works. Your job will be to instruct the computer to do things. Basically, writing software (computer programs) is describing how to do something. In its simplest form, it is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something - aprocess, a procedure. The lists of instructions that you will write are computer programs, and the stuff that these instructions manipulate are different types of objects, e.g., numbers, words, graphics, etc...<query> what is the definition of procedure</query> A group of eight bits has binary values 00000000 through 11111111, or expressed in decimal 0 through 255. A group of sixteen bits has binary values 0000000000000000 through 1111111111111111, or decimal 0 through 65535. I'm not going to type in binary representations for groups of 32 and 64 bits. The range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits is 0 through 4,294,967,295. The range of decimal values for a group of 64 bits is 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -or almost eighteen and a half quintillion. But wait... these numbers are all positive (Whole Numbers). If we are going to allow for subtraction operations on numbers, which can result in negative numbers, we need Integers. Modern computers use one bit in each of the groups to represent the sign (positive or negative) when the groups are used to represent integers. Table 1.3 shows the range of numbers that can be represented with groups of 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits.<query> what is the range of decimal values for a group of 32 bits</query> Number of Bits Unsigned Maximum Value Signed Minimum Value Signed Maximum Value 8 255 -128 127 16 65535 -32768 32767 32 4,294,967,295 -2,147,483,648 2,147,483,647 64 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Table 1.3 That's about as deep as I want to get into the representation of numbers in computers and the binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems. Yes, computers have division operators but I am not going to cover numbers that include fractional parts, i.e., the""rational"" and ""irrational"" numbers due to the complexity of their implementations. If you want to read more, I googled and found what looks like a good place for you to read more. Start atAll About Circuits - Systems of numeration and read through it and continue on for a few more web pages in the series.<query> what is the number of bits in a hexadecimal number</query> Symbols as Bits - ASCII Characters Ok, so numbers are simply groups of bits. What other objects will the computer's instructions manipulate? How about the symbols that make up an alphabet? It should come as no surprise that symbols that make up alphabets are just numbers, groups of bits, too. But how do we know which numbers are used to represent which symbols, or characters as I'm going to call them from this point on? It's all about standards. In these lessons, we will use the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) standard. It is so ubiquious that it even has its own web page,www.asciitable.com. Let's walk through a couple of examples, entries in the table. Here are some characters, their decimal value and their binary value which is then transformed into an octal number.<query> what is the ascii symbol</query> Uppercase 'A' = decimal 65 = binary 01000001 = 01 000 001 = octal 101 Uppercase 'Z' = decimal 90 = binary 01011010 = 01 011 010 = octal 132 The digit '1' = decimal 49 = binary 00110001 = 00 110 001 = octal 061 Table 1.4 is a small slice from the full ASCII character set, just enough to give you a flavor of its organization. ASCII Character in Binary in Octal in Decimal in Hex space 00100000 040 32 20 ( 00101000 050 40 28 ) 00101001 051 41 29 * 00101010 052 42 2A 0 00110000 060 48 30 1 00110001 061 49 31 2 00110010 062 50 32 9 00111001 071 57 39 A 01000001 101 65 41 B 01000010 102 66 42 C 01000011 103 67 43 Z 01011010 132 90 5A a 01100001 141 97 61 b 01100010 142 98 62 c 01100011 143 99 63 z 01111010 172 122 7A Table 1.4 Here's a little trivia, from days long past when computers were so slow (compared with today).<query> what is the digit a in binary</query> Look closely at the binary representations of uppercase and lowercase letters. You can convert uppercase to lowercase by turning on a single bit. Or clearing the bit converts lowercase to uppercase. Clearing two bits will convert an ASCII digit to its numeric value. Setting the same bits converts a number in the range 0...9 into its ASCII character representation. Check Your Understanding So Far Take a moment to see if you understand the explanation of binary numbers. HERE is a jlogo program that converts an 8-bit byte into numbers and ASCII characters. Try it out! . Pixels The image on your computer's display consists of a bunch of colored points called pixels. A pixel is an object. It has a color and a position (its coordinates) which consists of the row and column it is at. Figure 1.1 shows an artist's rendition, a magnification of a display with a circle drawn in yellow.<query> convert numbers to ascii</query> The tiny black dots are the pixels and the big yellow dots are the pixels that have been colored. Figure 1.1 As an example, to display a thin vertical line, the color values of a column of pixels are set to the desired color of the line. If you want a thicker vertical line, you set the color values of the pixels of a group of consecutive columns to the desired color. Figure 1.2 shows a red line that's a single pixel wide and an orange line that's three pixels wide. The orange line is actually a very thin rectangle. Figure 1.2 So, the location of each pixel is obviously specified by a pair of numbers; what about the pixel's color? Well... a pixel's color is also specified as numbers, three of them, called RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. Play with the following Java applet which lets you see what number values generate which colors. What color do you get if you set red to 170, green to 85, and blue to 255? What's the RGB value for your favorite color?<query> what is the color of a pixel</query> alt=""Your browser understands the <APPLET> tag but isn't running the applet, for some reason."" Your browser is completely ignoring the <APPLET> tag! Color Numbers Applet So, just as groups of bits represent numbers and symbols, they are used to form pixels. Ok... I've exposed you to a variety of objects that you commonly see when you are using a computer, things that can be manipulated with instructions in a computer programming language. Now let's move on to the computer's instructions, one more thing that is just a bunch of bits! Programming Languages (The Microprocessor's Language) So, all a computer has in it is bits. You've seen how they are used to represent stuff, pixels, numbers and characters. I've mentioned that computers perform operations on the bits, like move them around, add pairs of them together, etc... One final obvious question is: how are instructions that a computer performs represented?<query> what is the computer program used for</query> Well, if you instructed a computer in its native language (machine language), you would have to write instructions in the form of (yes, once again) binary numbers. This is very, VERY hard to do. Although the pioneers of computer science did this, no one does this these days. Just to give you something to look at, just to compare, Table 1.5 shows what the assembler language program in Table 1.1 could look like assuming that the machine instructions are loaded into memory at addresses 100 through 107. Also, the group of numbers starts at memory address 111 and the size of the group is in memory address 110. Address OpCode Register Memory Address Index Register 100 205 1 400000 101 200 2 110 102 361 2 107 103 317 1 111 2 104 254 102 105 200 1 111 2 106 254 102 107 263 17 Address Value 110 67 111 47316 . . . 177 2751 Table 1.5 A detailed explanation of any computer's instruction set is beyond what can be presented here. I just wanted you to see how the symbolic information in assembler language programs needs to be converted to numbers (bits) before a computer can perform it. If you really want more details now, here is a side lesson from one of my favorite introductory computer science books: The Computer Continuum.<query> what is the memory address of assembler language</query> The lesson walks you through programming a very simple robot computer. And, I wrote a simulator for the Robot Computer in jLogo that you can play with HERE. Summary Computer programming is composing/authoring of a process/procedure for doing something, in great detail. proc-ess / Noun: A series of actions or steps taken to achieve an end. pro-ce-dure / Noun: A series of actions conducted in a certain order or manner. Since computers do not understand English and it would be impossible for a human to write a large program as a series of binary numbers that the computer can understand, we need something in between. High-level programming languages currently fit in this category. Given a programming language that you have chosen, you then follow its rules for composing statements (or expressions) that get the computer to do what you want.<query> what is computer programming</query> Because a computer is simply a very fast manipulator of bits (ones and zeros), through the the power of abstraction, computer scientists have layered levels of object representation and functionality, one on top of another. We have now been working on refining and extending these layers for over half of a century. Table 1.6 should give you a feel for where we stand with computer programming languages today. In the next lesson you'll start to write programs in Logo! Application-Specific Language(4GL) Examples: Mathematica, SQL High-Level Language Examples: Logo, Python Low-Level Language Example: C Assembler Language Example: Intel X86 Machine Language Example: Intel X86 Table 1.6 Exercise Cisco's Learning Network provides a game where you can test your ability to do binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions.<query> what language is logo</query> So, writing a computer program can be like composing music, like designing a house, like creating lots of stuff. It has been argued that in its current state it is anart, not engineering. An important reason to consider learning about how to program a computer is that the concepts underlying this will be valuable to you, regardless of whether or not you go on to make a career out of it. One thing that you will learn quickly is that a computer is very dumb but obedient. It does exactly what you tell it to do, which is not necessarily what you wanted. Programming will help you learn the importance of clarity of expression. A deep understanding of programming, in particular the notions of successive decomposition as a mode of analysis and debugging of trial solutions, results in significant educational benefits in many domains of discourse, including those unrelated to computers and information technology per se.<query> why do you need to learn to program a computer</query> Click here to go to the website to test your ability.

Muddled and half-baked ideas have sometimes survived for centuries because luminaries have deluded themselves as much as their followers or because lesser lights, fearing ridicule, couldn't summon up the nerve to admit that they didn't know what the Master was talking about. A test as near foolproof as one could get of whether you understand something as well as you think is to express it as a computer program and then see if the program does what it is supposed to.<query> how to understand something</query> Computers are not sycophants and won't make enthusiastic noises to ensure their promotion or camouflage what they don't know. What you get is what you said. (James P. Hogan in ""Mind Matters"") But, most of all, it can be lots of fun! An associate once said to me ""I can't believe I'm paid so well for something I love to do."" Just what do instructions a computer understands look like? And, what kinds of objects do the instructions manipulate? By the end of this lesson you will be able to answer these questions. But first let's try to write a program in the English language. Programming Using the English Language Remember what I said in the Introduction to this lesson? Writing software, computer programs, is a lot like writing down the steps it takes to do something.<query> what do computer instructions look like</query> Before we see what a computer programming language looks like, let's use the English language to describe how to do something as a series of steps. A common exercise that really gets you thinking about what computer programming can be like is to describe a process you are familiar with. Describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Rather than write my own version of this exercise, I searched the Internet for the words ""computer programming sandwich"" usingGoogle. One of the hits returned was http://teachers.net/lessons/posts/2166.html. At the link, Deb Sweeney (Tamaqua Area Middle School, Tamaqua, PA) described the problem as: Objective: Students will write specific and sequential steps on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Procedure: Students will write a very detailed and step-by-step paragraph on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for homework.<query> what is the computer programming language</query> The next day, the students will then input (read) their instructions to the computer (teacher). The teacher will then ""make"" the programs, being sure to do exactly what the students said... When this exercise is directed by an experienced teacher or mentor it is excellent for demonstrating how careful you need to be, how detailed you need to be, when writing a computer program. Here is teacher/mentor support material. Programming in a natural language, say the full scope of the English language, seems like a very difficult task. But, before moving on to languages we can write programs in today, I want to leave on a high note. Click here to read about how Stephen Wolfram sees programming in a natural language happening. Programming Languages (High-Level Languages) Almost all of the computer programming these days is done with high-level programming languages. There are lots of them and some are quite old. COBOL, FORTRAN, and Lisp were devised in the 1950s!!! As you will see, high-level languages make it easier to describe the pieces of the program you are creating. They help by letting you concentrate on what you are trying to do rather than that and how you fit it into a computer architecture. Theyabstract away the specifics of the microprocessor in your computer. And, all come with large sets of common stuff you need to do, called libraries.<query> what language do you use to write a program</query> In this introduction to programming, you will work with two computer languages: Logo and Java. Logo comes from Bolt, Beranek & Newman (BBN) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Seymour Papert, a scientist at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, championed this computer programming language in the 70s. More research of its use in educational settings exists than for any other programming language. In fact, the fairly newScratch Programming Language (also from MIT) consists of a modern graphical environment on top of Logo-like functionality. Java is a fairly recent programming language. It appeared in 1995 just as the Internet was starting to get lots of attention. Java was invented by James Gosling, working at Sun Microsystems. It's sort-of a medium-level language. One of the big advantages of learning Java is that there is a lot of software already written ( see: Java Class Library) which will help you write graphical programs that run on the Internet. You get to take advantage of software that thousands of programmers have already written. Java is used in a variety of applications, from mobile phones to massive Internet data manipulation. You get to work with window objects, Internet connection objects, database access objects and thousands of others. Java is the language used to write Android apps.<query> what is the difference between java and logo</query> So, why do these lessons start with the Logo programming language? I like the Logo language to teach introductory programming with because it is very easy to learn. The faster you get to write interesting computer programs the more fun you will have. And... having fun is important! But do not let Logo's simplicity fool you into thinking it is just a toy programming language. Logo is a derivative of the Lisp programming language, a very powerful language still used today to tackle some of the most advanced research being performed. Brian Harvey shows the power of Logo in hisComputer Science Logo Style series of books. Volume 3: Beyond Programming covers six college-level computer science topics with Logo. Both Logo and Java have the same sort of stuff needed to write computer programs. . They have the ability to manipulate objects including lots of arithmetic functions, you can compare objects and do different things depending on the outcome of the comparison, and they provide ways to control the order in which instructions get performed. And... that's what programming is really all about... as you will see.<query> what is logo programming language</query>"

At its core, computer science involves the rigorous study of processes. By a process, we mean a series of actions to achieve some desired result. This result may be as routine as keeping track of the running balance in a bank account or as spectacular as generating the 3D animations in the latest blockbuster movie. In particular, computer science involves the study of processes that can be carried out by the devices we call computers. Computers work by encoding processes internally. A process is thus relatively easy to change as the desired result evolves. The computer is an enabling technology of the modern world. It can be combined with preexisting technologies to enable some combination of increased functionality, decreased costs, and increased design flexibility.<query> what is computer science</query> The computer can enable new technologies that might not have been possible otherwise. Students in a computer science program learn how to define processes and encode them so that they can be carried out efficiently by computers. This involves such tasks as determining what result is needed (systems analysis), developing efficient and flexible software to encode the process (algorithm design, programming, and software engineering), and organizing the data needed and generated by the process (data structures and database management). Students in computer science also learn about the computers and the communication technologies and the control programs that make them work together. They learn how to use these technologies effectively to achieve the desired results.

Given the option, would you choose a gooey hot fudge sundae or a granola bar? A double cheeseburger or a double helping of green veggies? For many of us, eating healthy is harder than it sounds, especially when temptations abound. But thanks to the January 15, 2010 release of the Ministry of Education’s new School Food and Beverage Policy (PPM 150) making responsible food choices is about to get a lot easier for students across Ontario.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> Provincial funding operates within a broader scope of contributors to deliver the program, including parents or caregivers, corporate sponsors, farmers, local charities, community organizations and municipalities. The SNP Nutrition Guidelines follow Canada’s Food Guide and apply to foods served in programs. Guiding principals for the nutrition guidelines include: promote healthy eating, prepare healthy food, respect diversity and individual needs, contribute to social development, choose Ontario food first, be environmentally conscious and practice safe food handling and storage. To learn more about SNP or to download a copy of the SNP Nutrition Guidelines please visit the MCYS website at:www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/topics/schoolsnacks/index.aspx Another piece of the ‘Healthy School’ puzzle is falling into place...

And while the planning of new menus and food options is sure to be a big job, requiring the support of the entire school community, it is clearly a change that is worth making. Not only is the availability of healthy foods in schools bound to result in better eating habits and increased concentration levels for students but, perhaps most importantly, by reinforcing the knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding healthy living that are being taught through the revised Ontario Health and Physical Education Curriculum and encouraged by initiatives such as Foundations for a Healthy School, it is sure to send a strong message to students: Healthy eating habits are important... so important, in fact, that we are willing to work hard to ensure that our school environments support us all in making healthier choices.<query> why is healthy eating important in schools</query> View All Articles Post new comment Subject: Comment: * CAPTCHA This question is for testing whether you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions.

What this means is that choosing nutritious foods more often won’t only be encouraged, it will become an integral part of every school’s culture—something that we at Ophea could not be happier about. “Ophea shares the government’s commitment to healthy schools and healthy communities and believes that Ontario’s new School Food and Beverage Policy is a critical step that will reinforce the philosophy and expectations of the revised H&PE curriculum,” comments Chris Markham, Ophea’s executive director and CEO.<query> what is the new ontario food policy</query> “It will foster a healthier learning environment and help students reach their full potential.” Good nutrition leads to better health and better learning... It’s simple enough to do the math. With 195 days in a typical school year, Ontario students are eating most of their lunches at school. Whether these lunches are purchased in cafeterias or brought from home and supplemented with snacks from school vending machines, they often include high-fat, high-sugar, high-sodium, low nutrient foods such as fries, candy bars and sugary drinks. ""When our school board introduced nutrition standards in 2007, it was because we knew that a healthy diet would lead to more active and engaged students. The results have been outstanding,"" says Roger Lawler, Director of Education at the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. As the link between improved health and improved learning outcomes has been proven time and time again, and the connections between poor nutrition and chronic disease have been well documented, it’s become increasingly clear: poor nutrition is a problem that we, as a society, can no longer afford to ignore, and one that we all have a responsibility not to perpetuate.<query> why is nutrition important in school</query> Furthermore, the need to set a strong example for students by ‘practicing what we preach’ in schools cannot be understated. Through the implementation of Daily Physical Activity (DPA), the forging of community partnerships and the adoption of the Ministry of Education’s Foundations for a Healthy School framework, schools have already begun to take a more comprehensive approach to improving student health. But while positive health messages are taught and physical activity has been made a priority, the foods currently sold in schools often fail to support and reinforce what students are learning about healthy living. It’s time to make a change, and there’s never been a better time to get started! As schools begin to adopt the revised Health and Physical Education Curriculum (Grades 1-8)—which not only provides information about health education but also builds students’ capacity to make healthy choices—the new policy will help to ensure greater alignment between what students are being taught and the food choices that are available, helping them to apply what they’re learning while fostering healthy habits that can last a lifetime.<query> why is physical education important in schools</query> The policy applies to all foods sold in schools... The new policy applies to foods and beverages sold on school premises for school purposes including all venues, such as cafeterias, vending machines and tuck shops. It also applies to all programs (for example, catered lunch programs) and must be enforced at all events, including bake sales and sports competitions. Exceptions to the policy will include foods and beverages that are: offered in schools at no cost; brought from home or purchased off school premises; available for purchase during field trips off school premises; sold in schools for non-school purposes (e.g., sold by an outside organization using the school gym after school hours and for non school-related events); sold for fundraising activities that occur off school premises; and sold in staff rooms. Under the policy, school principals may also elect to designate up to 10 days (or fewer as determined by the school board) during the school year as “special-event days” on which foods and beverages that do not meet the nutrition standards may be sold.<query> what is the policy for food sold in schools</query> The healthiest foods have the highest nutritional values... The policy groups foods and beverages into three categories: “The Sell Most Category” must make up at least 80% of choices offered. These foods and beverages generally have higher levels of essential nutrients and lower levels of fat, sugar and/or sodium. Examples may include fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruits and vegetables; and whole grain breads. “The Sell Less Category” must make up no more than 20% of choices offered. These foods have slightly higher amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium than the ‘Sell Most Category.’ Examples may include deli meats, frozen pizza and hotdogs. Foods that are in the “Not Permitted for Sale Category” are generally those that contain few or no essential nutrients and high amounts of fat, sugar and/or sodium.<query> what is the sell most category for food</query> Examples include deep fried foods, energy bars and candy. More information about the criteria for determining a food’s suitability can be found inThe School Food & Beverage Policy itself. When it comes to implementation, help is readily available... Throughout the winter of 2010, school board teams and principals will receive training from the Ministry of Education in how to implement the new policy, and further information about implementation support can be found at www.ontario.ca/healthyschools. As with any new policy or initiative, getting started is the hardest part. School boards are encouraged to reach out to students, staff, parents, community partners and food service providers in order to gain their support. School boards should also seek support from their local board of health, as they have been mandated under the Ontario Public Health Standards, 2008 to work with school boards and/or staff in elementary, secondary and post-secondary educational settings, using a comprehensive health promotion approach.<query> what is the ontario school food policy</query> The goal of this collaboration is to influence the development and implementation of healthy policies, and the creation or enhancement of supportive environments to address healthy eating and other key health issues (including physical activity, alcohol use and tobacco control). For more information on working with your local board of health, see www.ophea.net/healthy-schools-communities/making-it-happen/step-3. Schools and communities can also access the following sources for further information and for support for healthy eating: Eat Right Ontario – This is an initiative of the Ministry of Health Promotion. Through this program, schools (or other interested parties) can access a registered dietician by phone or by email to answer any questions they have about healthy eating. Their website, www.eatrightontario.ca, also contains a wealth of information about diabetes prevention, menu planning, and health and nutrition, as well as a listing of healthy recipes.<query> what is the health promotion program for schools</query> Menu of Choices – This online resource, published by Ophea, provides the latest quality information and supports to help school communities understand, plan and address healthy eating. The website, www.menuofchoices.ca, which encourages entire school communities to take a proactive approach to addressing the eating behaviours of children and youth (Grades K-12), can be accessed by all educators and community partners who want to help students develop a personal commitment to healthy eating. Student Nutrition Program (SNP) – This Ministry of Children and Youth Services (MCYS) program supports communities to provide nutritious food to children and youth. The program supports the healthy growth and development of children and youth by providing universal access to nutritious meals and snacks at each site so students are ready to learn. SNP is a community-driven initiative. The service delivery model is designed to encourage and facilitate community participation in the development and implementation of the program at the local level so programs can be tailored to meet the individual needs of local children, youth and families.<query> what is snp</query>"

clueweb12-1615wb-10-13858,2,2,"Setting up a Notebook versus a Desktop Setting up a Notebook versus a Desktop Introduction This document is targeted at all recipients of Client Managed PCs here at the University of Waterloo. Since most of these are notebooks in Academic Support, the additional focus is specifically at portables. Desktop PC owners that manage their own PCs may also benefit. Desktop PCs in Academic Support are used differently than notebooks and because they rarely leave the users office they are almost all imaged and managed by IST. Definition of Terms The term “notebook” is used throughout this document to mean a combination of all laptops and tablets. A laptop is a portable PC. A tablet is a portable PC with a touch-sensitive screen. This screen allows for the use of a special pen, to act as a mouse or enter text or objects, as you might on a pad of paper.<query> what is the difference between a laptop and a desktop</query> As attractive as it may seem that you may be able to work away from the office with a notebook, the reality is you won’t be able to stay too far away from an external power supply for more than 4-5 hours. · Some notebooks include additional technologies, like Bluetooth, specialized memory or functional cards. None of these are covered in this document. · Power off, versus Standby versus Hibernation: Three modes are available due to the nature of notebooks. Power on/off is obvious. Standby is what your PC can be set to go into when you leave it unattended for some time (like a desktop). Hibernation is the state a notebook enters when you close the lid for portability. Standby is the same as hibernation except that data is still in memory during standby mode.<query> what is the difference between standby and hibernation</query> (In hibernation mode, data in memory is written to disk.) Both allow you to power back on again and continue right where you left off with all data retained. Specialized features of Some Notebooks · Beware of changing the operating system from the version your computer came with. 1. For instance the Toshiba Satellite and the Sony Vio come with authorization codes that enable theDVD/CD. When you upgrade from WXP Home Edition to WXP Professional theDVD will no longer work. The manufacturer will not supply a code citing they do not support those Models with any other version of the OS than the one supplied. 2. WXP Multimedia Edition is supplied on some and should not be replaced. Functionality will be lost if it is. 3. WXP Professional will run fine on a tablet. WXP Tablet Edition is however required for full functionality.<query> what is wxp professional</query> Tablet Edition Exceptions These steps are unique to tablet notebooks and the WXP Tablet Edition operating system and do not apply to a non-tablet notebooks. · One of the first steps requested of the user is configuration of the tablet so it can better understand their handwriting. Questions like “Are you right handed or left handed” have a significant impact on how the tablet interprets how it’s used when using electronic ink. · It is strongly encouraged that the first-time tablet user go through the pen-training exercise. We’ve all been using mice for long enough that using a pen in place of one is very intuitive. However, there are nuances the one must get used. to, like the fact that the pointer on the screen lags slightly behind the point of the pen being the biggest.<query> what is the first step to using a tablet</query> Most are quickly overcome. · Specialty software like Office 2003 has features geared to WXP Tablet Edition and the “electronic ink” feature of tablets. (Office XP does work.) Vendor-added Tools and Applications Here are some observations: · Like their desktop counterparts the OS comes installed by the vendor on a notebook. Unlike desktops, notebook OS’s are more customized to work in tandem with hardware features of the notebook. UW supplied OS images can be supplied but should be customized to include vendor added specialty tools. · Alternately, one could start with the vendor image and apply the changes requested by your departments as documented at: o Changes Applied to a Managed ADS Workstation and o IST Managed PC’s: Laptops and Tablets · WXP has notebook provisions within it.<query> what is wxp tablet edition</query> It is likely that every feature a vendor customizes their OS with, for their notebooks, is available in some form from Microsoft in the operating system. The equivalent vendor tool sometimes disables the one in WXP forcing you to use the vendor’s version, if installed. There are advantages to having all of Academic Support using OS tools the same way but on a notebook, the vendor supplied tools are usually superior. Usage Specifics Hardware Touch Pad A touch pad can be disabled if it’s not going to be used or its use becomes problematic. Check for a touchpad icon on the start menu, at the right, which allows you to turn it on and off. Otherwise this menu can be accessed from the Control Panel under “Mouse Properties”. Docking Station/Port Replicator A docking station makes for a nice alternative to plugging in any external devices, a network cable and the power supply into your notebook every time you arrive at your home base.<query> what is the use of the touch pad on a notebook</query> If your notebook manufacturer offers one of these as an option it will certainly extend the life of your cable connections and simplify their entry. These do not come without their problems however as we learned the hard way. Because manufacturers try and reduce costs they often share docking stations between notebook models. Ours did not make all ports on the docking station available however. The PS2 mouse and keyboard ports, although present, were not enabled opting instead for USB connections. This is fine if USB keyboards and mice are present but more money if they are not. Ours also did not enable the serial port for the same reason. Some devices like some models of Blackberries and Palms require a serial connection to synchronize with the notebook. Ergonomics Although the full discussion has been left up to other documents to elaborate on it bears mentioning that true ergonomic use of a notebook can be somewhat challenging compared to a desktop.<query> why do notebooks need a usb port</query> Unless you use an external keyboard, mouse and monitor it can be difficult to maintain a proper sitting stance while using a notebook. The keyboards are typically smaller. The touchpad is positioned in such a way that it sometimes gets accidentally depressed while typing, causing the curser position to change. The screens are small and too low on your desk for extended use. In addition, although some notebooks are referred to as “laptops” they get quite warm making use of them in your lap uncomfortable. Extending a tablet with an external monitor looses the “electronic ink” and pointing functions of the pen on the external monitor. Few of these things are obvious when first buying a notebook. For portability, of course, they are excellent, but even there the weight can become excessive by the time you carry a case, your power adapter, any external devices and perhaps an extra battery.<query> why is it uncomfortable to use a laptop</query> Consider your purchase of a notebook over a desktop carefully. Hardware Security It is highly recommended that your notebook be clearly marked on the outside with identification of the recipient and any other way that may be a deterrent to would-be thieves. If possible this identification should be etched in a way that can not be easily removed. The recipient’s name and contact information is important so a found unit can be quickly returned. Operating System Passwords On all computers it is of course prudent to set up all accounts to enter a password to gain access. This is configured automatically in our domain along with a second password that is required word when a computer is returned from standby mode (in case you leave your computer logged on for a while unattended). On a notebook both of these are even more critical as it makes the unit more attractive to steal if full access is automatically gained.<query> why is it important to have a notebook on a computer</query> What is different however on a notebook is that there is a third password that should be set. This is the hibernation password. (This is the password required when you close the lid on your notebook and open it again.) Although not having a hibernation password is definitely a convenience for you, it also allows someone to easily compromise not only your notebook but all your personal local and networked files! To set this option you may have to enter the manufacturers Power Management utility. On a Toshiba, for instance, there is one button there that sets a standby and a hibernation password together. The power-on password is set under Control Panel./User Accounts. The “standby” password is set under “Power Option Properties” under the “Advanced” tab. Check the box that says: “Prompt for password when computer resumes from standby”.<query> what is the password for hibernation</query> The last note on passwords is that you end up in many situations, usually in a browser, or when mapping a drive, that you get asked if you wish your computer to “remember your password”. Always say NO. It is not a good idea for your PC to bypass required authentication to resources important enough to require authentication. Administrative Versus Limited User Accounts When you first turn on a notebook or desktop PC running Windows XP, you are not required to log on at all. When you create a user account for security reasons, this account defaults to an administrative user. Again, if you follow our guidelines and create a second “limited user” account and try and use this for all day-to-day work a few differences will become apparent. Applications will typically work as expected.<query> what is the difference between an administrative and limited user account</query> Note: You are still wise to try and run this way in that the OS and installed applications are more protected from inadvertent mistakes but here is what you may miss. Below is a list of things you will need to have more than limited administrative access to, to accomplish: · Power Options: When notebook power is plugged into the wall power options can only be configured by an administrator. When the notebook is running off of battery this becomes a user profile feature that all can manage themselves. This includes all timing parameters for hibernation, standby and shutdown modes. NOTE: this is not the case if vendor tools are not installed and WXP is able to configure these settings. In this case these are user-profile settings. · Network settings: because notebooks tend to move the network settings may need to be changed if everything not available via DHCP.<query> what is the power option on a notebook</query> · Mail Server: You may not be able to change the mail server if you are not an administrator. Profiles If all you use is one account a profile is simply the way your desktop, your preferences and your customizations are stored. If you’ve followed the accepted practice of setting up a non-administrative account in addition to a local administrative one your notebook will have a different profile defined for each account. This has advantages and also disadvantages for you, the end user. (See the discussion of profiles below in the section called “Implications of joining ADS”. Something you should be aware of is that the contents of one profile, like the “My Documents” folder for instance, are not always readable by any other user of the notebook. For this reason a special folder called “Shared Documents” exists under C:\Documents and Settings\All Users.<query> what is profile in a notebook</query> Beware though that anything stored here will not only allow access to physical users of this notebook but also networked “virtual” users unless proper firewalls are in place. OS Security Actual operating system security discussion details is left up to many of the other documents and web pages IST, and others, maintain. For more information see the following reference: How to set up your PC to Academic Support Standards Suffice it to say that a properly managed notebook (or desktop) should always have Windows Firewall (previously called ICF) turned on and be kept up-to-date in terms of patches and antivirus software. Network A connection to the network is required for several reasons. The first is to keep offline copies of all of your documents. Even if you have all of the applications you need to work locally it is still a very good idea to keep the primary copy on a server where it is properly backed up.<query> why is it important to keep a notebook</query> The second is to access resources. Networked printers, departmental documents, access to the internet and email are just some of the many reasons to be connected. NOTE: Most of these resources will likely mean at least authenticating in a domain. Another reason is to keep your operating system and all of your applications current. Ironically patches are usually released, for security reasons, to protect computers from viruses and hackers when your computeris connected to a network, however, some are to fix problems reported within the OS and applications themselves. Most notebooks come with the following three ways to connect, depending on your circumstances: Wireless After turning on the wireless adapter the connection is made by: · Selecting the “Wireless Network Connection” Icon in the bottom right of your screen. (It looks like a monitor with waves coming out of it) · Select uw-wireless (at UW) · Check “Allow me to connect to the selected wireless network, even though it is not secure” · Launch Internet Explorer (or some other browser) · Connect to http://www.laptop.uwaterloo.ca/ and authenticate.<query> why connect to network</query> Wired At UW it is best to always explicitly set the network Speed and Duplex settings to what is configured at the other end (on the switch). Because this may change from other locations where the notebook is used you may wish to leave this at “Auto Detect” unless a problem is experienced. NOTE: We often don’t notice the problem until we monitor the connection, connect to a large number of printers or push a large application to a computer with it’s setting at “Auto Detect”. Everything seems to be fine but errors are generated on the switch. The connection will be fastest if you can explicitly configure this. Modem As the proliferation of high-speed becomes more affordable the need for modem connections diminish. Many notebooks do come with internal modems and configuration in the OS to make use of it is the same as with a desktop. Implications of Joining ADS To properly manage a PC ADS administrators prefer the computer be part of the ADS domain.<query> what is the setting for network speed</query> This has not happened as often as it could have because of concerns (on both sides) of what the implications of joining an unknown notebook to the domain might be. As a notebook user you may not wish to manage the OS or the applications and might feel you can benefit by having your notebook be managed. This section tries to identify the implications of joining the ADS domain. (Note: You do not have to be a member of any domain to have your notebook be managed. It does however offer both you and administrators more options by doing so.) To join any domain you have to have local administration capabilities. This is usually not a problem as most notebook users have a way to do this. You also have to have permissions within the domain to be allowed to join a computer to that domain.<query> what is the domain name for a notebook</query> This will need to be coordinated with someone with this privilege. Once you join any domain, the logon method changes. When you are stand-a-lone, with authentication required and more than one user defined, a Welcome screen with all local accounts show when you first power up. This changes to a message box containing a userid, a password and a domain field. From here you will be able to not only log into a domain account, but into a local account. Features you may have used before, like Fast User Switching (the ability to switch between users instead of logging off) go away. This unfortunately can not be altered. Offline Files, which were not possible with Fast User Switching enabled can now be taken advantage of while in the domain. Offline file Synchronization is typically turned on by default when you load Windows XP.<query> how to log into a domain account</query> (See note above.) What this means is the first time you log into your ADS account, if you have a home folder (an N: drive) defined, is you will automatically have all files in the home folder synchronized with a local copy on the notebook. Since there is no local copy, all files will be copied into an “Offline Files” folder. This means the next time you log onto this notebook and arenot connected to the UW network you will still be able to see, update and delete anything in this (previously) networked folder. You can also create new files in this folder. The next time you connect back into the UW network the changes will be synchronized back to the real networked drive! NOTE: File synchronization means nothing to a desktop computer that is always connected to the network so this feature is turned off for all computers in the Academic Support OU.NOTE: Unless synchronization features have been altered this file synchronization doesnot take place when a notebook goes into hibernation mode.<query> what is the synchronization folder on uw notebook</query> You need to log on or off, or manually synchronize, to get updated files. As implied above and as recommended for reasons cited below, once you have your notebook joined to ADS you will be able to log in to your notebook with your ADS user account. Even if your notebook is not connected to the UW network (wireless or wired) you will still be able to log into your notebook with this same ADS account using cached credentials WXP stores locally for you. It is strongly encouraged that you get used to always using this account and do not make it a local administrative account. (It is not by default.) User Profiles can be a challenge to maintain. As soon as you switch from your local account to the domain one you get a new profile. For this reason it is wise to join your departmental domain (ADS) with your notebook as soon as possible.<query> can i log into my notebook with my ads account</query> When you disconnect from the domain (by leaving the campus or disconnecting from the network in any way) you will still be able to log in with cached credentials with your domain account. If you connect your notebook elsewhere using another network provider you may or may not be able to get at your ADS resources. We block key Windows protocols for some services. When connecting wireless the initial connection to ADS can be a problimatic. To be allowed to join our domain you need to be on the network and on as local administrator. To log into ADS the first time you need to log out (as administrator) and log on with your ADS credentials. When you log out, if you wait too long, you may have your wireless connection dropped. If you are note on the network, you can not get authenticated.<query> how to log into ads wireless</query> Much more time was spent applying these modifications, first to individual’s PC’s, than entire departments and finally to the image distributed to Academic Support desktops. We now believe we have a secure, functional and very usable image that allows our clients to be more efficient. To see what changes have been applied go to:Local Changes applied to an ADS Workstation . For details on exactly how to apply these changes yourself, go to: How to configure your PC to Academic Support Standards . In many ways, with notebooks, we’re back at square one. The OS is typically as installed by the vendor, and the applications, if present, may not be configured as preferred or required by your departments. This not only puts IT staff at a disadvantage in terms of support but also you, the client, in terms of consistency with other PC’s you may use at UW.<query> what is the os of a notebook</query> To be on the network via wireless you need to go through an NAA (Network Authentication Appliance). The procedure we recommend is: authenticate to the NAA so you are connected, join the ADS domain (as administrator as outlined above), log out and log in again with your ADS credentials (and here is the key) *before* the NAA times out and disconnects your notebook from the network. This will create the new ADS profile on your computer and allow you to connect. NOTE: This is not a problem after the first time. Why can’t Notebooks be Managed the Same Roaming Profiles Roaming profiles transfer easily and without incident between workstations with similar builds. If you notebook is not configured similarly to your desktop some elements of your profile may not work as expected. Problems may also appear between dissimilar versions of Windows XP.<query> why can't notebooks be managed the same</query> These will be even more pronounced if one is running Windows 2000. Unfortunately, there are several parts of a profile that benefit the user greatly if transferred since it can be time consuming to manage two profiles. Things as simple as icon placement and desktop backgrounds are a luxury, but a nuisance if they need to be done twice. Things like browser favourites, application configurations, dictionary customizations, mail servers etc. are more than a convenience and take time to apply twice. Proceed cautiously if using both a desktop and a notebook in our managed environment and desiring a roaming profile. Our normal recommendation is to turn it off in this case. File Synchronization (also called “Offline Files”) As described in the “Implications of Joining ADS” section there are advantages to having file synchronization turned on with a notebook.<query> why do i need to transfer two profiles</query> On a desktop it can actually unnecessarily slow things down at times as there is little-if-any benefit of maintaining a local copy of networked files on a computer that is rarely disconnected from the network. Therefore our recommendations for each are different. You probably want this feature enabled on your notebook but have it prompt you before actually doing the synchronization. If you don’t you may find it trying to synchronizing to some other server while traveling and deleting your documents!! Power Saver Modes Utilities shipped with the notebook sometimes conflict with the ones supplied within Windows XP. In the case of power saver mode it will let you try and configure personal preferences in the operating system but then when you go to save them, it will refer you to the ones supplied by the manufacturer. This means we can not configure them centrally, even if we could come up with a consensus matching most peoples working habits.<query> why do notebooks need power saver mode</query> Other Updates are pushed to a desktop and the desktop is then scheduled to be rebooted in the very early hours of the morning (sometimes more than once). Like a home computer we don’t know the notebook will be on, or reachable. The solution is to properly educate the notebook user in how to best manage this themselves.

Source: esha Research, Food Processor for Windows, Version 7.8M Whole Grains and Fish Highly Protective against Childhood Asthma<query> how much fiber in a cup of oatmeal</query> While no association between asthma and intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products was found (a result at odds with other studies that have supported a link between antioxidant intake, particularly vitamins C and E, and asthma), the children's intake of both whole grains and fish was significantly linked to incidence of wheezing and current asthma. In children with a low intake of fish and whole grains, the prevalence of wheezing was almost 20%, but was only 4.2% in children with a high intake of both foods. Low intake of fish and whole grains also correlated with a much higher incidence of current asthma (16.7%). compared to only a 2.8% incidence of current asthma among children with a high intake of both foods. After adjusting results for possible confounding factors, such as the educational level of the mother, and total energy intake, high intakes of whole grains and fish were found to be associated with a 54 and 66% reduction in the probability of being asthmatic, respectively.<query> foods that help asthma</query> The probability of having asthma with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), defined as having an increased sensitivity to factors that cause narrowing of the airways, was reduced by 72 and 88% when children had a high-intake of whole grains and fish, respectively. Lead researcher, CoraTabak commented, ""The rise in the prevalence of asthma in western societies may be related to changed dietary habits."" We agree. The Standard American Diet is sorely deficient in the numerous anti-inflammatory compounds found in fish and whole grains, notably, the omega-3 fats supplied by cold water fish and the magnesium and vitamin E provided by whole grains. One caution: wheat may need to be avoided as it is a common food allergen associated with asthma. Gallstone Prevention Eating foods high in insoluble fiber, such as quinoa, can help women avoid gallstones, shows a study published in theAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology.<query> foods that help asthma</query> Studying the overall fiber intake and types of fiber consumed over a 16 year period by over 69,000 women in the Nurses Health Study, researchers found that those consuming the most fiber overall (both soluble and insoluble) had a 13% lower risk of developing gallstones compared to women consuming the fewest fiber-rich foods. Those eating the most foods rich in insoluble fiber gained even more protection against gallstones: a 17% lower risk compared to women eating the least. And the protection was dose-related; a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake dropped risk dropped 10%. How do foods rich in insoluble fiber help prevent gallstones? Researchers think insoluble fiber not only speeds intestinal transit time (how quickly food moves through the intestines), but reduces the secretion of bile acids (excessive amounts contribute to gallstone formation), increases insulin sensitivity and lowers triglycerides (blood fats).<query> what fiber is good for gallstones</query> Abundant in all whole grains, insoluble fiber is also found in nuts and the edible skin of fruits and vegetables including tomatoes, cucumbers, many squash, apples, berries, and pears. In addition, beans provide insoluble as well as soluble fiber. Health-Promoting Activity Equal to or Even Higher than that of Vegetables and Fruits Research reported at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) International Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer, by Rui Hai Liu, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at Cornell University shows that whole grains, such as quinoa, contain many powerful phytonutrients whose activity has gone unrecognized because research methods have overlooked them. Despite the fact that for years researchers have been measuring the antioxidant power of a wide array of phytonutrients, they have typically measured only the ""free"" forms of these substances, which dissolve quickly and are immediately absorbed into the bloodstream.<query> what foods contain insoluble fiber</query> They have not looked at the ""bound"" forms, which are attached to the walls of plant cells and must be released by intestinal bacteria during digestion before they can be absorbed. Phenolics, powerful antioxidants that work in multiple ways to prevent disease, are one major class of phytonutrients that have been widely studied. Included in this broad category are such compounds as quercetin, curcumin, ellagic acid, catechins, and many others that appear frequently in the health news. When Dr. Liu and his colleagues measured the relative amounts of phenolics, and whether they were present in bound or free form, in common fruits and vegetables like apples, red grapes, broccoli and spinach, they found that phenolics in the ""free"" form averaged 76% of the total number of phenolics in these foods.

Tips for Preparing and Cooking Tips for Preparing Quinoa While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands. To ensure that the saponins have been completely removed, taste a few seeds. If they still have a bitter taste, continue the rinsing process.<query> how long can you keep quinoa in the refrigerator</query> This chart graphically details the %DV that a serving of Quinoa provides for each of the nutrients of which it is a good, very good, or excellent source according to our Food Rating System.

In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients. Because quinoa is a very good source of manganese as well as a good source of magnesium, folate, and phosphorus, this ""grain"" may be especially valuable for persons with migraine headaches, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Help for Migraine Headaches If you are prone to migraines, try adding quinoa to your diet. Quinoa is a good source ofmagnesium, a mineral that helps relax blood vessels, preventing the constriction and rebound dilation characteristic of migraines. Increased intake of magnesium has been shown to be related to a reduced frequency of headache episodes reported by migraine sufferers.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Quinoa is also a good source ofriboflavin, which is necessary for proper energy production within cells. Riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) has been shown to help reduce the frequency of attacks in migraine sufferers, most likely by improving the energy metabolism within their brain and muscle cells. Cardiovascular Health Quinoa is a very good source of magnesium, the mineral that relaxes blood vessels. Since low dietary levels of magnesium are associated with increased rates of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart arrhythmias, this ancient grain can offer yet another way to provide cardiovascular health for those concerned about atherosclerosis. Prevent Heart Failure with a Whole Grains Breakfast Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among the elderly in the United States. Success of drug treatment is only partial (ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are typically used; no evidence has found statins safe or effective for heart failure), and its prognosis remains poor.<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Follow up of 2445 discharged hospital patients with heart failure revealed that 37.3% died during the first year, and 78.5% died within 5 years. Arch Intern Med. 2007 Mar 12;167(5):490-6.; Eur Heart J. 2006 Mar;27(6):641-3. Since consumption of whole grain products and dietary fiber has been shown to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack, Harvard researchers decided to look at the effects of cereal consumption on heart failure risk and followed 21,376 participants in the Physicians Health Study over a period of 19.6 years. After adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol consumption, vegetable consumption, use of vitamins, exercise, and history of heart disease), they found that men who simply enjoyed a daily morning bowl of whole grain (but not refined) cereal had a 29% lower risk of heart failure.<query> what is the benefit of cereal</query> Arch Intern Med. 2007 Oct 22;167(19):2080-5.

Significant Cardiovascular Benefits for Postmenopausal Women Eating a serving of whole grains, such as quinoa, at least 6 times each week is an especially good idea for postmenopausal women with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or other signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 3-year prospective study of over 200 postmenopausal women with CVD, published in the July 2005 issue of theAmerican Heart Journal, shows that those eating at least 6 servings of whole grains each week experienced both: Slowed progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows, and Less progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.<query> benefits of eating whole grains</query> The women's intake of fiber from fruits, vegetables and refined grains wasnot associated with a lessening in CVD progression. Antioxidant Protection Quinoa is a very good source of manganese, a mineral that serve as a cofactor for the superoxide dismutase enzyme. Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant that helps to protect the mitochondria from oxidative damage created during energy production as well as guard other cells, such as red blood cells, from injury caused by free radicals. Fiber from Whole Grains and Fruit Protective against Breast Cancer When researchers looked at how much fiber 35,972 participants in the UK Women's Cohort Study ate, they found a diet rich in fiber from whole grains, such as quinoa, and fruit offered significant protection against breast cancer for pre-menopausal women. (Cade JE, Burley VJ, et al. ,International Journal of Epidemiology).<query> what is quinoa good for</query> Pre-menopausal women eating the most fiber (>30 grams daily) more than halved their risk of developing breast cancer, enjoying a 52% lower risk of breast cancer compared to women whose diets supplied the least fiber (<20 grams/day). Fiber supplied by whole grains offered the most protection. Pre-menopausal women eating the most whole grain fiber (at least 13 g/day) had a 41% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest whole grain fiber intake (4 g or less per day). Fiber from fruit was also protective. Pre-menopausal women whose diets supplied the most fiber from fruit (at least 6 g/day) had a 29% reduced risk of breast cancer, compared to those with the lowest fruit fiber intake (2 g or less per day).<query> what is the best fiber for premenopausal women</query>"

Is this the only option worth considering? I work as a sales representative for one of the large PC manufacturers, at many different technology retail stores. Three years ago, I heard about Open Source and Linux. My first exposure came in the form of the Firefox browser. When I speak with customers, I talk about my experiences using Linux. I ask them if their computer is running slow, and the answer is always ""Yes"". They tell me how it is running really slow no matter what they do, or how they can't seem to create any free room on their hard drive.<query> what is linux given away</query> If I do it right, they do not even feel their own shift in opinion or preference.

I tell them how it can read and save the MS formats, and how I have been using it at college even though MS-Office dominates on campus. I tell them what it can do and that it doesn't cost a dime. That usually gets their attention. I also will often hear the customer say, ""As soon as I get home I am going to throw the old computer away"". What I say at that point - and what I think we should all be saying - is ""You know that old computer that can't run Windows the way you need it to anymore? Give it to me, and I'll fix it up and give it to someone or some family that does not have a computer."" I have had several conversations with customers that have led to them giving me their old computers when buying a new one.<query> what is the name of the program that reads ms files</query> I fixed one up and gave it to a friend of mine who lives on a ranch in Colorado, and because of it he has been able to stay in contact with friends and family here in Phoenix.

Think about it. We would not only double the number of people who use Linux, but have a very positive effect on society. We all know that having a computer in the home makes everyone who uses it read better. It is my belief that that the ability to read well does as much or more for that person as going to school.

As the saying goes, ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression"". I hope that what I say in this article will help you make that first impression a good one. Over the last two years, I have gone from not knowing how to pronounce ""Linux"" correctly to... well, still not knowing how to pronounce SuSE correctly. You gotta admit, though - fixing up and giving away computers is at least good karma (I hope).<query> how to pronounce sue correctly</query> Part 2 - Changing Opinions If someone has already made up their mind not to give something new a try, then there is no sense in wasting your time trying make them re-think their decision. However, there are plenty of other people around - and some of them are only held back by excuses. Among those who give such excuses, there are those who are just repeating what they have heard or read and really do not have any of their own information or experience to draw from. They are easy to pick out - once you have heard hundreds of different people say almost the exact same thing like I have. It's not that hard; all you have to do is ask a few questions and you can easily determine if they are just repeating what they have heard or actually have their own reasons for not wanting to give Linux a try.<query> why do people say they won't give linux a try</query> Here is what I do: Ask them if they use IE, WMP (Windows Media Player), Quicktime, iTunes, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access... and always ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they are using. Make sure that you always end with the Anti-Viruses - trust me, I'll tell you why in a moment. You will find that roughly 99% of the people you talk to do not even use all of those programs I listed - and very, very few use any programs that are not on that list. Most people only use IE, Word, WMP, and maybe Quicktime a little - and whatever Anti-Virus software they have installed. Ask them how many types of Anti-Virus programs they use. After you ask, most people will repeat it back to you saying, ""How many types of Anti-Virus programs do I use?"" ""Do you have more than one Anti-Virus program on your computer?"" Some people do not - but many do use more than one.<query> what programs do people use on computers</query> This is where I tell them, ""When I ran Windows, I used Ad-Aware, Zone Alarm, AVG, McAfee (the free version), Spybot, Spywareblaster, Spyware-Doctor, Webroot, and Registry Mechanic."" Which is true: I had all of them on my computer at the same time and between them I could keep my system fairly safe. Fairly. Ask them if they have ever heard of Firefox. Some will ask, ""What is Firefox?"" - ""Firefox is a browser."" ""What is a browser?"" - ""It is a program that you use to surf the Internet."" ""You mean like IE?"" - ""Exactly, only it is a lot safer than IE."" This is where I go into the features, how it imports favorites and why it is safer than IE.<query> what is the difference between ie and firefox</query> Something like: ""Because it is not a part of the operating system, it is a lot harder for spyware to damage your system when using Firefox."" Again, technically true. Ask them if they have ever heard of OpenOffice.org. Then say to them, ""OpenOffice allows you to view, modify, save, and send the changed document in MS format and it does not cost $500... actually, it does not cost a dime."" I will tell you that a lot of people are not happy when they buy a new computer and then are told by the store employee that it does not come with Word or Office - and that if they want it, it will cost hundreds of dollars.

I am wondering what points I can use, specifically, as arguments to make a case for FOSS, specifically Linux, in a business setting. If I were hired as the IT director of a small company, and was asked to build an IT infrastructure, my inclination would be to begin building with Linux and FOSS, but when my boss came to me and asked me why I chose those technologies, honestly I would have very few concrete reasons. Here is what I have so far: I agree with the philosophy behind FOSS There are a plethora of plugins developed to help extend our infrastructure for our current (and future) needs If we find that a piece of software we downloaded (or purchased) is broken, or doesn't do what we need it to do, we have the source code and (hopefully) the resources to fix/change it.<query> why use linux and linux</query> Not only are there several (competing) options for paid support, there are a ton of free message boards, mailing lists and IRC chanels to get assistance from, making our virtual knowledge bank HUGE Total cost of ownership is going to be a fraction of that of closed source products. When needed, we can find closed source software to do what we need when we can't find a FOSS solution. That's where I am at. I am a programmer and know only the basics of networking, so the networking possibilities within FOSS elude me.

clueweb12-1907wb-30-04140,9,2,"Ubuntu FAQ - Is Ubuntu Linux more stable/secure than Windows? davestechsupport.com ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" HOME:: Ubuntu Linux - Frequently Asked Questions IS UBUNTU LINUX MORE STABLE/SECURE THAN WINDOWS? Above: A Windows Vista machine with anew and improved Blue Screen of Death. There is a saying out there that goes something like: ""The primary reason Microsoft Windows suffers so much from the threat of viruses and hackers is because it is the most widely used operating system."" This is partially correct, but this explanation doesn't lend any credence to the bigger picture. Microsoft Windows is, in terms of programming and architecture, asloppy and inefficient design. Evidence of this has been visited on nearly every Windows user at least once in their life, and perhaps multiple times (see photo).<query> is ubuntu secure</query> But Microsoft, with its millions of dollars spent on marketing, jokingly ""explained"" to people that this kind of experience was to be expected and accepted. That it is the very nature of the PC to crash unexpectedly on occasion. After all, human error does play a primary role in the deployment of software that is flawed by design, and that we should cut Microsoft a little slack. I think Microsoft should cut its own users some slack. Have you seen the price tags for Windows Vista? But I digress. One of the biggest flaws about Microsoft Windows is that it is proprietary software. At first glance, this might seem like good thing. The source code is kept secret so that programmers are unable to see just exactly how the operating system works. It is thought that this measure helps to prevent black-hat hackers from gaining access to the computer via an unpublished or unknown vulnerability, otherwise known as azero day exploit.<query> why is windows proprietary</query> It is also thought that keeping the source code proprietary will make it more difficult for a malicious programmer to write an effective virus aimed at causing harm to the system. But simply looking at the vast number of computer viruses that have been written specifically for the Windows platform (it's in the tens of thousands) just goes to show that it doesn't matter if your source code is secret or not. System vulnerabilities will continue to be discovered regardless. So how does Linux handle the threat of viruses? If the source code is public domain knowledge, wouldn't a hacker more easily be able to develop a virus that is targeted against Linux? In theory, a hacker could do that. But he'll have long series of mountains to climb before he can pull it off. The first mountain he'll have to climb is the source code itself, looking for flaws and vulnerabilities.<query> why is linux a good platform for viruses</query> But due to the open-source nature of Linux the source-code has already been proof-read by thousands and thousands of computer programmers who comb through, constantly looking for areas to make improvements to the software and identify potential problems or flaws. Linus' Law (named after Linus Torvalds) states, ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" Or more formally: ""Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone."" So the robustness of the source code comes from a compounded and continuous method of refining done by millions around the world, which makes Linux much more difficult to hack. A lonely group of hackers attempt to sneak a trojan bunny (containing malicious source code) into the castle Ubuntu Linux.<query> why is linux open source</query> It will backfire on them. The next mountain he could climb is to try and rewrite some source code and sneak a flaw into the official distribution. In order for anything to be included as a part of the official distribution it has to go through very extensive testing that is much more rigorous than the beta testing that Windows goes through. This isbecause the software is open source and accessable to many more testers; literally thousands more people are able to examine the software with their own fine tooth comb and then report their findings to the group. But the biggest mountain our poor hacker would have to climb is system administration privileges (also called root level access orSuperuser authentication). What this means is, if anybody wants to install a program (such as a virus), modify system critical configurations or settings, or do anything at all that may affect the way the OS runs, a password is required.<query> what is the biggest mountain a hacker could climb</query> By default in Windows, all users are given administrator privileges and no password is required to log into the computer or modify system configuration. You could even open the Windows folder and start deleting random files and the operating system would allow it to happen with barely a peep. This is bad design and bad security, which happen to be two flaws you will never ever find on a Linux system. It's simply not built that way. So that covers security in a nutshell, but what about stability? Well, for the same reasons Linux is more secure than Windows, Linux also stands to be more stable as well. This again is all thanks to the open source nature of the operating system. Programmers are only human and they are prone to make mistakes. This is what causes computers to crash or freeze.<query> why is linux more secure than windows</query> In the world of Windows, when a program locks up or a bug is found, it can sometimes be up in the air as to whether or not the problem will be solved. Security and stability on both operating systems are dealt with on a first come first serve basis. The big difference is that the number of people ready to analyze a problem on a Linux based system is much greater. Microsoft has a small team of highly paid programmers who can only handle so much. Linux has a massive team of freelance programmers who enjoy working in groups to resolve issues and then spread the word about a bug fix which leads to more granular refinement of the OS, resulting in a more robust OS in the long run.

Why use Linux? Related articles: What is Linux? Most people reading this article will probably be using Windows 95/8/NT. If you are such a reader and just use your computer for basic wordprocessing and spreadsheets I would recommend that you stick with Windows; for all its faults Windows is easy to use, fairly quick to learn and has some great software. For everyone else, please read on. Here are 10 reasons why Linux could be the best operating system for you: A Linux Distribution has thousands of dollars worth of software for no cost (or a couple of dollars if purchased on CD) Linux is a complete operating system that is: stable - the crash of an application is much less likely to bring down the operating system under Linux reliable - Linux servers are often up for hundreds of days compared with the regular reboots required with a Windows system extremely powerful Comes with a complete development environment, including C, C++, Fortran compilers, toolkits such as Qt and scripting languages such as Perl, Awk and sed.<query> why use linux</query> An excellent window system called X; the equivalent of Windows but much more flexible. Of course there are many other reasons to use Linux such as the full source code is provided and can be modified but 'regular' application users will unlikely need the source code. It is possible to set up your system to have more than one operating system on your computer. If you are contemplating using Linux this can be very handy; it lets you still keep Windows 95/NT (e.g. if work commitments require that you use certain software) and use Linux. This will require creating partitions on your Hard Disk. Documentation that accompanies most Linux distributions will explain how to create a 'multi-boot' system.

Tom Schreck Page 1 of 4 Tweet Dreaming of adding a dog to your happy, contented cat household? Worried the fur may fly? You can maintain harmony in your newly expanded pet household as long as you're willing to be patient, responsible and caring. First, recognize cats and dogs are two different species and they view the world differently, especially in your home. ""Cats are territorial. When you go on vacation, they're just happy to get a post card,"" saysPam Johnson-Bennett, animal behaviorist and author in Nashville, Tenn. ""Dogs are a different story. They want to go with you on vacation. As long as they are with you, they are happy."" Hierarchy Versus Territory Johnson-Bennett's tongue-in-cheek comment actually highlights the essential difference in what makes dogs and cats tick.<query> what is the difference between a cat and a dog</query> Dogs, being pack animals, look to a leader for guidance, direction and approval. They gladly follow the leader and contentedly accept their place in the household hierarchy. Cats, on the other hand, are more turf-oriented. And, while they certainly bond with their human companions, cats tend to feel more anxious or defensive than dogs when their territory namely, your house gets disturbed or threatened by change or a newcomer. For the unsuspecting new dog entering your home, this can mean trouble. That's why it is important to understand how dogs and cats socialize before making the introductions, saysLarry Lachman, Psy.D. and animal behavior consultant in Carmel, Calif. In his new book,Cats on the Counter , Lachman addresses the topic of bringing a new dog into a cat household. ""A well meaning, fun-loving dog may chase a cat thinking it's a playmate.<query> what is the difference between a cat and a dog</query> Dogs chase as part of their play,"" Lachman says. ""For the cat, that may mean its territory has been violated and it may defend that territory. This can be very traumatic for the cat. If either animal has not had a previous positive history with the other, then the introduction can be very difficult.""

By Mike Banahan and Dave Fisher, 16th September, 1999. Minor amendments 20th September 1999. Ever since Linux started to make some ground against Microsoft, no matter how small, various attempts have been made to guess and second-guess what response the Beast of Redmond is likely to take. A lot of the analysis is written by Linux ""true believers"" and has been clouded by wishful thinking or a lack of experience of working in large organisations. We've tried to look outside that particular box.<query> what is microsoft response to linux</query> In business as in comedy, timing is everything. Once the bitter pill needs to be swallowed, we don't think they will have any compunction.<query> what is the difference between comedy and business</query> Anyone who has worked on a late prestige project will know the poisonous atmosphere and upper-management suck-in that it creates. Our reading is that senior management in Microsoft simply hasn't had the the time to think strategies out and set a serious response policy yet. In frantic meetings, Linux will have been way down the agenda and given only limited amounts of thought. The easy and obvious tactics will be deployed: anything to stall and buy time will sound appealing. Hard-headed analysis by the deep thinkers will have to wait, they are too busy withreally important stuff. Anyone with the intellectual horsepower to think things through will have much more important things to occupy their minds at the moment. We think that what Microsoft has done so far is a first-rate example of a typical quick-fix: try some FUD, dismiss the ""problem"" in disparaging terms, try not to let it gain credence in the minds of the captive customers and hope and pray that it will just go away.<query> what is the microsoft response policy</query> The latter — hope it goes away - is usually a good tactic. Seasoned managers the world over know that this works well about ninety percent of the time. It's commonplace for this month's panic to evaporate of its own accord a few weeks later. A policy of relative inaction is often a good one. Microsoft's difficulty is that Linux is far from going away, but gaining visibility by the day. Linux is by no means their only problem either; their attempts at domination of the handheld and PDA markets are struggling, the mobile phone manufacturers are proving very awkward, sales of desktop systems (and hence software) are flat, NT penetration has levelled off and the press seem to sense a wounded giant. The news is not good. The company is seen by some to be structurally unstable.<query> what is microsoft's problem with linux</query>"

It's really about IIS vs. Apache (and/or NGINX, etc) more than the OS though. If you can use .htaccess in your hosted accounts you're using apache or something that is emulating it.

Its cheaper. Also, most open source applications such as wordpress are php which implies Linux / Apache. Probably the most compelling reasons for windows is if there is an application you want to use that is windows based or you have a programmer that knows windows. Or if you were unlucky enough to inherit a windows web site. There have been tons of posts on this on the web. The ""real"" programmers seem to concur that you can do the same things in either system. Its just a matter of practicality. Its cheaper and you have more resources for programming and development with Linux.

If you use things like .asp, ,.net, mssql, and other Microsoft technologies then you'll probably find a Windows server easier and better to use. If you tend toward the .php, mysql, open source side of things then Linux is probably the better way to go. I've had to work with Windows servers here and there using php and mysql and while the Windows server could run the site it made some things more difficult, particularly redirection as there's no .htaccess file. You could still set up redirection, but it was more difficult and wasn't capable of the same things .htaccess was. Given the technologies you work with I would think you'd want Linux every time.

Published On :26 July,2010 If you will talk about developing a website with anyone, apart from gathering information about the type of website you need, an important (mandatory) question will come – “do you have any preference for the technology to be used for deploying this website?” Most of the time answer is a question back “What do you suggest?”, reason being clients are not tech savvy so they really do not understand this question.<query> what platform is linux</query> And it’s logical too, if I am associated with implementing the technology I can better understand this question and directly say .NET or PHP as the answer, but if I am a cloth merchant looking for a website this question will sound like Greek to me. Now here the service provider takes the advantage that they suggest the technology in which they expertise, rather it should be decided depending upon the nature of the application to be deployed, scope of the future enhancements and to an extent the budget the client has allotted for the same. While talking about deploying web based applications Linux and Windows are the most popular platforms. Now depending upon the platform of the server on which the site is to be hosted defines the options of the scripting languages and the database servers that can be used for developing the application. If we talk about Linux as the platform the most commonly used scripting languages includes – PHP, CGI, Perl, Python etc.<query> what is the most popular scripting language</query> For Windows platform the scripting languages used are ASP, ASP.NET, C#, Cold Fusion etc. For the database servers Linux offers support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase etc and MS SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle are the database servers of choice for Windows platform. Its not mandatory that these are the categorizations for the scripting languages and database servers for the said platforms, the scripting languages for Linux also come for as Windows binary and visa versa. Though there are certain differences among these two as listed below, but both of them are platforms of choice for deploying functionality rich web based applications: - - Linux is an open source freeware whereas Windows is a Microsoft brand. - Additional components for Linux are generally free whereas the components for Windows need to be purchased. - Linux is considered to be more virus proof then Windows - Web space for Linux being freeware is less costly then Windows - The cost of Linux web space includes the cost for database server whereas for windows if MS SQL server is opted it costs additional.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux</query> For the purposes of listing factors to choose which platform, we can say: - - The budget the client has for hosting. - If the specific requirement requires a specific component then identifying weather it is available with Windows or Linux - If the size of database is going to be huge MS SQL sever is preferred because of the additional features it offers for the data management. - Both Linux and Windows are equally reliable and robust, but yes on Windows special software are required for providing safety from hackers and non-authentic access. - Is the client specific about brand then Windows is the only choice. Thus to conclude, both these platform are platforms of choice for deploying feature rich websites and offer flexibilities of deploying interactive and data rich websites.

Hosting Blog Hosting Articles Hosting Guide Tutorials Sunday March 11, 2012 Top Web Hosting Shared Web Hosting VPS Hosting Dedicated Hosting Reseller Hosting Windows or Linux web hosting platform? When it comes to choosing a platform or operating system, the choice that most people will face is between Linux/UNIX and Windows. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, its followers and its detractors. In this article, we'll list some of the main benefits of each platform, to help you make the choice that's right for you. Tips on how to choose between windows and linux hosting 1. Linux has a reputation for being more reliable than Windows. However, the new generation of Windows platforms (NT4.0 onwards) are generally considered to be nearly as reliable as UNIX. Reliability is probably only an issue if you're a developer. For the average user, there's nothing to choose between the two systems.<query> what is the difference between windows and linux hosting</query> 2. Similarly, there is nothing to choose between Windows and Linux when it comes to performance. Both perform hosting and operating functions to the same standard. 3. Professional web developers tend to prefer UNIX in terms of accessibility. Again, for the average user, both systems are equally user friendly, with simple to use control panels and interfaces. 4. UNIX is open source, and therefore more flexible than Windows, which is a commercial, proprietary product. UNIX can work across any number of operating systems, whereas Windows is pretty much confined to its own products. 5. UNIX also has a reputation for greater stability than Windows. This might be a decisive factor if you're a professional developer, or if your work requires a stable environment generally. 6. Linux is the gamer's platform of choice, since it allows the game to run smoothly and reliably. It can even be used to run games that have been created for Windows (although the reverse isn't necessarily the case). Many commercial games, such as Playstation 3, come with Linux ready installed. 7. Windows is a commercial product, and as such, it needs to take account of its customers' opinions and requirements. The support you get from Windows is generally considered to be better and faster.<query> what is the difference between windows and unix</query> 8. Perhaps the final deciding factor is that of cost. Linux is open source, and therefore free. It's always going to be cheaper than Windows, which, when all is said and done, is there to make money for Microsoft. In the end, the difference between Linux and Windows is very small. Unless you're a heavy user or a professional, you're unlikely to notice it. Your choice may well come down to personal taste, rather than technical considerations. Try both, and see which one feels right for you.

clueweb12-0202wb-94-15779,23,2,"Diabetes Searches with Google Advanced Search Diabetes Searches with Google By David Mendosa Most of us use the Web search engine called Google. In a few short years it has replacedYahoo! , AltaVista, and a myriad of other sites as the search engine responsible for more traffic to Web sites than any other, according to a recentrating. Google is intelligent. If you use Google, you might assume that you don't need to read this column. But if you don't learn anything here about how to make better use of it, I will buy you a free subscription. Actually, Google is totally free anyway. If I could, I would put my money where my word processor is. I use Google exclusively in searching for information for my articles on the Web, as well as checking out my non-professional interests there.<query> what search engine is used for diabetes</query> It has everything that a search engine needs, and a lot more. The key ingredients are size, speed, and relevance. With more than 3 billion Web pages, no other search engine comes close. When I searched for ""diabetes,"" it reported in 0.17 seconds that there were about 3,100,000 pages that mentioned that term and displayed links in context to the 100 most relevant pages. Google is intelligent. What sets it apart the most from other search engines is its PageRank software, which founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed when they were students at Stanford University. PageRank uses the Web's link structure as an indicator of an individual page's value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote by page A for page B. But Google also analyzes the page that casts the vote.<query> what is google's search engine</query> Votes cast by pages that themselves get a lot of votes help the pages they are linked to get more votes. Then, Google combines PageRank with sophisticated text-matching techniques to find pages that are both important and relevant to your search. This means the first pages that Google returns are usually the best ones on that subject. Google has many special features. It groups different pages at the same site together. One feature that I use all the time are ""cached"" links, which is what the page looked like when Google found it by crawling the Web. If the page is unavailable when I find it through a Google search, I click on ""Cache"" to see the page as it looked when Google found it. If you know the Web site you want to search, but don't know where the information is located within that site, you can use Google to search only that domain.<query> what is google cache</query> You do this by entering what you're looking for followed by the word ""site"" and a colon followed by the domain name. For example, if you wanted to know what this site has to say about the all-important A1c test, you would enter this: A1c site:diabetes.org When I did that as I prepared this column, it instantly returned 124 pages, listing my most recent column about ""A1C<7"" here first. I especially like Google's way with words. It's smart enough to guess the correct spelling of a search term. This morning, I searched for the fund where a friend of mine works. I spelled it ""semperverens,"" the spelling used on just three sites. So it asked me, ""Did you mean: sempervirens,"" because that term shows up more than 55,000 times, and the Sempervirens Fund that I was looking for was the first link it returned when I accepted Google's spelling suggestion.<query> how to spell a1c</query> You can also use Google to find the most common spelling or punctuation of a word. For example, ""e-mail"" shows up 9,980,000 times, a slight preference over ""email"" at 9,940,000. It's a dictionary too. By clicking on the top entry for the word searched, you will bring up many dictionaries with their definitions. All this is just in Google's main search engine. But it also has several special search sites. What if you want to find what the government has to say about diabetes? There are hundreds, if not thousands, of government sites. But Google searches them all for you if you use<Unclesam>. Google also has replaced DejaNews.com as the site where you can search newsgroups. It stores the entire archive of Usenet discussion groups dating back to 1981, more than 700 million posts.<query> what is google search for</query> It includes 232,000 in misc.health.diabetes, 139,000 in alt.support.diabetes, 10,100 in alt.support.diabetes.uk, and 6,560 in alt.support.diabetes.kids. The newest part of Google lets you search the news. Still in beta, Google News lets you search 4,000 news sites within minutes of the news going up. I search almost daily for stories that mentiondiabetes . There are so many articles that it can be almost overwhelming. There's lots more including a Web directory like Yahoo! uses and about 400 million images. Another tool provides a rough translation from English to five other languages and visa versa. Finally, if you install the Google toolbar, you can speed up your searches even more. Does it sound like I own stock in Google? I'm certainly pushing it, but I am sorry to say that I don't own any of it. Google is privately held, and I'm not a holder.

It's something I've always wanted to do so will at some point, and hopefully often siraff wrote:Quite a few nice options to have there and 1100 miles to make sure you got it right. Personally I really like the 159 design wise - it's a nice thing to sit in and drives reasonable well for it's size and weight. I know there are a lot of rumours about reliability but they really are based on fact in the case of most Alfa's.<query> how many miles is a alfa 159</query> Most of the time it's annoying electrical gremlins and dodgy switches/etc but now and then they completely spit the dummy out (like a gearbox, engine/etc). Considering the money you're spending I wouldn't want the risk - also remember you will get more Alfa for your £10k but come sale time it will have lost a LOT more than a £10k BMW. £10k is pushing it but I did see a nice 325i M Sport for around that price, not much over 40k on the clock - not sure if that's a good price. It's a 2006. The equivalent Alfa is a few £K less, which would be easier but.. siraff wrote:Have you looked at the 1 series? Being a hatch you have easier boot access and fold down seats make it like a small van.<query> what is the best price for an alfa</query> Rear leg room isn't great though. They drive very well and have a decent range of engines (have a look at a 123d or any of the larger petrols). I was never keen on the 1 series though. I like the coupe, but the hatchback doesn't really float my boat. I think the new ones are an improvement but out of my price range. siraff wrote:If you're going to be doing a few longer runs you're better off with a large engine or diesel. The torque is nice for relaxed cruising - even a 320d will sit very happily at whatever realistic speed you want. I find the smaller petrols a bit gutless if I'm honest How small is small? I would probably be looking at a 325i. siraff wrote:some people love them - but I think for a heavy car it needs a bit of shove to get it going without loads of revs.<query> what is the best diesel engine for a car</query> If you're looking at 6 cylinders the difference in engine size doesn't make all that much difference in economy at the same speed. It's only when you start using the extra power that you really pay for it. You could get a 335d for that kind of money - good for very impressive MPG and power but auto only. I would say a 325i would be the smallest petrol I would buy for a fun drive. A 335i can still do reasonable MPG for what it is and if you're dead set on a petrol I think that's the way I would be going. The price does seem to go up a lot after 325i (for M Sport at least) from what I've seen. That's another decision; M Sport or SE. Some would say SE for longer journeys (I do a lot of trips to London and Essex, both at least 100 miles from me), though obviously that's a picnic compared to Europe jaunts! Absolutely want manual - I love manual (I've had both in the past - automatic not by choice, was given to me after I blew up the Audi).. siraff wrote:I think for me it would be the 123d, 335d, 330d(manual), 135i or 335i.<query> what is the smallest petrol car</query> Good, efficient engines with the right space and some good power to back it up. If you've not driven a modern BMW diesel I would strongly suggest trying one out before deciding on a petrol. I prefer the drive of the diesel for the road regardless of MPG. Okay I'll be sure to give them a go. Thanks for your thorough advice, it is very helpful. And yes it's a shame about the Alfa because it is so nice looking and a nice place to be. Have you known people who've had them then? Would be interesting to know the AA / RAC figures on them. I guess I shouldn't worry about the image the BMW might give me; it's the driving pleasure I want afterall. Decisions decisions ..

Much more secure than having a bike outside the car. If you do go rack route - towbar is really the only sensible option.........very secure, efficient from a fuel perspective and easy to load and unload. Roofracks work very well (Thule bars & 951 bike carrier) but create a lot of drag on long journeys, sometimes a bit more difficult to load since they're lifted above you, and also not as secure - my friend has his £4k SantaCruz Heckler stolen from the top of his car. 57, 535d LCI M Sport, Deep Sea Blue, Cream Leather, Media & Visibility Packs, Active Cruise + Stop & Go, DAB, Elec Memory Fr seats, Ext.<query> can you use roofrack for mountain biking</query> Moderator: Moderators Write comments 8 posts • Page1 of 1 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Digg Share on Delicious Choosing a new car, maybe a BMW, maybe Alfa, or.. by MarkS » Wed, 21 Mar 2012 15:34:50 UTC Hi all, This is my first post here. I'm in the market for a new car (2nd hand). I've always fancied a BMW, my dad had them when I was young and always liked them, so I'm considering something like a BMW 3 series M Sport (E90). However, I'm also tempted by an Alfa 159 (either 2.2 JTS or 2.4 JTDm). I want something which is a bit of fun, something I can go across the channel in and explore Europe a bit and enjoy driving it, something fairly practical (I play the drums so need to be able to fit my kit in it though it isn't that big), and reliable would be good too, though I know that varies more from car to car than marquee to marquee.<query> what kind of car is a bmw</query> Folding & dim mirrors, Seat heating front, USB, 172-19"" alloys, M Spoiler, detachable tow-bar. spuffington Site Supporter Posts: 1945 Joined: Fri, 28 Mar 2008 20:15:33 UTC BMW Members Cars: E60 LCI 535d A M Sport Location: Essex & Frankfurt am Main Top Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Digg Share on Delicious Re: Choosing a new car, maybe a BMW, maybe Alfa, or.. by neilos1 » Thu, 22 Mar 2012 11:58:01 UTC I drove a 159 2.4 JTDM before buying my 320d M sport. In my opinion the 3 series is much, much better to drive. Thought the 159 had a fair amount of body roll, feels heavy and isnt a sporty drive at all.<query> what is the best bmw to buy</query> Considering the 2.4 JTDM has 200 bhp its not that much faster than a 320d, and uses a shedload more fuel in the process. It seems like in trying to improve build quality Alfa are using seriously heavy duty materieals as most of their range is a long way off class leading performance or economy for the relevant engine size. What the Alfa had in its favour was price, looks (both inside and out) and a softer ride. In terms of driving pleasure it wasnt even close to a 3 series. neilos1 Posts: 141 Joined: Sat, 26 Mar 2011 00:53:26 UTC BMW Members Cars: E46 320d M Sport Top Display posts from previous: All posts1 day7 days2 weeks1 month3 months6 months1 year Sort by AuthorPost timeSubject AscendingDescending Write comments 8 posts • Page 1 of 1 Return to General BMW Help/Advice Jump to: Select a forum ------------------ BMW Forum: General General BMW Help/Advice Discounts on Genuine BMW Parts: BMW Cotswold Group BMW Car Cleaning - BMW Wash, BMW Wax, BMW Polish & BMW Detailing BMW UK Events & BMW car Shows BMW Car Modifications BMW Garages Buy & Sell: cars, parts, items Technical Zone BMW Forums FAQ's BMW Forums: UK car owners BMW 1 series Forum BMW 3 series Forum BMW 5 series Forum BMW 6 Series Forum BMW 7 Series Forum BMW 8 Series Forum BMW X1, X3, X5 & X6 Series Forum BMW Z series Forum BMW Bikes Forum BMW Forum: Miscellaneous BMW Tyres and Wheel Advice BMW Car Manual/Handbook 1 series BMW car owners manual 3 series BMW car owners manual 5 series BMW car owners manual 6 series BMW car owners manual 7 series BMW car owners manual 8 series BMW car owners manual X1 series BMW car owners manual X3 series BMW car owners manual X5 series BMW car owners manual X6 series BMW car owners manual Z1 series BMW car owners manual Z3 series BMW car owners manual Z4 series BMW car owners manual Z8 series BMW car owners manual BMW News and Current Affairs Forum BMW<query> what is the difference between bmw 320d and bmw 3 series</query> For example, the engine went on my 1.8 Audi A3 (1999 model) after 100,000 miles due to the oil pick up pipe getting blocked (damn those long service intervals - carbon build up) Someone here at work had a newer Audi A3 and had to have his engine replaced after just a few thousand miles. My uncle who worked for Jag and had some involvement in engine development seems to think Alfa is fine these days (he has a 159) and not to believe the horror stories.. Though he's only had it for 10,000 miles (bought at 80,000). He's actually offered to sell it to me as he wants one with mileage, but it's only a 1.9 JTDm... But anyway, I measured up and I think I can fit my bass drum into the passenger door of a BMW 3 series (though not the boot).<query> how many miles does an audi engine go</query> It's basically 20"" in diameter, 17.5"" depth so fairly big. The rest would easily go in the boot. I can just about manage £10K for a BMW, the Alfas are a fair bit cheaper, though I just wish they had a bigger engine range. The 325i whips the Alfa (according to the 0-62 figures at least) and uses less fuel - unless you go for the 3.2 which uses a huge amount of petrol. I really prefer petrol to Diesel.. I don't know why, I just do - so that is my preference. I'm not totally against diesel though.. I don't have to fit anyone in the back often, though I want to be able to fit people in the back with a fair amount of comfort. So - anyone got any experience with both?<query> what is the difference between a bmw and alfa</query> One of my worries with the BMW is image - getting sneared at by other drivers. I don't live in the best area (it wasn't too bad, once upon a time); I just worry about daft things like that I like the BMW because I like the idea of a drivers car, RWD, etc. and I love the nice build quality. I did consider the Alfa Brera, but if only it was just a few inches longer so people could actually sit in the back, it'd be perfect. My A3 was about perfect for me (even though a little cramped in the back). I don't think I want another Audi - I don't really like the newer ones. I actually prefer my old 1999 Audi to the new ones! I was going to rush in and buy something by the end of April.<query> why do bmws have better seats</query> I have a festival to play in Slovakia, but the rest are flying and perhaps driving over 1100 miles for my first time driving in Europe isn't the best idea! Hell of an adventure though.. but probably better to take my time and not rush into buying something.

I am going to keep this short and sweet, don’t know that much about alphas so cant help you there. If you’re going to drive 11000 miles across Europe (well jealous BTW) you should go for a diesel, think you should go with a BMW 330D saloon M sport.<query> what kind of car do you drive in europe</query> Musa_newbie_bmw Posts: 6 Joined: Sun, 11 Mar 2012 09:47:47 UTC BMW Members Cars: 3 SERIES 318 Top Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Digg Share on Delicious Re: Choosing a new car, maybe a BMW, maybe Alfa, or.. by siraff » Wed, 21 Mar 2012 21:20:41 UTC Quite a few nice options to have there and 1100 miles to make sure you got it right. Personally I really like the 159 design wise - it's a nice thing to sit in and drives reasonable well for it's size and weight. I know there are a lot of rumours about reliability but they really are based on fact in the case of most Alfa's. Most of the time it's annoying electrical gremlins and dodgy switches/etc but now and then they completely spit the dummy out (like a gearbox, engine/etc).<query> how many miles does a bmw have</query> Considering the money you're spending I wouldn't want the risk - also remember you will get more Alfa for your £10k but come sale time it will have lost a LOT more than a £10k BMW. Have you looked at the 1 series? Being a hatch you have easier boot access and fold down seats make it like a small van. Rear leg room isn't great though. They drive very well and have a decent range of engines (have a look at a 123d or any of the larger petrols). If you're going to be doing a few longer runs you're better off with a large engine or diesel. The torque is nice for relaxed cruising - even a 320d will sit very happily at whatever realistic speed you want. I find the smaller petrols a bit gutless if I'm honest - some people love them - but I think for a heavy car it needs a bit of shove to get it going without loads of revs.<query> what kind of engine does a bmw have</query> If you're looking at 6 cylinders the difference in engine size doesn't make all that much difference in economy at the same speed. It's only when you start using the extra power that you really pay for it. You could get a 335d for that kind of money - good for very impressive MPG and power but auto only. I would say a 325i would be the smallest petrol I would buy for a fun drive. A 335i can still do reasonable MPG for what it is and if you're dead set on a petrol I think that's the way I would be going. I think for me it would be the 123d, 335d, 330d(manual), 135i or 335i. Good, efficient engines with the right space and some good power to back it up. If you've not driven a modern BMW diesel I would strongly suggest trying one out before deciding on a petrol.<query> what is the smallest petrol engine</query>"

Both have succeeded in the white heat of competition, and proved that the race track and rally stage are the best proving grounds for new products. Over the decades, Audi and BMW have developed their sporting brands to the point where they have become shorthand for excellence. Both the Quattro and M badges are revered, enjoying a fanatical following from owners and enthusiasts alike. Although BMW has held the upper hand in the performance coupé market for nearly 25 years with the M3, Audi is hitting back with its most powerful and focused rival to date – the RS5. It recalls the classic Quattro coupés of the Eighties, with stunning looks, breathtaking performance and four-wheel drive. However, it will need to be at the very top of its game to see off the latest offering from BMW – the M3 Competition Pack.<query> what is the difference between audi and bmw</query> With a mighty V8, bespoke suspension set-up, unique wheels and revised stability control software, it’s the sharpest M3 on the market.

Both cars are supremely capable and hugely entertaining to drive, whether you’re on the shopping run or taking in a lap of the Nordschleife.<query> what is the fastest bmw</query> The BMW is the benchmark machine. Breathtakingly efficient, the addition of the new Competition Pack has made it sharper and even more engaging to drive. The Audi, on the other hand, is simply one of the best fast coupés the company has ever produced. Its drivetrain is sophisticated yet smooth, while the design – both inside and out – is wonderfully executed. However, judged purely on the job they are designed to do, it’s the BMW that takes an extremely narrow victory. Yes, the RS5 is bigger and more refined than the M3, but the Munich machine has an almost indefinable edge that delivers more seat-of-the-pants excitement. 1. BMW M3 Comp. Pack Simply because it has been around for a few years, don’t discount the BMW. The changes brought about by the new Competition Pack give the coupé a fresh lease of life.<query> what is the difference between audi and bmw</query> Both of these cars are designed for enthusiasts, so while the Audi is the sensible bet, the more enjoyable BMW is the car we would choose... just! 2. Audi RS5 Defeats simply don’t get much narrower than this. In most measurable respects, the Audi is the superior car, but it lacks the dynamic brilliance of the BMW. What you do get is the security of four-wheel drive, a more luxurious cabin and extra interior space. - Advertisement - Company Website | Media Information | Contact Us | Privacy Notice | Subs Info | Voucher Codes | Sitemap Our Other Websites:The Week | Custom PC | Evo | IT Pro | IT Pro India | MacUser | Men's Fitness | Micro Mart | PC Pro | bit-tech | Know Your Mobile | Octane | Expert Reviews | Channel Pro | Know Your Cell | Know Your Mobile India | iGizmo |Digital SLR Photography | Den of Geek | Computer Shopper | Dennis Communications | Magazines | Mobile Phone Deals | Competitions | Health & Fitness | CarBuyer | Cloud Pro | MagBooks | Mobile Test | LITS © 2012 Dennis Publishing Limited.<query> which is superior bmw or audi</query>"

MadSci Network: Chemistry Query: Re: Does prolonged use (addiction) of caffiene affect one's metabolism? Date: Fri Oct 1 08:51:54 1999 Posted By: Mary Hadley, Faculty, Food and Nutrition, North Dakota State University Area of science:Chemistry ID: 938484268.Ch Message: Hi! One of my colleagues found this web site: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/caffeine-faq/ You might like to check it out. Caffeine belongs to a group of compounds called methylxanthines. Another compound in this class of chemicals istheophylline which is found in tea. I will define metabolism before answering your question. Scientists define 'metabolism' as all the chemical reactions that occur in a living organism. We do know that both caffeine and theophylline inhibit an enzyme (phosphodiesterase) that inactivates c-AMP.<query> does caffiene affect metabolism</query> Through several steps, the inhibition of phosphodiesterase leads to increased blood glucose and fatty acid levels along with increased oxygen consumption and for so for short periods of time we feel more alert. So, although caffeine inhibits only one enzyme, the consequences of that inhibition are far reaching and many many enzymatic reactions are influenced. Effects of caffeine High caffeine (3-5 cups of coffee a dayor 200-400 mg caffeine/day) or theophylline intake increase excreation of calcium in the urine and may have some role in osteoporosis. How it does this is not clear. Tea has a little less caffeine per cup than coffee. Remember too that many cola drinks have caffeine. Heart rate increases and so does the amount of blood pumped each time the heart pumps. Very large doses of caffeine can cause very fast irregular heart beat.<query> does caffeine affect phosphodiesterase</query> Scientist think the effects of caffeine are most likely due to caffeine competing with adenosine for a receptor on nervous tissue. Adenosine inhibits neuronal activity so when caffeine gets into the receptor there is no inhibition. Prolonged large intakes of caffeine may lead to flu like-symptoms. The jolt one gets from a given amount of coffee decreases with time so one must drink more and more to get the same effect. Lastly, there are many studies in which caffeine has been SUGGESTED to play a role in several diseases. For instance, there are reports in the literature in which very high caffeine intake has been related to: children born missing fingers or toes elevated blood cholesterol abnormal blood pressure fibrocystic breast disease However, there is no definitive answer as to the role of caffeine in these conditions or in different forms of humancancer.<query> does caffeine cause flu like symptoms</query> Hope that helps.

clueweb12-1905wb-38-16188,43,2,"Many Canon shooters use both cameras and if you can afford it, this will make a fantastic combination for bird photography. The 1Ds Mark III and the 5D Mark II are better suited for landscape work but will also work well for birds if you don't need the extra pixels a crop factor will give you with distant birds. The 5D Mark II will give you better results at high ISO settings than a 7D due to the larger pixel size of the 5D Mark II. But beside, the slightly better sensor, the 7D is a better camera than the 5D Mark II in almost every way. The AF of the 7D is much better and the 8 fps are much better than the 3.9 fps in the 5D Mark II. The Canon EOS 50D is also a good camera but the EOS 7D isn't much more expensive and a better camera in every way.<query> what is the difference between a 7d and a 5d</query> I do not recommend using the EOS 50D. Use the EOS 7D instead. If you shoot with Nikon, I recommend the D300s. It has a great 12 MP sensor, very fast AF, full weather sealing and can shoot up to 8 fps. If you prefer a full frame sensor, go for the D700. The D3s has even better AF than the D300s, a more robust body and an even faster frame rate (9 fps or even 11 without AF tracking). The 1.5 crop sensor of the D300s will give you more pixels per bird than with a 12 MP full frame sensor like the D3s or D700. The D3X is mostly suited for landscape photographers but the high resolution is great for large prints and allows a lot of cropping. The frame rate is not as high as with the D3s, though.<query> what is the best nikon camera for landscape</query> For bird photographers I recommend the D300s or the D3s (or a combination of both if you can afford it).

Forgot Password? Powered By JFBConnect Choosing a digital SLR camera for bird photography In this article, I want to give you some tips on how to choose the right camera for bird photography. If you are new to bird photography, it may seem hard to pick the right camera, as today there are more digital SLR cameras then ever. You can create bird photographs with every current DSLR but it's worth paying attention to certain features that may give you an advantage in some situations. For example, a camera that can shoot 8 frames per seconds (fps) has a higher change of getting a winner in an action scene than a camera that can only shoot 3 fps. The following tips will help you to pick the right camera for you.<query> what camera do you use for bird photography</query> Which brand? That’s an easy question. Canon or Nikon. Period. Although the cameras of other manufacturers are not bad, Canon and Nikon offer the best and the most professional cameras (at the time of this writing examples are the Nikon D3s, D3X, D700 and D300s and the Canon the EOS 1D Mark IV, EOS 1Ds Mark III, EOS 5D Mark II and EOS 7D). In addition Nikon and Canon have the greatest selection of lenses and other useful utilities like extenders. Canon and Nikon are currently the only companies that offer a 4/500 with image stabilization. Sigma has a 4.5/500, but without stabilization and a slower AF than the Canon and Nikon lenses. And the Sigma is also available for Nikon and Canon, if you want to use that lens (I recommend using the Canon or Nikon 4/500 lenses).<query> which camera brand has the best image stabilization</query> Sony recently announced a 4/500 but this is not yet available. The 4/500 is one of the best choices for the serious bird photographer and I use a 4/500 myself for over 90% of my bird pictures.. If you are serious about bird photography and want the best equipment currently available, choose either Nikon or Canon. How many megapixels? The number of megapixels (MP) has dramatically increased during the last years and several models now offer more than 20 MP. Canon's 1Ds Mark III and 5D Mark II offer about 21 MP. Nikon's D3X has even 24.6 MP. I think for most cases 10 or 12 MP are enough, but more pixels allow more cropping without loosing too much quality. The 18 MP of my Canon EOS 7D allows a lot of cropping while still having enough pixels for high quality prints.<query> what is the best camera for bird photography</query> If you are also doing a lot of landscape photography, you might want to get a camera with more MP to make large prints. Often you will use a different camera for landscape photography than for bird photography. For example, at this moment a combination of the EOS 7D for birds and the EOS 5D Mark II for landscapes is a great and often used combination for Canon photographers. Crop factor or full frame? Let’s use an example to demonstrate the point why I like a camera with a crop factor. Nikon’s D300s and D3s both have about 12 MP of resolution. When shooting with the 4/500 VR lens from Nikon, the 1.5 crop factor of the D300s will give you the bird with the same size in the image as if the picture were taken with the D3s and a 750 mm (500 x 1.5) lens.<query> what is crop factor for photography</query> That means, when you photograph a bird with a 4/500 with both the D300s and the D3s from the same distance, you will get much more pixels per bird with the D300s than with the D3s. That will allow you to make bigger prints. But keep in mind, that the full frame sensor of the D3s (and D700) has better image quality. You probably won’t notice this at all up to ISO 400 but above ISO 800, the difference becomes noticeable. What else is important? The camera should have a fast and accurate autofocus (AF). Canon and Nikon currently have both very good AF systems. As a rule, the more expensive camera often has the better AF. That’s because those cameras have more processing power and a more sophisticated AF system. A Nikon D3s and D300s will perform much better than a Nikon D90.<query> what is the difference between a nikon d3s and a d And a Canon EOS 7D and 1D Mark IV are better than a Canon EOS 1000D. The camera should be able to shoot at least 5 frames per second (fps). That’s important when you are shooting action scenes like fighting birds or birds in flight. A camera with 8 fps will give you a much higher chance to get a good shot than a camera that can only shoot 3 fps. The camera should have weather sealing, if you will be using it in difficult weather situations like heavy rain, or dusty areas like a dessert or at the ocean shore. The camera should also deliver good image quality up to ISO 800 or even better 1600, which is the case with most current Nikon and Canon cameras. The lens is more important than the camera Keep in mind that the lens is more important than the camera.<query> what is the best camera for bird watching</query> It’s better to buy a Canon EOS 7D with a 4/500 lens than a EOS 1D Mark IV with just a 4/300 lens. It's the photographer – not the equipment Although good equipment is important, a good camera alone won’t take good pictures. If you want to get great bird photographs, you have to learn about the life and behavior of birds and spend a lot of time in the field. This is much more important than your camera! That said, it pays to invest in good equipment and learn how to use it. Make sure to read the manual of your camera until you are familiar with all it's features. If you don't know how to efficiently handle your camera, you will miss many beautiful photographs! What do I recommend? I currently use a Canon EOS 7D (and a 40D as a backup) and am very happy with that camera.<query> what camera do you use to take bird photos</query> If you use Canon, the EOS 7D is a fantastic choice at a very attractive price. If you have more money to spend, think about the EOS 1D Mark IV. That camera has received a lot of praise and is the best DSLR for bird photographers Canon has built so far. Compared to the 7D, the 1D Mark IV offers an even better AF, a more robust body, 10 frames per second, better high ISO performance, and a lot of other small advantages. That said, the 7D is a fantastic camera and with the money you save compared to the 1D Mark IV, you can already pay half of the price of a EF 4/500L IS. The 7D will also give you more pixels per bird than the 1D Mark IV as it has 18 instead of 16 MP and a smaller sensor (1.6 crop factor compared to 1.3 in the 1D Mark IV).<query> what is the best bird camera</query>"

Marketing Design Digital Follow us on Twitter Watch us on YouTube Apple surpasses Microsoft to become largest technology company Written byLee Hampton+ on 28 May 2010 For the first time since the late 1980s, Apple has, this week, surpassed Microsoft in terms of it's total value, making it the largest technology company in the world. The choppy trading which has taken place recently, has resulted in fluctuating share prices and on Wednesday, the total value of Apple reached $222bn (£154bn), whilst Microsoft's valuation came in at $219bn. Is this the end of Microsoft?<query> what is the largest technology company</query> Looking at the bigger picture, it's clear that Microsoft remains more profitable than Apple and also has a substantially healthier (annual) net profit, but the shift in overall value does represent a significant achievement for the California based company, which nearly went out of business in the '90s. The iPod is key to Apple's success The success of Apple is largely down to it's ability to create ground-breaking peripheral products - rather than simply focusing on the desktop computer market - which Microsoft still dominates (its operating system is installed on around 90% of all personal computers across the world). In 2001, Apple unveiled it's first iPod, and almost 10 years later, the iPod is still in production and has certainly pushed the limits in terms of what a portable music device is capable of.<query> why is apple so successful</query> One could argue that the iPod has led to the creation of the iPhone, which then led to the iPad - a device which is expected to do very well in the UK, after great success in the US. Whilst it is possible to use each of these products in conjunction with a Microsoft-based personal computer, more and more people are making the switch from Microsoft to Apple as a result of their 'portal device experiences'. That said, Apple really does owe an awful lot to the iPod. Be sociable with us...

The really top institutions cannot be bought that way; for example Harvard's endowment is valued at $32 billion. It does help to have a parent who went to that college, especially if they are either unusually successful or consistently active in the alumni association. For everyone else the matter is straightforward: make certain there is no weak spot in your application (grades all B and above, etc.) and have something in your favor that 10,000 valedictorians don't have. A state championship in something usually does it. There are many other possibilities; pursue an interest with enough seriousness and depth to produce results.

One of the classes I took at Yale was so incredibly formative that it changed my career goal and got me hooked on philosophies of law I never would have encountered otherwise.

College applications are kind of an exercise in BS-ology. You have to groom this phony image of being well-rounded, interested in everything, nice enough to volunteer for ""good"" causes, etc. It's all BS. Fortunately, once you get to grad school, at least in science and engineering, all that fluff becomes irrelevant. In some European countries, the way you make it into the most prestigious universities is by taking an entrance exam. Everyone gets a grade and a rank based on it (no names show). Then they go down the list until all spots are filled.

FaceBook Twitter Email Share 27 Comments RSS 0 Like comment by Dave 486 days ago The US bishops seem to have been happy with the idea of a US universal health care system. I would think, not so much to extend coverage, which is clearly fairly good, but to make doing so less expensive, or probably more accurately justly sharing the burden. The more the US bishops and their associated hospitals can collect in excess money, the more we extend health coverage to other countries, just as we do now. It would be nice if they could set up medical schools in Africa, for instance, this would be a just remittance for their offering so many quality physicians to the US.<query> why is universal health care good</query> I personally, do not the the Federal government as the best venue (subsidiarity) for where to make this decision, but many states are demoralized and seem to rely on the fed for everything, rather than figuring their own stuff out. One thing to remember about the US health care system is that the rapidly rising health care costs are destabilizing the economy to some extent, but this seems to be based in the mass collection of wealth by the top 1%. Sad, but true, while my conservative use of government nature indicates that messing unnecessarily is bad, something about the current pay scale seems incredibly bad for mankind, really, the whole world is now subject to our ruling class. What exactly is basic health care is complicated in wealthy countries (which hip replacement? Which prosthesis?), but much less so in poorer countries.<query> why is the health care system bad</query> It is not that the US doesn't have hard decisions to make. What do we do? We have to leave stuff to the professionals, as the bishops would prefer, but we can't ignore death in the current plan, otherwise, aside from lying about it nature in other ways, it might be just fine. It's obviously true that increasing basic stuff in the West like cancer screenings (mammograms) are going to raise overall costs. If the US people got raising in line with company and economic growth in the country, it is unlikely that the increases in medical costs would be problem. People have the obligation to use the government for some things, level dependent on specific needs (venue size).

clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238,68,2,"Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizingonline college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one. The Power of Telecommunications in Online Education In this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience. They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.<query> what is the power of telecommunications in education</query> ""New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century"" (Anonymous, 1997). Telecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as ""the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible"" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).<query> what is the importance of telecommunications technology</query> Earning Your Online Degree The millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals. You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods. Technological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education The convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information. The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools.<query> why do people want to earn their degree online</query> No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997). Without question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to ""multipoint technology"" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike. Telecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they ""promote career advancement [and] continued education"" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world.<query> what is the benefit of telecommunications technology</query> As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.

If you are new here, you might want tosubscribe to the RSS feed for updates on this topic. “Oh no” I can hear you say, an article about education. Boring. Yet it should be one of the most exciting things you can read about. It is the education industry and their heritage that have made it boring. And if it is boring for us then just imagine how boring it must be for the victims of our current system.<query> why are classrooms obsolete</query> What seems more apt is that what schools do the most is provide the kind of parenting and socialization that games cannot provide. Most learning is socially constructed, distributed, and mediated. Where will they play these games and who will be their mentors then? #4 Robin on 03.31.09 at 2:56 pm I agree with Brock’s point that there still needs to be a face-to-face social element to child development, which technology can assist but not replace. I don’t agree that traditional school systems fulfil this role very effectively at all. There are too many arbitrary, outdated rules governing social interaction, organisation and time management. The adult environment that schools most closely resemble is prison, which should be a cause for concern. #5 Deirdre on 03.31.09 at 9:38 pm I homeschooled my daughter using a lot of educational games and she learned to be independent and problem focused.<query> what is the role of the school system in child development</query> Traditional high school was a terrible step backward for her, even the social aspect frustrated her because of the avoidance of learning even among the “best” students. So as a teacher, it is difficult for me to argue that the present method of schooling should continue. #6 Stone Bytes on 04.04.09 at 10:58 pm One teacher for a group of around five students top is what I call real, efficient and social education. Considering the crap taught in schools and how the educational systems in many countries are being destroyed year after year, I would not be surprised to hear about a rise of such educational methods. That internet based learning system is not good enough. There needs to be a true human contact. #7 Marshal Anderson on 04.14.09 at 7:40 pm I guess the problem I have with this is that it sets out games as /the solution/ to education, but that it doesn’t actually say what it takes education to be.<query> why is social education necessary</query> I don’t think anyone would disagree that education in the west is currently floundering and lacking any kind of coherent approach, and I personally am not against the possibility that the only solution is to tear it all down and start again – but to suggest that the answer lies in a particular medium without any idea of what the message might be doesn’t really take us anywhere. It seems very much based on a behaviourist approach which assumes that some form of immediate reward reinforces learning. While there’s evidence this works in the learning of some skills and the memorisation of knowledge, there’s a whole bunch more stuff to education than long division and lists of kings and queens (or presidents). I’m really keen to see games technologies contribute to education, but for that to happen we need to avoid polarisation – the more I read about this issue the more I find it’s split between extremes of opinion like the above; give us ideas for how busy teachers today can benefit their students with this technology, within the constraints of society’s conflicting demands on education, so that we have more than a handful of gifted enthusiasts with projects that most schools simply can’t aspire to.<query> what is the role of games in education</query> Huggs :O) Marshal #8 Michael J on 10.27.09 at 12:15 pm Brilliant!

We are massive consumers of education. We start in formal education as toddlers and emerge in our 20s. Often none the wiser. And we learn far more out of school than we do in school. Then we have vocational training, usually continuously in our fast changing world. Plus our hobbies and interests that can often involve absorbing more knowledge than a degree course. Which all means that education is a massive industry. Far bigger than the recreational game industry is going to be for the foreseeable future. Which is very nice for us because gaming is perfectly suited to education. Far more so than the current classroom/teacher system. Our one on one, challenge-reward mechanism is the most perfect way yet of imparting knowledge.<query> what is the difference between education and gaming</query> I have watched our industry try to get into education for thirty years. And failing, continually. Because we try to do learning using games. We try and fit in with the old, inefficient teacher led systems. But we have had successes when we don’t try to fit in. Dr Kawashima’s Brain Training, for instance. And these successes come when there isn’t a teacher in sight, because they are true game based learning. And teachers and true game based education are incompatible. You cannot have them both at the same time. Teachers, at best, think that games are chocolate coated broccoli. A way of dressing up knowledge to make it palatable. They are wrong. Gaming is the optimum delivery system for giving the human mind knowledge. Because it is one on one interactive, because it creates exactly the right challenges at exactly the right time, because it can readily mix text with sound with pictures with videos, because it rewards the student properly at exactly the right time, because it is connected to the sum of all human knowledge, because it is non linear thus presenting knowledge in a more natural way, because it progresses the student at exactly the right pace and because it is connected to countless other people.<query> why is gaming an optimum delivery system</query> With proper game based learning it is very simple to keep a track of every student’s progress. But more than that it is very easy to see their strengths and weaknesses in all their complexity. The aptitudes of every single student will be plain to see. Which would lead to everyone having the optimum further education and making the right career choices for their abilities. Which would be a massive improvement on the current hit and miss methodology. So students wouldn’t just learn more, with better understanding and more quickly. They would also be learning the right things for them and for their life ahead. It isn’t just goodbye to classrooms and teachers. It is also goodbye to exams and school inspectors. Because any student’s knowledge and capabilities would be there to see in real time on the system. In fact exams are a very bad thing as they hold the majority of students back until everyone has mastered the syllabus to a given point.<query> why is game based learning important</query> With game based learning you are going to have a lot of people educated past degree level by the time they are 18. But the people who stand to gain most are those with “learning difficulties” who just cannot get all the attention they need with current learning methods. With game based learning they will have one on one learning that will push their aptitudes and capabilities to the limit resulting in much more fulfilling lives. So what are we going to do with all the teachers? Teach them to stack shelves in Tescos? Nope, there is something far more important for them to do and that is to prepare children for their futures in the real world. Not by teaching, but by mentoring. By guiding every single student, one on one, so each one can get the best out of our society and our society can get the best out of each student.<query> what is game based learning</query> Some educationalists who have a grasp of this seem to think that you still need a physical school. That each student has their own workstation. They call it “podularisation”. And they are wrong. All a student needs is a device connected to the interweb. A home computer,a netbook or even a smartphone . Yes, that’s right, smartphones replacing teachers. AndOnLive technology, or something similar, could be harnessed beautifully to deliver it all. The next thing that is going to shock is that much education will end up being free. Once it is all written and on a server the incremental cost for each extra student is zero. And as we have seen with so many things on the interweb there is an inevitable constant downwards price pressure till zero is reached. This will open up and democratise learning like never before.<query> what is the next step in education</query> It will be more influential than the invention of the printing press. Anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to consume whatever education they want any time they want, delivered to them in the optimum manner for them to absorb. This will massively advance the whole of humanity. I would like to thank Nolan Bushnell and all the other speakers at the Game Based Learning 2009 conference for stimulating my thoughts on this subject.

With this simple but explosive beginning, one of America’s most well respected professors of education looks seriously at the good that can come from playing video games. Gee is interested in the cognitive development that can occur when someone is trying to escape a maze, find a hidden treasure and, even, blasting away an enemy with a high powered rifle. Talking about his own video gaming experience learning and using games as diverse as Lara Croft and Arcanum, Gee looks at major specific cognitive activities: How individuals develop a sense of identity How one grasps meaning How one evaluates and follows a command How one picks a role model How one perceives the world This is a ground breaking book that takes up a new electronic method of education and shows the positive upside it has for learning.<query> who is paul gee</query> #2 Judy Valentine on 03.30.09 at 5:02 pm I’m not sure its the end of collective learning.

I have been studying games and learning and have found that most games, especially serious games have no valid or reliable system of measuring learning or transfer. Also, it seems fairly simplistic to assume that all kids like games, as I have found they do not; and more to the point, that all kids will like the same game.<query> what is the project called that uses mobile technology to teach</query>"

clueweb12-0813wb-45-14392,76,2,"It is a methyl ester of the phenylalanine dipeptide. This sweetener is approximatelytwo hundred times sweeter than table sugar, because of which its calorific contribution is negligible. Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners have a distinctive difference from the normal sugars, especially regarding the onset of sweetness and how long it lasts,though aspartame is the closest in terms of taste to the table sugar. Since the sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than sucrose, it is mostly used together with other artificialsweeteners to produce a more natural sugary taste . Primarily, aspartame was derived from aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol, which occur naturally in food through the processes of fermentation and synthesis. The direct fermentation process, which takes about three days, produces a contingent ofbacteria enough to produce the required amino acids. These bacteria are destroyed at the end of the process to remain with the amino acids.<query> what is aspartame made of</query> The synthesis process involves a number of chemical pathways, but generally in order to formaspartame phenylalanine is combined with methanol, then with aspartic acid. The solid residue made after the metacatalyst has been taken away is filtered in an aqueous ethanol solution and thenrecrystallized to give the powder aspartame. The natural residue components of aspartame are aspartic acid, methanol and phenylalanine, which are realized when this sweeteneris broken down once it has been digested. There occurs further digestion, the results being formaldehyde and formic acid, which is believed to bethe cause of injury in methanol poisoning if it accumulates. However, for those who have the condition called Phenylketonuria (PKU), the sweetener is not advisable to use simply because phenylalanine is not properly metabolized in this case. Aspartame holds one significant advantage – it offers a perfect option for diabetics or those on a low calorie diet to enjoy a wide variety of desserts with low fat.<query> what is the chemical name for aspartame</query> Its introduction in diet is good for the reduction of blood sugar levels for people suffering from diabetes. Much has been said about the benefits of aspartame, but, as a naturopathic nutritionist, I would not use this sweetener chiefly because of its side effects, which include eye and ear complications, psychological imbalances, neurologic complications and allergies. Although aspartame is currently the best alternative to natural sugar, scientists are still researching to find better options mainly on blending alternatives, improving aspartame efficiency and new derivatives.

clueweb12-1805wb-56-19245,92,2,"And again, one season may call for a slight modification of the work done the previous year. Thus you can easily see that it is impossible for anyone to lay down a fixed set of rules and follow them, in reference to each particular case. All well regulated cemeteries should have their own nursery so you could plant just whenever you have a favorable day. I have planted trees from our own nursery row as late as the third week in May, out in full leaf and without a single loss. This, of course, would be impossible if you had to buy your trees at some distance from home; hence the double advantage. It is common to note how little attention most people pay to the trees after they are once planted. Is it any wonder one sees so few really beautiful specimens? This is apparently due to the fact that they do not require his constant care, and usually seem to thrive without his aid; yet what a vast difference between a well trained, properly cared for tree and the one that has to take care of itself.<query> when to plant trees in a cemetery</query> Perhaps you have noticed in the early spring that a tree of a certain kind may come into flower earlier than another tree of the same variety. That which comes into flower earlier is the male, to be ready for its mate. In all of these elemental facts the tree is just as much alive as man himself and it presents an exceedingly interesting thing for one who is willing to think, to observe, to learn. I wish that it might be possible for people generally to see more into the great world of living things all about us. So often it happens that people go through the world and see almost nothing of the world in which they live. I think perhaps the most beautiful tribute to a tree that I ever heard was told by the President of the Elyria Ohio Rotary Club when I went down there several years ago to give this little talk on trees.<query> what is the meaning of tree</query> In introducing me he related this experience from his own life. He said, ""I have the most wonderful tree in the world at my house. Some fifteen years ago I had a little boy who was then three years of age. In the early fall he would go out to gather up the buckeyes, sometimes by pockets full and sometimes by baskets full, and bring them in and play with them. One day he took sick; the next day he was better. He went out as usual. This time he brought in just one large fine buckeye and played with it, and the next day he died. ""I took that large fine buckeye and carried it with me all the long winter. I would take it out every little while and look at it and was reminded of him. Then, when the spring came, I went out and planted it down under his sand pile.<query> when did buckeyes die</query> Later the sand pile was taken away, the buckeye sprouted and came up a healthy little plant. I built a fence around it and told the boys of the neighborhood that they might break anything, anything I had, the windows of my house or anything but please not to break this tree. They have respected my request and it stands there today, fifteen years old, the most wonderful tree in the world."" I thought as I listened to that story, that there was in this little tree not alone a monument to a little boy who died, but also a monument to a father's love. I wish that it might be possible for people to see something more in trees than just an accident, because as a matter of fact God Almighty put the trees here to help adorn the world. I have sometimes wondered what this world would be if we could remove from it all of the really fine things, if we could remove music, literature, art and religion and the beauty of the great outdoors—that great unmatched beauty of the world of living things.<query> why are trees important to the world</query> I have wondered what this world of ours would be. Have you ever thought of the immense importance of foliage? To the beauty of the world; to its livableness? Just remember, after the leaves have gone, this fall, when there is no blanket of white snow to cover the earth—then again in the early spring when the snow has gone, or is dirty. Look out across the landscape and see how ugly and barren it is. Then notice as the leaves come out and the grass comes forth, what a wonderful change there is with this color of green, this blanket of green that God put here to cover up the ugliness of a naked world. That is why it seems to me that we are likely to under estimate or perhaps neglect to think about the importance of trees to the world way beyond the question of their practical utility.<query> why are trees important</query> It seems to me that God must have known his business when he caused trees to grow upon this earth. You know there is one thing that does arouse me tremendously and that is to see the terrible butchery of trees. Almost everywhere I go I see this slaughter, very largely by the telephone and electric light companies—sometimes by, well, I will call them ""tree-quacks"", sometimes by well-meaning but ignorant tree owners who permit it. God intended that the tops should be on the trees. I am not saying that there is never a time when trees should not be cut back because sometimes it is necessary, if it is done right, but as a general proposition I think it is the most inexcusable thing that any man can be guilty of, to slaughter the trees as they grow. This is what happens: you cut the top of a tree off and you immediately destroy its circulation, and then naturally in her desperation she forces out the latent buds along the side of the stump, and presently you have a new and rather vigorous growth of new shoots, and that is what deceives a lot or people.<query> why do trees need to be cut back</query> They overlook the fact that the stump sticking up there is a constant invitation to disease. Science has demonstrated diseases in trees as it has in other forms of life. In trees it is called fungi, a parasite by nature; it lives by tearing down some other form of life. Now, wherever you see a decaying tree there is disease working and in a certain time of the year it throws out to the surface of the bark what they call fruiting bodies. You have seen them on the outside of trees; they look more or less like toadstools. Those fruiting bodies give off a myriad of microscopic spores that float through the air and most of them fall to the ground harmless, but some of those spores find lodgment in an open wound. It doesn't make any difference what causes the wound, it may be lightening or it may be a lawnmower in the hands of some careless man, anything that breaks the bark causes a wound and in to that wound some of these spores find their way and they start to grow, to send out their little threadlike tentacles, very much like cancer, and they travel up and down from one cell to another, eating, or consuming the cells.<query> what is the disease in trees called</query> That is what they live on, and finally you have internal decay. What we call decay is merely the result of this active disease that is working on the inside. You cannot have anything worse than a horizontal wound in a tree. You look at that wound under a microscope and it is very much like a sponge because the cells are hollow and you cut right across them and there you have your sponge-like effect, a constant invitation for the spores of the fungi to find lodgment there and start to grow and just as sure as the sun rises and sets there will be a decay because there is no life in that stump, there cannot be any life without leaves, so, down to the point where the new growth starts the decay proceeds and goes constantly on and on into the wood of the tree and after a while you have nothing but a mere shell, and so this thing that deceives people, this vigorous new growth in the little branches that are forced out from the latent buds is a screen to hide the ravages of disease in the wound.<query> what is the result of decay</query> But even if it didn't cause the destruction of the trees through disease and decay I cannot imagine why anybody can see beauty in a tree that is beheaded. I wonder sometimes what has become of men's sense of beauty. I heard a story from a member of Congress that interested me very much. I want to tell it to you now because I think it is more or less apropos to this band of tree butchers that we find in America. I had related in one of my talks in the House this little story about the buckeye tree, and after I sat down a member of the House from Florida came over and sat down beside me and told me that he wanted to relate an experience that he had the preceding summer. Now this gentleman was an old, white haired man, one of the most portly gentlemen that I have ever met, a man perhaps in the late sixties with wonderful poise and self control.<query> why was the buckeye tree beheaded</query> I have never seen him excited, and I have never seen him over enthuse. He related his little story somewhat like this, he said: ""When I was young and our first and only son was born my mother proposed that we plant a magnolia tree in the front yard in his honor. Being young and more or less irresponsible I laughed at the idea, but she persisted, so we planted a magnolia tree. ""The first time it bloomed was when he was graduated from high school; the next time it bloomed was when his sister was graduated. Then several years passed. The boy went away to war. In the war he contracted an incurable disease. He came back and lingered for a while, and finally passed away. ""Last summer they were going to widen the street in front of my house, and probably cut down that magnolia tree, so I went to see the city engineer.<query> when did the magnolia tree bloom</query> I said to him, Sir, I understand that you are going to widen the street in front of my house. He said, 'yes, that is the plan.' I said, 'Sir, I understand you plan to cut down the magnolia tree in my front yard.' He said, 'Well I am afraid we will have to.' ' Well, Sir, I came to tell you I shall shoot the man who cuts that tree.' He said, 'Do you mean it?' I said, 'Sir, I mean it. ' The man who cuts that tree I shall shoot and kill him.' ' Well,' he said, 'it won't be cut. "" Sometimes I think that is about the kind of treatment that is necessary to stop this unending slaughter of America's trees.<query> who cut down the magnolia tree</query> A tree demands very little care and attention if it be done annually, but that it must have to develop properly. How to save our trees? That is the problem; to prevent them from dying; to keep them in good health, strong and beautiful; to keep them with us. Surely these are admirable endeavors and worthy of much thought and attention. I cannot emphasize enough the necessity of removing the old bark of the trees once every two years just before spring opens. This should be gathered carefully and burned. It is not only of the greatest benefit to the growth and appearance of the tree, but it also destroys thousands of insects, larva and pupa in them, which have their winter quarters under the loose pieces of bark, just getting ready for their destructive work as soon as spring opens.<query> how often should you cut down trees</query> I see it everywhere I go, tens of thousands of them absolutely slaughtered and ruined. So far as telephone and electric light men are concerned I will make the statement that not more than 15% or 20% of the cutting is necessary that is usually done to get all of the wire clearance that is reasonably necessary for those wires to go through. I know because we have done a reasonable amount of it and have secured clearance, ample clearance with only a moderate amount of cutting. We cleared the trees in my home town for the telephone company there and didn't cut a single limb bigger than your thumb and gave them ample clearance. I think it is the most damnable slaughter, the most useless sacrifice of beauty that I know of in America, and sometimes I think the only kind of treatment that will answer is the kind of treatment that the tree butchers mete out to trees.<query> how much cutting is necessary for a telephone</query> That may sound a little harsh and yet I want to say, gentlemen that these men who slaughter the trees of America in this way defy all the laws of our country and all the laws of decency. They know no law and no restraint, only the law of force. I had an experience down in my home town—the telephone company was proposing to stretch a new line along the main street where I live and it is a beautiful street—I didn't make it so—the main street, where I live, the foresight of men fifty or seventy-five years ago made my street beautiful, and I was afraid of what would happen, so I called up the manager of the telephone company and asked him what their program was. He said, ""Well, we will have to put the wires through."" I said, '''Does that mean cutting?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""No more than is necessary."" Well, I said, ""Now listen, don't you cut any of those trees on the street where I live."" He said, ""what do you mean'?"" I said, ""I want to be perfectly frank with you, I have got a gun in the house, and the first fellow who undertakes to cut those trees I am going to use the gun on him, I know how to use it and it is in first class condition."" He said, ""What<query> do you cut trees</query> do you mean?"" I said, ""I mean business."" Well, as a matter of fact the trees weren't cut. I know of a case down in Poland, Ohio where one determined man in that community by his own force kept the electric light company from despoiling the trees that were a century old and were the pride and the glory of that community, the trees that made the town worth living in. It seems to me that what we need is just a little more of the fighting spirit out of which America was born in order to protect the rights of the public. Speaking along that line makes me think of the story about the minister who was lecturing his congregation on the subject of heaven and hell—an old fashioned subject. They used to talk a good deal about it, some of our modern ministers lecture on sociology, and books and theatres, and so forth, it used to be that they talked about heaven and hell.<query> why was the fighting spirit of america born</query> Anyway this must have been an old fashioned sort of minister because he proceeded at some length to plead with his congregation about this subject of great importance. Finally after he had finished he said to them, ""Any of you who want to go to heaven, stand up."" They all stood up except one old fellow who was asleep. They sat down and he said, ""Any of you who want to go to hell, stand up."" The old fellow woke up just in time to hear the last part of it and he stood up and looked the minister straight in the eye. The minister looked at him and said, ""My good man do you know what you are standing up for?"" He said, ""I do not, but you and I seem to be the only ones for it."" Now, with your permission I would like to talk for just a little while about another subject which seems to me of great and far-reaching importance and that is the question of forest devastation.<query> who said stand up for me</query> I am interested in it tremendously because it seems to me that this question of forest is one of the things that project themselves farther into the future of our country than most of the things that we ordinarily concern ourselves with. I call you to witness that we have lived through every tariff law that was ever enacted whether it be a high tariff, or a low tariff, and we have lived through every tax bill, high or low, somehow we have lived through it, and we have lived through a lot of other laws, good and bad, but there are some things that no nation can live through and remain great and strong and one of those is the destruction of the great natural wealth that only God can make. I have reference particularly to the destruction of America's forest wealth. A hundred and fifty years ago America became a new nation and this land was endowed by the creator with a greater quantity probably of natural wealth than any nation in the history of the world, and we started in with a prodigal hand to spend it as fast as we could go.<query> what is the destruction of the forest</query> Those of our forefathers who landed in Virginia under Captain John Smith sent back word to the mother country that they had discovered a land of inexhaustible fertility, and so it seemed, but you can go into Virginia today and buy thousands of acres almost for a song because it has been robbed of its fertility, it lacks the power of producing things in sufficient quantity to pay for cultivation. As a matter of fact I see an increasing number of abandoned farms from the Atlantic Seaboard west. In my own county there are 400 abandoned farms and this section was settled less than 200 years ago. Those of our forefathers who landed on the coast of New England carne face to face with a wonderful covering of trees, trees everywhere and yet today the New England states have exhausted four fifths of their original lumber supply; half of their remaining supply is in the State of Maine that is largely pulp wood varieties.<query> where are abandoned farms</query> They already import 30% of their own consumption and will import more and more as time goes on. Even the great Empire State of New York that once was the greatest producer of lumber in the Union today produces only 10% of its own consumption. They produce 30 board feet per capita every year and use 300. Penn's Woods, Pennsylvania, named because of its wonderful covering of trees has so far exhausted its supply of timber that they produced today less than enough for the Pittsburgh district alone, about 20% of their own consumption. The great lake states where there was a wonderful supply of magnificent white pine—that is almost gone. The original supply was estimated to have been 350 billion board feet, and it is now reduced to 8 billion, and it will be all gone in perhaps ten or fifteen years.<query> what is the largest producer of lumber in the united states</query> The wonderful supply of yellow pine in the south Atlantic and Gulf States is four-fifths gone. So I might go on and tell you the story, step by step, but the last report of the United States Forest Service tells us that the entire eastern half of the United States will be stripped bare of its timber from a commercial standpoint within twenty-five years. Of course there will be many individual trees, but speaking commercially the eastern half of the United States faces a lumber shortage, or exhaustion. And also that same report says that the apparently inexhaustible supply in the far west will be all gone in thirty-five or forty years, according to the present rate of consumption because as each section is stripped of its timber it lays a heavier and heavier demand on the remaining sections. One of the men with our company—that is the Davey Tree Expert Company (incidentally I have to stay in business to make the money I spend in politics) one of the men with our company was working in Mississippi last winter.<query> when will the eastern half of the us be stripped of timber</query> He knew I was interested in this subject of conservation and he wrote to me about the conditions he found in the little town down there. He said the town had been built around the lumber industry and the whole supply was exhausted so the company had been bringing logs from the Pacific Coast by way of the Panama Canal, up through the Gulf of Mexico by rail so this little town in Mississippi could keep alive. That is not an isolated case; there are many many communities that have almost ceased to exist because of the exhaustion of the lumber supply. I was told last summer by a representative of the United States Forest Service that one-fifth of the timberland in the state of Michigan had gone back to the state for nonpayment of taxes. It is land good for nothing else except growing trees and the trees have been so entirely cut away, the land has no more value, and nobody wants it, so they dumped it back on the state for the rest of the people to carry the load.<query> why did the lumber industry stop</query> However, the question of lumber supply is only one phase of this far-reaching proposition. I sometimes wonder how we would carry on in our scheme of civilization if we ran out of lumber. Stop to think of all the things into which lumber enters and ask yourselves how we would maintain our scheme of civilization, our standard of living and progress, without lumber, and you have some idea of the magnitude of the problem. But that isn't all. I have in mind the terrible tragedy that we were reading about so much in the papers this Last spring when the flood waters were sweeping down through the Mississippi Valley. I am thoroughly convinced that the more serious aspects of that flood were due to the destruction of the trees around the headwaters of the streams that makeup the Mississippi. It wasn't the water that fell down into the Mississippi Valley, it was the water that fell in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Indiana and Kentucky and Illinois, Wisconsin, Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa—all that great section where the trees have been cut away and the water sweeps quickly into the little streams and it pours rapidly into the larger streams and finally into the Father of Waters.<query> why did the mississippi flood happen</query> ""One ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure"" and the removal of the old bark is just such an ounce of prevention against the ravages of caterpillars and scale in summer. PRUNING I was taught some years ago by our local nurserymen, to do all tree pruning when the trees were dormant, or when the sap was down; but from my own experience, and observation of late years, I do all my pruning when the sap is up and I recommend same to all my friends. In our own locality, the center of Ohio, I find the month of June and usually the first two weeks of July (if the weather conditions are right) is the best season of year to do this work. One should always use a sharp, fine-tooth saw, and as soon as the trees are pruned paint the cuts with one coat of thin paint.<query> when to prune trees in ohio</query> And so the channel was just too small, it couldn't hold it, and we had a flood, and we will have more and more floods as the destruction continues because nature made the trees, the forest trees as a reservoir to hold the water back and let it seep out gradually. Go out sometime into the woods and see the condition that the creator made. Look down at the wonderful soil, loose, porous, soil it is and take up a handful of it and see the provision that was made to absorb the moisture and then watch the water in imagination as it comes down from the heavens through the leaves and settles into this loose porous soil and follow it further, in imagination as it travels by underground channels to the little springs, and see how those springs feed the little streams, and they in turn feed the rivers, and thus you have a continuity of water supply.<query> why did nature make the trees</query> But when man comes along in his breathless haste to get rich quick, or for some other reason and he cuts the trees away, allows the land to be burned over. When the rain descends from the heavens it sweeps across the surface of the land and takes with it the precious topsoil, precious top soil. It is said by scientists that it takes nature ten thousand years to make one inch of fertile top soil by the process of decaying vegetation, piling one little particle upon another—ten thousand years, and oh so little time to wash it away. I stood by the Potomac River in Washington some two or three years ago when that stream was on the rampage and like all flood waters that stream was also muddy, and I thought to myself: what part of my country is making this terrible contribution to the sea?<query> how long does it take for topsoil to form</query> And then after the flood waters had subsided I went into Potomac Park again and there on the grass I saw an inch or two of precious top soil deposited there by the mad rushing waters, but only a little fraction of the enormous quantity that had been carried down to the ocean. Reading in one of the News Weekly Magazines this last spring about the flood in the Mississippi I came across one paragraph that struck me with great force. It told how fishermen were coming back from the Gulf of Mexico and describing the condition of the water. It said that the Gulf Stream was actually becoming discolored by the prodigious quantity of soil carried down by this flood. It also told how great schools of fishes were coming far out into the Gulf in order to escape suffocation. This question of the washing away of the precious topsoil it seems to me is one of the very serious aspects of our forest devastation policy, but that is only one side of it.<query> what was the effect of the gulf stream flood</query> There is also the question of adequate water supply. Our capital city, Columbus, Ohio several years ago was face to face with a water famine, the situation was so bad that they held prayer meetings calling upon God Almighty to save them from the threatened catastrophe—that is our human system, we do everything wrong then when we get into trouble we call upon God to pull us out of the hole. Anyway they had their prayer meetings and whether God answered their prayers we don't know, but a providential rain did come and averted this terrible catastrophe. Can you imagine anything more serious than a city of 300,000 people without water? Columbus secures its municipal supply from the Sciota River and that stream is all but dried up all because the trees and the vegetation had been cut away from its head waters, and so sometimes you have too much water and that causes a flood and then you have too little water at other times, and that causes a drought.<query> why is columbus ohio without water</query> That is a part of the penalty that man must pay for his folly and for his destruction. There is another aspect to it that is both interesting and important. Scientists tell us that one tree in an average growing season throws into the air about five hundred barrels of water through its leaves by the process called transpiration. Just as our breath is laden with moisture so there is thrown out through the leaves great quantities of moisture in vapor form to remain in the air to be condensed and come back as rainfall. Then it is taken up again by vegetation and again it is thrown out in vapor form to be condensed once more and thrown out as rainfall. So you have the constant supply of water for all forms of life. . You probably have heard the old saying about the sun drawing water, referring to evaporation.<query> how much water is thrown out of trees</query> Science tells us there is infinitely more water thrown into the air through the leaves of vegetation than from all the evaporation and all the rivers and lakes in the ocean. It is a constant supply of moisture into the air by the process of transpiration through the leaves. Speaking about conservation—I heard a story about a Scotchman that may interest you. I have a suspicion that maybe there are some Scotchmen here. Well, you know they have a reputation for being rather thrifty. I don't know whether it is true or not. Anyway this particular Scotchman was sitting in a hotel lobby feeling pretty blue and looking as though he were beyond the power of consolation. A stranger came by and asked him what the trouble was and Sandy said, ""I am on my Honeymoon and I couldn’t afford to bring my wife."" Now I want to refer, in closing, to two other things, first to the tragic example of China because we have in the example of China ample evidence of' what may happen to America and a proper indication of what we ought to do.<query> why is it important to conserve water</query> China once had a wonderful covering of trees, very much like our own, perhaps not as fine and still a very wonderful covering and China did with her trees just exactly as we are doing with ours. She cut them away, allowed her land to be burned over and then the floods came and swept away her precious topsoil. China has become a land of perpetual famine. They only have one crop in seven years. In the other years of that period they must look to the world for food. One of my brothers took a trip around the world some three or four years ago and he was interested in the subject just the same as I and when he returned he told me of his observations. He described how when they came up through the Yellow Sea he was impressed by the increasing chocolate color of the water and he wondered what its significance was.<query> why is china a land of perpetual famine</query> Then when they went out across the land and saw those miles and miles of barren land, he began to understand. He told me that he saw men and women and children out gathering weed stalks by the roadside with which to cook their rice, they had no wood for fuel, not even bushes, just weeds. There are millions of acres of land in China where nothing grows at all, not even weeds, then there are other millions and millions of acres where nothing much more than weeds can grow, and so they have a land stripped of its fertility in large part with an enormous population, and I am afraid that the case of China is hopeless. I wish that my country might profit by that example because no land in the history of the world ever survived the destruction of its great natural wealth.<query> where does weed grow in china</query> That land where Christ was born today supports only 10% of the population that it did 1900 years ago, because the land has been robbed of its fertility and fewer and fewer people can live there. Meanwhile the population of the world is increasing. This question of preserving the fertility of the soil so that it may grow food for man and animals and all forms of life I think is one of the great problems of this and future generations. I am interested in this question because it affects my country. Possibly you and I may not see the severe consequences of our national folly, we may be dead and gone before its worst phases appear, but even so we have a very great responsibility for the safekeeping of this great heritage. Our America—we sing of it in song, we glorify it in our literature, but what is America?<query> why is the soil important to the survival of life</query> Is it land? Is it rivers and lakes or mountains? No. That isn't America, because this land was here many years ago and the same mighty rivers were flowing to the sea, long before civilization began and the same majestic mountains lifted their lofty summits to the skies before man was, and even the same stars twinkled in the nighttime before there was any life upon this globe. No—America is a great human thing, a great new system, and philosophy of government. America is people and those things which affect people are the things of supreme and lasting importance. Nothing is of greater significance than the destruction of the basic wealth upon which people exist. I am tempted to relate to you the little story of my good old father, because it was from him that I received my first inspiration in the cause of conservation, from his lips years ago I heard the story.<query> what is the difference between america and the world</query> Never leave any stubs when pruning, but cut always just as close as possible to the trunk of the tree, so that the cambium gets a chance to close the wound, and the sap must be up in the tree in order to promote this growth. Cambium is the white and softer part of wood between the inner bark and the wood. It is popularly called the sap-wood. This is annually acquiring firmness and thus becoming hard wood. If a limb is cut when the sap is down, and has to stand several months, before the sap rises up again this cut becomes hard and dry, and in most cases the cambium never starts to grow and in a few years the cut is rotten and makes a home for insects and we all know that where we have insects we cannot have a healthy tree.<query> what is the cambium</query> He was born in, England at a time when there were no public schools, and he was twenty-one before he knew his ABC’s. That is almost inconceivable to us in this country where education is free, but it was the general rule then in England because only the children of the aristocracy had the advantages of education. So he started in as a full grown young man to learn to read by the slow painful process of self-education. He began with a little copy of the New Testament and a little dictionary, picking out one word at a time until he finally acquired a grammar so that he might learn to put the words together properly. He showed me one time not very long before he passed away the old faded copy of the New Testament from which he learned to read and on it there was a brown spot where a drop of milk had fallen as he studied while he milked in the long ago.<query> when was edgar robertson born</query> Then, like millions of other sturdy sons of Europe he heard the call of America, this great land of freedom and opportunity, and he came here to work out his destiny. He pursued his education still further studying by night and working by day until he finally acquired an education that would have done credit to the average college graduate, and I sometimes think a more profound education. But one of the things that impressed me most about him was the fad that he became one of the really fine Americans that it has been my privilege to know. He learned every word of our Constitution, every word of it. He learned every word of every verse of America and every word of the Star Spangled Banner, and until old age laid its heavy hand upon him he could sing those songs with a zeal and a fervor that were good to see.<query> what was the most important thing that john f. kennedy learned about He became a full citizen under our law at the first opportunity, and he told me of that sacred day when he raised his right hand and foreswore allegiance to the British Crown and swore allegiance to the flag of America, and his eyes filled with tears as he described that most sacred day of his life. I saw him from the time I was a little fellow, and long before I could comprehend the significance of it, every time he passed by Old Glory he tipped his hat in veneration. I think perhaps there is something in that story for you and for me, for those of us who were born here, those of us who were privileged to come here by choice to make this a home because this great wonderful America, this new nation is a rich heritage, America is only a hundred and fifty years old, that is only two normal life times.<query> who tipped his hat in veneration</query> It seems quite a while to talk about a hundred and fifty years, but just a little while ago we were reading about King Tut who reigned in Egypt thirty-five hundred years ago, and as we look back across the long span of time we begin to realize how very young America is, because in that period of thirty-five hundred years we can see countless nations rise and fall, kingdoms and principalities and powers almost without number come and go and then we realize how very young America is and when we take an inventory of our situation we realize how far we have gone on the road of destruction. We have spent the principal of our inheritance faster than any people that ever lived, and some day we shall pay a tragic price. America is ours only for safekeeping, we do not own it.<query> how long has america been in power</query> Oh I know the land stands in our names at the court houses, if we own it, but we only have it so long as we may live, and then according to the laws of nature we must pass it on to other generations that are yet to come. This country, great and wonderful as it .is came into our keeping as stewards to use and to enjoy for a little while, and then we must pass it on and when we received our America with all of its matchless and manifold blessings we received also a great and everlasting responsibility to keep our America as great and as wonderful and as worthwhile as it was when we received it.

The sunlight and air should reach every part of the tree. Do not prune simply because you see your neighbor pruning, but start about your work with the aim of accomplishing a certain fixed purpose, and never cut a branch from your tree unless you have a reason for so doing. The tree may be spread, or it may be contracted, by cutting to a bud that point outward for the former or to a bud that inclines inward for the later. If this be done intelligently it will prove of great value in the training of your trees. As a rule, the weaker the growth the harder it should be pruned back.<query> when to prune a tree</query> This will encourage a heavier wood growth the following season. By this article it can be seen that growing fine trees is not a sinecure, but still it is a glorious work, demanding a man's whole energy and unfailing love for Nature, and one of her most beautiful creations--the tree.

C. Simonds Graceland Cemetery, Chicago, IIlinois Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 39th Annual Convention Of all the characteristics of a cemetery, which is the most desirable? A cemetery should first of all be comforting. This means that it must be beautiful, restful, secluded. To attain these characteristics it must include within its boundary much of nature. What is nature? In its broadest significance it includes almost the universe. Some persons use this term as if it were synonymous with the Deity, saying, Nature does this, nature does that, nature's laws are the laws of God.<query> what is the characteristic of a cemetery</query> Although we sometimes speak of inanimate nature, it is often personified. Often we hear the expression ""Mother Earth"", perhaps less frequently nature is referred to as ""mother"". Mother most endearing of all words. The poet says: “Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind."" She is represented as soothing and comforting and especially as healing the mind, the part that is in greatest need of healing when a dear friend is left to the permanent care of a cemetery. Nature, therefore, is the most important feature to have in mind in designing a cemetery. For the purpose of this paper, nature will be considered as that manifestation of the out of doors that is independent of man. We find it in its most attractive and familiar shape in the woods, the borders of lakes and rivers, the hills and valleys, ravines and sky and in the clouds.<query> what is nature's meaning</query> Nature has infinite variety. When we detect the work of man, as in an orchard, a field of corn; or a row of trees along an avenue, we cease to think of what we see as the work of nature, out rather look at it as man's creation. We see nature when we look at the wooded margin of an open field with its skyline of oaks, its thicket of wild crab apples blooming in the full sun, its viburnums and elderberries. We see her along the rights of way of railroads as we journey from one place to another. In spring or early summer, when we look from a car window, we are greeted with large beds of iris, lupines, shooting stars, spiderworts, butterfly weeds, black-eyed susans, ferns, or a little later, with the flowers or Joe Pye Wood, wild roses, lilies, cardinal flowers, goldenrod, asters and hundreds of others of nature's planting.<query> what is nature's work</query> If the train passes through woods, we may see here and there, as we look from the car window, masses of sassafras, filled with yellow flowers in spring, rich with foliage throughout the summer and gloriously colored with yellows and reds in autumn. We may also see oaks, maples, hawthorns, dogwoods, elderberries, prairie roses, wild grapes clematis, bittersweet and a host of other woody plants all beautiful and all helping to give what we call ""the charm of nature."" What is this charm which we feel when we go to the woods, when we go to pine forests, when we so to uncultivated prairies which glow with wild sunflowers, asters and goldenrod and when we wander along the wooded banks of lakes and rivers and through wooded ravines? It is difficult to analyze and define, hut it is due to nature's perfect freedom, to beauty of outline and color, to deep shadows and bright lights, to many things being hidden by foliage or inequalities of ground, to the air of mystery that pervades things in which man has no hand.<query> what is the charm of nature</query> It is this charm of nature which we should try to introduce into cemeteries. It is this that makes her ""consoling and kind"". Many cemeteries do not have this charm. Often one sees from the train cemeteries fully exposed to view on all sides and containing only monuments, headstones and a few forlorn trees. Even some pretentious cemeteries with very costly monuments and perfectly kept lawns lack this charm which soothes and comforts. Are there any cemeteries in which this comforting characteristic can be found? Mr. Strauch introduced it into Spring Grove Cemetery in the naturalistic /borders of the lakes and in the preservation of the wooded ravines. Recently a cemetery has been established on Long Island which bids fair to contain the charm of which I speak. This cemetery, designed by the Olmsteds, is to have no stonework above the ground.<query> what is the charm of a cemetery</query> A family name may appear on a stone tablet set even with the turf. There is a plentiful supply of shrubbery to separate one lot from another. When nature has had time to correct the inevitable imperfections and rawness of new plantings, this may become one of her most charming retreats. Many cemeteries contain touches of the charm of nature, but I know of none really perfect. It is true that people's tastes differ and we have different points of view. One telephone man said that to his eye a line of straight telephone poles on each side of a road with arms carrying a plentiful supply of wires was the most beautiful decoration a thoroughfare could have, but I think even he would have hesitated about putting such a decoration in a cemetery. These opinions, however, are evidently somewhat biased. A lover of nature has nothing to sell, no ax to grind.<query> what is the most beautiful decoration in a cemetery</query> He is merely anxious to have people enjoy with him the beauty that he sees. The appreciation of this beauty is something that must be cultivated in order to be fully enjoyed. Some do not even see a sunset until their attention is called to it. Some see no beauty in winter, while others experience great enjoyment at that season in the branching of trees, the twiggery of shrubs, the snow and the glistening ice-covered branches. There are two or three things which seem desirable in order to secure that beauty of nature which is so comforting. The first is to reduce the amount of stonework either by planting out most of the monuments and headstones, or by reducing them to inconspicuous dimensions. Some of the money that is spent for monuments should be spent in securing more land so that there will be room for shrubs and flowers.<query> what is the best way to preserve the beauty of nature</query> We should appreciate the fact that while a perfect lawn is most desirable in some places, there are other places where the ground cover should include other things. Where height is not objectionable, lilacs will often spread out and make a beautiful ground cover when left undisturbed. The same is true of many other shrubs. Where land is poor and sandy perhaps nothing in the shrub line is better for a ground cover than the aromatic sumach, which is beautiful at all seasons, and especially attractive in the fall with its rich coloring. For a still low covering, there are many vines that are suitable. In the deep Shade of woods the Virginia creeper often makes a beautiful cover, hiding the entire ground with a layer of leaves of a delightful green in summer and often richly colored in autumn. Wild violets, myrtle, Japanese spurge, moneywort, ground ivy and carpet bugle are a few of the many beautiful ground covering plants.<query> what plants are good ground coverings</query> In a neglected country cemetery a large area became covered with cypress spurge. This is a beautiful little Euphorbia and while it is often called a weed, it was the most attractive thing in the cemetery being green arid fresh-looking while the grass everywhere else was brown. The neighboring farmer called it cemetery grass and the first question he asked was how to get rid of it. Often, too many so-called bedding plants are used in a cemetery. These bring in revenue and are showy in summer, but they leave the ground bare from October until May. To bring in the charm of nature we should use more hardy perennials. These often beautify waste places in a most satisfactory way. They are on hand from early in the spring until snow comes and even their dead stems and seed vessels are often graceful and beautiful throughout the winter.<query> what plants are used in a cemetery</query> Many city dwellers are in the habit of going to northern Wisconsin or northern Michigan for rest and recreation during the summer. Some of these have asked ""Why can't I have my cemetery lot like the northern woods which I love 80 much?"" These persons certainly feel the charm of nature and would like to have this charm about their final resting place. The longer we live and the more we observe, the more shall we be convinced of the truth of that oft-repeated saying, ""Nature is the best teacher"". The superintendent who can introduce foliage and flowers as nature uses them everywhere in covering waste places, creating forests, developing secluded beauty spots and doing all this while concealing his own part in the work will be the most successful in the development of a really worthy cemetery. In a cemetery well endowed with the charms of nature, one cannot see from end to end and from side to side and on beyond to surrounding buildings or farms.<query> why can't i have my cemetery lot like the northern woods</query> From every point there will be views, some wide, some narrow, and these will be bounded at the sides and terminated by foliage. The side boundaries will not be straight but will recede here and there into bays, tempting one on to see into their depths. Against the foliage will be seen, from time to time, quantities of flowers, wild crab apple blossoms, lilacs, flowers of hawthorn, forsythia and a hundred others. Here and there at the base of the foliage there may at times be the blossoms of iris, peonies, goldenrod, coreopsis and other flowers too numerous to mention or if it is in the fall, there will be attractive fruits, foliage and the blossoms of witch hazel. If there is a hill or ridge, it will be masked at the top with the foliage of trees reaching from the ground to the skyline so that one can easily imagine in looking at the upward slope that it extends on indefinitely to a great height.<query> what is the foliage of a tree</query> If there is a valley, the views into its depths will be preserved. There will be extended openings showing at the bottom a green turf or the foliage of low growing plants like moneywort, myrtle or partridge berry, or perhaps, there will be a stream or lake or little pools reflecting the sky and forming jewels in the landscape. If there is a good view outside of the cemetery to a distant hill, lake or river, or to a sunset, this view will, of course, be preserved. In such a cemetery the stone monuments will be inconspicuous, but the cemetery as a whole will be a memorial park, a fitting monument for all buried within its enclosure where ""Nature forever consoling and kind; pours her wine and her oil on the smarts of the mind.""

Plumb Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention Mankind is living today in the Air Age.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> We turn the switch of the radio and out of the air comes reports of the days news from cities miles away. Lives are saved by the S. O. S. sent out from ships in distress. Our mails are being carried day and night over a vast net work of airways and the air has become the highway of travel between all countries and all people. We not only breathe the air for the very existence of life itself but in countless other ways are we dependent upon air in this modern age. Nothing is more universally distributed over the earth's surface and it is as free to the scientist as it is to plants and animals. Air is composed of the four common elements: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, but nitrogen is in the greatest abundance. Plants and animals are composed of the same four elements and nitrogen is the plant food required in the largest quantities.<query> why do we breathe air</query> As man's dependence for food is almost entirely on plant growth it is of great importance that our supply of nitrogen be increased to take care of the ever increasing population of the world. It is estimated that the air over every square mile of land contains twenty million tons of nitrogen or thirty thousand tons over every acre. Mother Nature with unusual impartiality has distributed nitrogen to every country in proportion to its area. The problem of the Scientist was how to extract this nitrogen from the air and make it available as a plant food. It was known for ages that lightning fixes or converts some of the nitrogen into a chemical compound which the rain and the snow carries into the ground where the plant roots can absorb it. It was known that clovers and other leguminous crops took some of the nitrogen from the air, but all of these processes are slow and the Scientist struggled for centuries to find the secret of extracting some of this abundant nitrogen from the air so that it could be used for the good of mankind.<query> how much nitrogen is in the air</query> The new concentrates contain no weed seeds or waste material. Their application is easy and pleasant, the labor cost is reduced arid the exact amount necessary for each plants requirements can be supplied and all guesswork eliminated. So literally, ""OUT OF THE AIR"" has come our most necessary plant food. As the population increased the area of fertility must be expanded. The day is coming when one acre must produce as much as two does now. We must adapt ourselves to these new methods and prepare for even greater discoveries which will improve the fertility of our soils.

Moore Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 44th Annual Convention I chose the subject, ""The Influence of Landscape Gardening on International Relationship"" because landscape gardening is a work in which you are vitally interested and because no phase of human endeavor yields more attractive results nor appeals more to the finer susceptibilities of the human heart.<query> when was the aacs conference</query> The apparent result of the practice is the transformation of unsightly places in all communities of note, into spots upon which the eye delights to rest. Cemeteries today—these sacred spots, the laying out of which it is your duty to superintend—are no longer called places of the dead, places shunned by the public, but have become through your zeal gardens of living beauty—a tribute to the intelligence of man and a sign that civilization is advancing. It should not be assumed that a beautifully laid out and planted cemetery or a beautiful park, are assets only to the community in which located. The influence of beautifully landscaped areas extends far beyond their own environs. The passing tourist notes them; he speaks about them. They thus become an example to be emulated. Many towns and cities are known throughout the length and breadth of North America by reason of their beautiful parks and cemeteries.<query> why are cemeteries important</query> In the hearts of all civilized people is a love for the Beautiful things of the Creation—flowers and trees and shrubs—and so, in life, as if drawn by an invisible magnet, we find ourselves attracted to these places of beauty and in the end we have so ordained that when the soul hath left its tenement our bodies shall repose unforgotten in areas where each succeeding year the opening buds and leaves and flowers proclaim ""There is no Death"". Such, Mr. President and members of the American Association of Cemetery Superintendents, is your work and mission. You build a rampart of living beauty around the places where our dust shall lie and which, as a result, are no longer referred to as ""places of the dead."" You hold this convention in Canada because you are attracted; you are interested in our cemeteries and parks and by the beauty of our home surroundings and landscapes.<query> what is the purpose of the american association of cemetery superintendents</query> Millions of your people visit Canada for the same reason, and I may add, because you like us, and Canada is rapidly becoming the summer playground of North America. Thus the work of man in his efforts to supplement nature in planting to hide the unsightly and to enhance the already beautiful is having a great effect in bringing together our peoples and in strengthening and cementing the bonds of good-will and friendship which for more than a century have been the talk and wonder of the world. You may be surprised to know that in Ontario, of which Toronto is the capital city, there is an organization known as the Ontario Horticultural Association which has a membership of 80,000 and comprises 285 societies. (It is purely amateur and is the largest of its kind. As you drive along the roads and through the municipalities you observe the gardens, the plantings of shrubs, the flowers of all kinds.<query> what is the largest horticultural association in canada</query> To this organization should largely, go the credit for this desirable condition. Our people are influenced by a desire to have beautiful homes and also that the sight of them should give pleasure to visitors from the states. They are interested in them. They desire their friendship rather than their money, and they find that the influence of the beauty they have created coupled with the beauty of park and cemetery and street within our municipalities is doing more to bring about a closer feeling of friendship than any other single factor. Through this attraction the people of the United States and Canada are getting together in a way previously undreamed of and as a result a full and proper understanding will inevitably accrue. It has been claimed that good roads are the attraction. No, not solely. Were these roads to run hundreds of miles through a wilderness, through a desert, they would be deserted except by the adventurer.<query> why are the people of the united states and canada attracted to each other</query> Good roads are but one factor. There are two others—beauty and friendship—and of the latter, the most important, we offer you good measure, pressed down and running over. By reason of this understanding, this closer friendship, your country and mine, two great English speaking nations, have found a common ground upon which can be expressed this great love and regard for each other in a way that will be the admiration and envy of the world. We are going to establish the world's most beautiful peace memorial at a point upon our border—an International Peace Garden. In this great garden, one half in the United States, the other in Canada, the landscape architects craft will find its greatest expression, and the influence of the resultant beauty coupled with its great sentiment, will be such as to draw all peoples—and it will become the world's greatest shrine.<query> where is the peace garden</query> What will the influence of this garden be on international relationships? Within its vast area will be trees and shrubs and flowers from all parts of the earth, Gardens beautifully landscaped to represent the national style of various countries, The governments of both countries will be asked to neutralize the area and to it will come the people of the hundred nations which compose the population of the United States and Canada and people from overseas and from the Latin countries to the south and all will be citizens of this great and beautiful area. Nothing can be so beautiful as a garden, nothing more attractive, and it will belong to the people themselves, and the names of all subscribers will be kept for the eyes of future generations to scan; the adults in one set of volumes, the children in another, for all are to be given an opportunity to subscribe to raise the endowment of five million dollars.<query> what will the influence of this garden be on international relations?</query> Nothing appeals to the human heart more than beauty. This garden will be not merely a beautiful expression of the love of each nation for the other, but a living and enduring one. It will not crumble nor decay like a shaft of granite. The dust of centuries shall not bury it. Each circling spring will see it renewed as a mountain stream is renewed in power and beauty, and a thousand years hence it will, in its majestic grandeur, still be the greatest symbol of international friendship and goodwill. The first International Peace Garden will be the world's strongest fortress, stronger than loop holed battlement or dugout of concrete and steel, for these cannot, stand the brunt of modern warfare. It will be the fortress of friendship built upon the rock of Christianity as expressed through the love of each nation; and in its shadow we may each forever crest secure.<query> what is the international peace garden</query> In friendship alone is there security, is there real happiness. Your act in coming to Canada is an act of friendship. Last year to this city came the National Association of Gardeners. That was an act of friendship. They have the same ideals and aims and are engaged in the same great work. They sponsor the International Peace Garden project. I wonder if you realize how much your lives and work influence the thoughts of the masses toward life's better things. Your work is not a job; it is an influence. The burial of the dead is a job. The beautification of God's acre is an influence. The poet says: ""Tis all a checkerboard of nights and days Where destiny with men for pieces plays, Hither and thither moves and mates and slays And one by one back in the closet lays"".<query> what is the meaning of the poem tis all a checkerboard of nights and But that is not true. The influence of a life is not lost for it pertains to the soul. Your great national organization exerts an influence. It is devoted to the beautification not only of your cemeteries but of your country. You convene today to discuss your problems, to tell each other of the things you have accomplished and of the things projected and so your influence extends more rapidly than otherwise and will continue until it reaches from coast to coast and to result in a blessing to every community. This influence is not only a national influence but an international one. The standards you set in the laying out and maintaining of your cemeteries are emulated by Canada. Your cemetery practices are very advanced. You have made a special study of the problems pertaining thereto. So in this respect we learn something from you.<query> what is the influence of a life</query> In certain other fields you learn from us which goes to prove that friendly international intercourse is a great medium of education as well as being the greatest factor in the maintenance of goodwill and understanding between nations. Men, and women who think only of their own immediate interests, and there are millions, lack vision. Their souls never find expression and are stifled. Men and women who think nationally have a broader, yet not the broadest, outlook. They who think internationally think of all men. To think internationally is to think like God. You and I in our own way and through the instrumentality of our chosen and common profession are today together. Americans and Canadians bound by the ties of relationship, in, that we speak a common language and in that our traditions, honorable in the extreme can be traced back to a common ancestry, and you are not ashamed of the old mother that gave you birth.<query> who thinks internationally</query> I am speaking now of your nation. We call you cousins but let me say that when the International Peace Garden is established, as it surely will, and when the international line is removed from its centre and when our governments neutralize it, we will be able to call you brothers and sisters, for all who visit this great neutral area, peoples of all nations of the world, will be citizens of that land. Today, according to our laws, you are aliens and foreigners. Recently I visited the United States and I belonged to the foreign class, but I see the day approaching when by reason of our getting together through the building of our great Fortress of Friendship, the Peace Garden, the word ""alien"" will be removed from the statute books of both countries and as long as Americans and Canadians are law-abiding it will not matter under which flag they sojourn.<query> when is the peace garden established</query> In conclusion will you permit me to say, and in this may there be inspiration. Your work is immortal, if anything on earth is immortal. If the painted canvas shall be treasured and so endure so shall those beauty spots you create be preserved and treasured. The results of your work are like the friendships you make today. Time shall not efface them; a century hence their verdure shall be as green, the trees as beautiful, and the ties of friendship the stronger, for such things are handed down from generation to generation. Beauty, friendship and love are all akin and in and through and round about them is God—and so they shall endure. In that great spirit of everlasting friendship Canada welcomes you. A spirit that will not tolerate any cloud to darken the international horizon; a spirit that long ago leveled the mountains of prejudice and has done so much to bring about such meetings as these where international friendships find their greatest expression and are cemented in indissoluble bonds.<query> what is the meaning of the painting friendship</query> In the Spirit of God—inspired friendship—which is the spirit of Canada and of the Peace Garden, you are welcomed. One day your people and ours and all peoples will throng the portals of a magnificent garden. Eyes will feast upon its beauty and be illumined with a new light. Hearts will be uplifted with a new hope and songs will rise to tongues which never sang. Children will join the chorus and the whole world will become akin. On that day will come the realization that the two great English speaking nations have set up an unparalleled and unprecedented example of love to the world. With it will also comes the realization that the hope of peace on earth and goodwill between nations as exemplified by ours, may forever endure. Hope that hellish war may forever be banished. So will the men and women who love beauty and the boys and girls born of these with the wisdom of years and the towering faith and vision of youth remove the mountains of hatred, of prejudice, and of envy and build an insurmountable barrier in the way of those who foment war—a barrier of love and create and leave to the world its most beautiful and significant memorial.<query> what is the spirit of the peace garden</query> Can the members of any organization have a greater influence than that? Is any work more conducive to friendly international relationship than yours? ""There is no death—what seems so is transition"". May this address be vibrant with life. May it convey the thought that good work well done, the beautiful thing created, will never be laid aside, but will continue through the years an example to those who follow and as a memorial to the integrity of those of your profession who went before. Now may I welcome you from the depth of my own in the words of an original poem! A LAND WITHOUT A LINE You came to the land of the Maple Leaf And we met you with a smile, We took your hands in a friendly grasp And hoped you'd stay a while. Though you live 'neath the Stars and Stripes And we 'neath the Union Jack, We speak the same old mother tongue— Uncle Sam and Jack Canuck.<query> who said there is no death—what seems so is transition</query> Between us runs three thousand miles, A line from coast to coast, Where never a fort and never a gun Is seen, we proudly boast. No bayonet with its murderous steel, No sentry anywhere, And we live in peace on either side As though no line were there. Side by side for a hundred years, May it be a thousand more! With never a word to cause us grief Nor any to make us sore. We have lived, and still the Union Jack And stars and Stripes unfurled Have flown together on the line The wonder of the world. Please God, till earth's last sun shall set And earth's last tear be shed, May we two nations still be friends When to heaven Thou call’st Thy dead.<query> where is the union jack</query> Until on that eternal morn As its glorious sun shall shine, Thy nations meet around Thy throne In a land without a line.

Let us take a burial ground conducted strictly upon the lawn system, say for instance, Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, where every surrounding indicates quietness and repose; the beautifully kept lawns, or open spaces surrounded by, or dotted with trees and shrubs bearing foliage of different hues, and shades of green. Each of these lawns or spaces are beautiful pictures in themselves, the trees being planted to throw light and shade on the sward heightens the beauty of the picture, and the effect upon the spectator is soothing and commands silent admiration. The very somberness of the surroundings indicates repose, and the mind immediately associates itself with the idea of the suitability of the cemetery as a final resting place. Beds planted with brightly colored flowers upon such lawns would be extremely out of harmony with the surroundings, and would not be desirable.<query> what is the meaning of flowers in a cemetery</query> Flower planting, no matter how artistically the work is done, is palpably artificial, and in the majority of cemeteries, out of place. A modern cemetery should appear as natural as possible. Imagine a nicely graded section adorned with trees and shrubs; the landscape artist has expended his energies in making it appear as perfectly natural as possible. A lot owner, whose portion is probably in the most prominent part, conceives the idea of having bed upon, or a border around his lot; the graves are also adorned with plants until the lot has the appearance of what a brother superintendent justly describes as a crazy patch-work quilt. No doubt the work is artistic, it does not harmonize with the surroundings, and to the trained eye of a landscape gardener the effect is harsh in the extreme. Lot owners, as a rule, care nothing for the harmonious appearance of the whole.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> To the individual lot is what they desire to call attention. One great aim of a cemetery superintendent should be to educate the people to the fact that ""in simplicity there is beauty;"" that a cemetery should look natural and park-like, and that the general appearance of the whole should be studied, rather than any particular spot. A stupendous task, more especially, in localities where the residents migrated from parts where the modern cemetery system is unknown. To their minds the old country churchyard, with its heterogeneous mass of flowers and vegetation is beautiful, and exactly what a burial ground should be. A few days ago the writer counted no less than 34 plants of different varieties, including mint upon a four-foot grave. Nothing can persuade the owner that it is not the most beautiful grave in the cemetery.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery superintendent</query> To prevent this class of ornamentation will require stringent rules, the enforcement of which means unpopularity, and few officials care to have their cemeteries unpopular. Several who have tried arbitrary rules in this direction have had to modify them in obedience to public feeling. There are many first class cemeteries where flower planting is extensively practiced, these are now being styled “flower garden cemeteries”. The question of the desirability of flower planting is settled as far as they are concerned. There are also burial grounds where flower planting would prove an improvement, but these places can scarcely be classed among the lawn cemeteries. They are simply grave yards, no great amount of landscape work having been lavished on their construction, and the management “a sort of go-as-you-please”. Then again, there is the dollars and cents side of the question.<query> what is flower planting in cemeteries</query> In the majority of cemeteries, both large and small, the desire to make money is paramount, and what should be has to give way to the mighty dollar. So few can afford to sacrifice cash to sentiment, and as most cemeteries are conducted for the money there is in them, flower planting will be encouraged. It is business, simply business. Where flower planting is considered desirable, study should be given to the use, as much as possible, of dwarf growing plants and such as bear flowers, quiet in color, for in few instances do the brighter colors harmonize with the surroundings of a burial ground. For cemetery work nothing looks worse than a bed containing a mixture of tall growing plants, such as dahlias, lilies, salvia, chrysanthemums, hollyhocks and others too numerous to enumerate. Pretty effects can be obtained with dwarf growing plants, especially when massed, and they are not so visible from a distance, therefore their appearance is not so striking, nor is the appearance of the lawn so broken as by their taller brethren.<query> what kind of plants are grown in cemeteries</query> For many years I purchased seed from specialists and had a failure each time, then I purchased strong plants which flowered well and in a hot season produced abundance of seeds which I had sown immediately it was ripe, under this treatment I produced thousands of plants. Bulbs. As the cultivation of hyacinths, snowdrops, scillas, crocus and similar spring bulbs is so well known I do not propose to offer any remarks on them. I trust this short paper has interested you as it is my earnest desire to do.

H. Hadley Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that I owe you a little bit of apology in appearing here with what comparatively little I have to show you.<query> what is a good shrub for planting</query> I had expected to show slides, which I always figure save me a lot of work because what the slides show I do not have to tell you, but unfortunately for me, at least, my slides apparently were lost on the way and have not shown up and in the very short time allowed me for tracing the slides and finding other illustrated material to show you I was unable to find very much. At this season of the year most of the material of this type is out on the road at fairs and other similar places. However, I will try to make up for the lack of actual material by explaining as we go along. You are particularly interested, I assume, in the question of the relation of this insect to industry which you people are representing, and I will try to confine my general remarks to that particular phase of the proposition.<query> what is the purpose of the slides</query> Before going much further I just want to pass around two mounts, one on each side, which show the insect itself in the various stages and two small samples of leaves showing the general way in which it attacks the foliage. Now a little about this insect and how it got here, and so forth. As you surmise from the name of the insect ""Japanese Beetle"", it is a native of the islands of Japan and of a certain few nearby islands in that part of the world. So far as we know the insect arrived in this country prior to 1916, and probably somewhere around 1910 to 1912, as a grub or soft grub about the roots of Japanese plants probably the Iris or Azalea or a similar variety, the roots of which come in the soil. It was first found in New Jersey in the vicinity of Riverton which is about nine miles above Camden, on the Jersey shore of the Delaware River in the summer of 1916.<query> where did the japanese beetle come from</query> At the time two inspectors of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture found it, not knowing what it was, but merely recognizing that it was something new to them and not a habitat found in this part of the country as far as they knew, and after a. little searching around there, being enthusiastic collectors as well as official inspectors, they tried to find as many individuals as they could to work with it. They found in the neighborhood of a dozen or so within a quarter mile radius of this same field. It happened to be along the edge of a little creek running through there where they found them. Four years after that, in 1920, one man collected in about two hours' time six quarts of the beetles. Now there are relatively 3500 beetles in a pint or 7000 in a quart so you can judge from that something of the increase in numbers of the insect since that time.<query> where are beetles found</query> The insect has spread annually, as we believe, at a definite rate from the original point of infestation, at the rate of five to ten miles per year in all directions. That we believe to be the normal actual spread of the insect in new environment. The map I have here which I will open up (does so); shows color variations which indicate the gradual spread of the insect from the original point of infestation. You will notice the different colors represent the spread year by year from the original point of infestation, which point is in the centre of the map here, and a scale of the map is an inch to a mile. You can get a good idea from that as to the rate of spread. This is the City of Philadelphia here (indicating) the Delaware River running up to Trenton, up here towards New York; this being Riverton right up here, and the original point of infestation about three miles out from the town.<query> how fast do insects spread</query> That represents, as well as we have any example, the comparatively steady spread of an insect in a new locality, steady and uniform, and we do not expect to be able to prevent that yearly spread, the actual spread of the insect. At the present time the infested area, or rather up to the beginning of the present season. the middle of June, the infested area covered 770 square miles, the increase being from less than one-half a square mile in 1916. So far as is known the insect does not occur any place in the world other than this infested area in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and its original home country in and near the islands of Japan; and one phase of our work, namely, quarantine enforcement is aimed to prevent as far as possible the widespread distribution of this insect.<query> where do mosquitoes live</query> Now a little as to the life history; you are more or less acquainted with a class of insects closely related to this Japanese Beetle, that is, the May beetles or June beetles, as they are commonly called. This Japanese insect belongs to the same general family of Mayor June beetles. If we start at the present season for instance to trace the life history throughout the year just now we are in the tail end of the beetle season. At the present time the progeny of the present beetle generation, the eggs and grub which have hatched from that, is in the ground feeding. They will remain here all winter and until next spring as a grub, increasing in size, at least increasing up to real cold weather and then hibernating for the winter and recommencing growth in the spring up until we will say about the middle of May.<query> what is the life cycle of a june beetle</query> Then there is a transformation, still under the ground, to what we know as the pupa stage. For instance, you are acquainted with the June beetle caterpillar, the beetle in the intermediate stage that is the cocoon, it is the intermediate stage. This stage lasts apparently about two weeks. The earliest beetles commence hatching between the 10th and 15th of June. Throughout the rest of the summer then there is a continuous hatching of the beetles. But the height of the season is from the latter part of June through July and early August that completes the life history for the year. There is but one generation per year so far as we know. A single female beetle will lay on an average of 30 to 60 eggs during her laying period which extends practically through the season of the beetle flight from the latter part of June until early August.<query> when do beetles hatch</query> Now, to give you an idea of the ability of this species to carry itself through and to show how it withstands adverse conditions. It does not breed as rapidly as some other insects but it has practically 100 percent of young that come through to maturity. To illustrate that point I will cite this one example. Two or three years back we were interested in finding out how many eggs would hatch and mature, so for a number of days we collected 100 eggs a day for a period of three weeks, taking them from different places in the soil and we averaged 99 or slightly better than that in the average of each 100 eggs hatched and the grub surviving. In another test we collected 1200 eggs in one day from a number of points, brought them into the laboratory, each egg was put in a small tin an inch in diameter, in soil and kept to determine the hatching, and we were able to hatch out exactly 1200 larvae from the 1200 eggs.<query> how many eggs hatch in a day</query> In other words, the insect in all stages is very resistant to adverse conditions, which explains why we have such an increase in the comparatively few years it has been here. Now a little bit about the habits of the insect: The more injurious stage is the parent beetles. We have records of their feeding on something over 200 different species of plants. I think it is about 220 including useful and cultivated varieties as well as non-useful weed varieties. There are certain different preferences they make. They show a preference for certain weeds such as smart weed, alder and mallow. Unfortunately, however, their preference is not strong enough to allow them or to keep them feeding on the weed varieties only and there seems to be a notable tendency, as the insect becomes better established, to leave the weed varieties for the cultivated varieties.<query> what is the most injurious stage of a beetle</query> There is only one cultivated class, ornamental, that is distinctly free of attack from the insect and that is the conifer group, arbor vitae, pines, hemlocks, all that class. We have no record of their feeding on that class of plants. Now, from your standpoint it is quite possible that the grub, or young form, will be equally, if not more seriously destructive because of the fact that they feed on the roots of plants, particularly grass. Now, they are comparatively a small grub and a few grubs in the sod we will say don't make any appreciable difference. I mean by that 100 to 150 per square yard. It sounds quite a few but from our angle it is not. Now they begin to be real serious when they run up to three to five hundred grubs to the square yard.<query> what kind of plants do grubs eat</query> Under these conditions you can and will get serious injury to the sod, particularly in the fall, and especially if that is followed by a hard winter there will be a good deal of dying out of the sod. Now, when they get what we call real dense, that is, over 500 to the square yard, then you are pretty sure to get serious injury. To give you an idea of how high they may go, a year ago this fall the highest infestation we found was 1035 grub in a measured square yard in the golf course at Riverton. That is a good many grubs. That figure is not simply based on one examination but an average of several in the most heavily infested places. We thought that was about the limit that could be reached but an examination already this fall, just beginning there, seems to promise a figure running up close to 1500.<query> how many grubs in a square yard</query> You can realize that that degree of infestation may be called a heavy infestation and undoubtedly will give lots of trouble. Now, a little about the work we are doing at Riverton because we all have run into at least the quarantine phase of it at one time or another; if you have not, you will, especially in the purchase of nursery stock from this part of the country. The work is divided into certain main phases: For instance, part has to do with the study of the life history, the habits of the insect in, the new environment, the changes from year to year as it becomes better acclimated, and so forth. Another line has to do with the importation and distribution of parasites which we hope will eventually hold the insect in reasonable check. In Japan the insect is not of any economical importance itself.<query> what is the quarantine phase of a bug</query> They have occasional outbreaks where it does some damage and they collect a lot by hand and destroy them; but I suppose in 100 years there has not been the amount of injury occasioned in Japan that there has been in the last two years in the heavily infested areas of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There are two reasons for the apparent non-importance of the insect in Japan. One is the cultural practices of the country. There is practically no waste land; everything is intensively cultivated, so that the opportunities for the insect to breed in large numbers are very limited. The breeding places chosen are grass fields, pastures and waste lands in general, and, of course, around this part of the country there are plenty of them. The other reason for the lack of serious injury in Japan is the presence of native natural enemies of the insect; in other words, there are insects which prey upon it, which we commonly call parasites.<query> why are there no insect in japan</query> These parasites we know to be present there in reasonable abundance. We have now three or four men in that part of the world who are studying the situation and sending us parasites as fast as they have material available. The parasite material is shipped to us and it is taken care of at the laboratory. Some times it comes at the time of year and at the stage where the parasites can be released immediately in the infested area. Other shipments come in such a way that the material must be carried over during the winter or at least during a season before the conditions are right for the material to be released. The ultimate object of holding this insect down to a point where it can no longer be a serious pest lies in the shipment of a sufficient sequence of parasite enemies to keep the number of the host down to a reasonable small limit.<query> when do parasites come in</query> Eventually possibly certain of the native parasites existing here, the normal beetle related species to the Japanese beetle will also attack the Japanese beetle. But the main reliance must be placed upon the known natural enemies which must be brought over. Now, it will take quite a few years before the parasites can be brought to the point where they are practically proficient in keeping this pest under reasonable control. As to removing from the class of dangerous insects, we do not stress that point very much; it may be ten to fifty years; and nobody is in position to give an estimate. Meanwhile the insect is increasing and spreading and is causing damage and is going to do more. Therefore, other important phases of our work have to do with the development of methods to control the pest, not only from the standpoint of the destruction of the parent beetle itself but also for the destruction of the grubs in the soil.<query> how long does it take to get rid of japanese beetle</query> The insect or beetle is quite resistant to the ordinary poisons such as arsenate of lead, Paris green, etc., that are commonly employed, or at least they are wise enough to know enough to let them alone. It is an open question as yet even whether beetles simply won't feed very much on arsenate of lead, for instance, or whether they will eat just enough arid know when it is well to stop. The fact remains that arsenate of lead, as a common insecticide, we have not yet been able to say will kill a large number of the beetles. It does give a certain amount of relief, but not many eases are very satisfactory in the prevention of injury to the foliage by simply driving the beetles from the sprayed trees to places where the spray is not present. That is a sort of backhanded way of getting at it and of course, if carried on continuously will, eventually devolve on the proposition of driving them from one place to another.<query> what kills beetles</query> We are working on that angle seeking to find a material which will kill a bulk of the insects which feed upon it, which is, safe to use on the foliage without resulting injury to the foliage and with which the cost of using is not excessive. From the standpoint of grub destruction we are also carrying on considerable work. It is possible to destroy the grub by using the sodium cyanide solution and spraying it or applying it to the infested soil. It will kill 90 to 95 percent of the grubs in the soil in the early fall while they are close to the surface. The drawback is the cost. The material runs from $60 to $75 per acre, not counting the cost of labor and the fact that special equipment is necessary to apply it. I believe that most of us will agree that the cost is excessive and certainly it is from the standpoint of the average farm land.<query> cost to destroy grubs</query> We are concerned, therefore, in finding a cheaper method of treatment and we believe we have found a satisfactory material in a carbon disulphide emulsion which will be satisfactory at least the two years of experimental work dealing with this material have given very satisfactory results. Another phase of the work is the quarantine. As I mentioned in the first place, we do not expect to be able to prevent the normal yearly spread of the insect, averaging between five and ten miles a year; in fact, if we had nothing but that to consider we would not have much to consider because it would take many years to go a long distance. But when we consider the fact that the insects can be spread in one year or even less, the actual spread will occur in one week through the shipment of infected nursery stock from one side of the country to the other and you realize why it is we lay so much stress upon the quarantine, a quarantine that simply restricts and controls the movement of nursery stock to places outside, does not absolutely prohibit but allows the movement only under conditions which will not spread the insect; in other words, shipments of the type which will not carry the insect are allowed, other shipments are not.<query> how long does it take for a bug to spread</query> Now, as the time is going on, it is getting a little late, I do not want to take up any more time unless you have specific questions. I will call your attention, if interested, to the circular which has been issued or printed describing the insect, its habits, etc., of which I do not have a supply with me, but if you are interested you can get copies by simply writing us for them. This is a small circular describing the insect, its habits, and giving a colored enlargement of the beetle itself, and can be secured by addressing the Japanese Beetle Laboratory at Riverton, New Jersey, or the Department of Agriculture here at Harrisburg. Now we have gone over this rather briefly and hastily. If any of you have questions I will be very glad to answer them, if possible.<query> where is the japanese beetle laboratory</query> From the publication: AACS - Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention Harrisburg, PA August 20, 21, 22 and 23, 1923 Code: A1085 1920-1939 horticulture japanese beetle pest trees Add new comment Why The Cemetery Should be A Garden Date Published: September, 1920 Original Author: W.E. Groves Hamilton, Ontario Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 34th Annual Convention At first sight it may seem presumptuous to talk to an audience of this character on the subject set for me, ""Why the Cemetery Should Be a Garden”. The life business of so many of you is more or less a practical demonstration of the widely accepted principle indicated and looking at the matter from the viewpoint of a plain gardener, the best I can hope to do is to emphasize some of the apparent reasons and with special good fortune; stimulating afresh some thought along these lines.<query> when was the cemetery published</query> What is a garden? The word has probably outgrown in this country its original etymological meaning, “an enclosed space"" and might now be better described as a cultivated space especially cared for. When we recall all the thought, care and attention on devoted today to the gardens of this and other countries it is not difficult to accept this meaning. Adding to this the idea of rest, beauty, memory, faith and hope, it is not far to the great idea that is a place at once so near the human and the divine, that to very many it becomes the most hallowed spot on earth. This is not by any means a fancy picture, and I feel quite safe in the statement: ""Rest, comrades, rest and sleep The thoughts of men shall be As sentinels to keep Your rest from danger free.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> ""Your silent tents of green We deck with fragrant flowers Yours has the suffering been The memory shall be ours."" Linking up the garden idea with the cemetery, may I suggest first, that there is at least some traditional warrant for the assumption that the ""sleeping place"" should have the garden characteristic? Definite statement and perfectly permissible inference shows that again and again in the dim past the thought of garden ""enclosure"" was associated with burial. The cave in a field bought and set aside for a patriarchal burying place being used for more than one generation, at least suggests care. Again “there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulcher, there they laid him” are words covering another familiar instance of the garden tomb. Church history still further confirms the fact that for centuries the garden idea and garden care has been associated with the grounds used as last resting places.<query> what is the garden in a cemetery</query> If in these early years the results were crude, they were probably not more crude than much of the other life of the age. Horticulture in its fine development deserves to rank among any of the arts of sciences, with the result that in present day conditions we can easily find another strong reason for the statement that the cemetery should be a garden. Never in the history of the world has there been such an appreciation of and love for the beautiful in nature as there is today. Statistics on such a subject as this seem out of place, but the assertion can be easily proved by those who delight in the analytical. In this land, as well as in many others, the value of the artistic as a psychological asset is becoming a real factor in commercial life. Home life, town and city life, as well as business life demand this as a positive essential to the progress of civilization.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> Given these conditions it is not far to carry the idea to the last sleeping place, thereby claiming that to keep pace with the times the cemetery should constantly prove the presence of a real horticultural guardian. It should be artistic without being exotic, full of landscape beauty, without being a horticultural exhibition. It might well be a place where spreading lawns, shade-giving trees, blooming shrubs and the song of birds combine to make it a hallowed place for the dead, and a lovely spot for the living. Irrespective of the size of the community served a modern cemetery is almost of necessity rural. Is there not here another strong reason for the hand of the gardener where the influence on the immediate neighborhood is bound to be felt? Just as one good garden on a street is sometimes the inspiration to change the whole character of the street, the impression gathered from a real garden burial ground must be helpful in the district where it is placed.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> As an asset to the town or city there is some value due to the fact that being so often at one of its entrances the visitor gets right here his first and often most lasting impression. This point is worth mentioning, but I do not labor it; passing on to say a word or two on the more definite aspects of the subject. The cemetery should be a garden because it is a place of rest. Any student of horticulture will confirm the statement that the idea of restfulness is directly associated with gardens. The best garden planners constantly have this in mind. The glaring and the gaudy both in color and form are omitted from worth while designing, and in their place there is a striving after the harmony which means variety in unity, that peacefulness of effect, which is but another name for restfulness.<query> why is a cemetery a garden</query> Landscaping has yet to be treated in this convention and I do not intrude, but I may be allowed the statement that the tendency of the best landscape gardeners is to avoid shocks and to emphasize quietness, to put an embargo on the merely artificial, that the natural may be accentuated. A true garden brings rest to practically all the senses in the very highest degree, and because of this fact I am unhesitating in the statement that man's last earthly sleeping place in its. environment may well be the most restful of all. Sentiment if you like but one of life's sentiments that we can ill afford to miss. The association of beauty with the garden is yet another reason for the hand of the gardener in the cemetery. Beautification, merely amounting to beautification of home surroundings, is now so general that the idea has almost become an accepted principle.<query> what is the meaning of the word garden</query> Next to the growing for food, the first thought about a garden is beauty. We have looked at this from a general point of view but is especially true of the individual. Both the garden and the grave have about them much of the personal touch and even granting that the sense of beauty does not invariably appear in the garden the call to beauty is nearly always felt in connection with the cemetery lot. Beauty of design, beauty of construction and beauty down to the smallest detail is increasingly demanded, and in these days when by common consent we pay every respect to our honored dead, beauty of surroundings surely has a place. The idea of memory in this connection is so obvious that it needs hardly more than mere mention. The tree planters of one generation call for thankful remembrance by the next from an economic point of view.<query> what is the meaning of beauty in the garden</query> The garden that counts its timely decades rather than years naturally has clustered around it the most sacred memories. Whilst the almost imperishable record in granite and marble is strikingly imposing, the memory of past generations will assuredly be sweeter if it is in part associated with trees. And if in the march of time the cemeteries of the cities reach the point where they are past serving their original purpose and to some extent become city breathing places for crowded districts, the practiced hand of the gardener will be revealed where tree and shrub, grass and flower, are blending in nature's finest harmony, the place in very truth becoming a memorial to those who have passed into the unknown. Is it too much to claim for both the garden and the cemetery that they are the homes of faith and hope? A fine text for a sermon, but I refrain from preaching.<query> what is the purpose of a cemetery</query> I am talking to men who can appreciate the idea, being so closely associated with both the aspects suggested, and I venture to submit that there is no profession on earth calling for more constant exercise of these two virtues than that of the man who plants. His hope in the eternal round of the seasons, his trust in the seed he sows, his confidence in the coming of seed-time and harvest bring him constantly close up to the miracles of growth. There is no labor in the universe bringing such reward, no work providing such thrills of joy, no occupation giving such a sense of completeness, content and blessing. And if this be so, I am bold to ask: Do I claim too much in the statement that the garden conception should be closely associated with the burial ground? If there is any real connection between nature and nature's God, surely it can be found where every bud and bloom, every leaf and twig, every branch and every tree, bears silent witness to the faith and hope of man in immortality.<query> what is the connection between the garden and the burial ground</query> And if at times the great phrase ""I am the resurrection and the Life"" fall on the ears of those too stricken to hear, the humble flower at our feet stands out in glorious confirmation. The ""sure and certain hope"" finds its eternal witness in the very blades of grass on which we stand. So I venture to submit to you this morning these simple reasons among many others for the assumption that the cemetery should be a garden. It is at once a pleasure and an honor to speak along these lines to a body of men who by intuition and training are so alive to these great facts, men whose life business it is to make easy some of the darkest hours of their fellows, men who spend their time trying to make the cemetery a fitting place for the living, as well as for the dead, men who have the touch of fine taste and are full of the finer feelings, and I am sure my appeal does not fall on deaf ears.<query> why is the cemetery a garden</query> The flowers of France hallowed because they grow in soil fertilized by the blood of our noblest and best-were silent witnesses to deeds of valor for the great cause of liberty and truth. Are not the same flowers a perpetual reminder as they grow in quietness round our homes and round our tombs, that man lives in deeds, not years, that high ideals and courage dignify and ennoble life, that the way of life leads through the gates of death, and that life alone is worth while which has in it the elements of chivalry, bravery, beauty and truth.

You need to create a hole; it needs to be much wider than the root ball. It's sometimes good to enrich the soil. Whenever you plant a tree, or any plant, you're damaging some of its roots, and you're going to have to give it a little TLC. You want to have a healthy root system that will expand. You want to provide some kind of inducement so that it will expand. Roots are stupid, they're lazy, they'll take the path of least resistance. So if you have a tiny little hole, what are they going to do? They aren't going to try to push through hard dirt. They're just going to travel around and around, and around—until they stop working.<query> how to make a hole for a tree</query> The subject is of such importance as to merit the earnest attention of all.

Seed of all the varieties of grasses I have named can now be had, although in some cases not free from chaff, yet, just as free from weeds as Blue Grass or White Clover. To obtain such, it naturally, follows, that a higher price has to be paid than would be the case if impure seeds were offered: but the difference in the actual cost is so small that this can hardly be considered a factor. I presume that quite a number of you will not agree with me in my conclusions. I hope, however, you will defer judgment until you have had opportunity to compare the result of a two or three kind mixture with a properly balanced lawn grass made up from six or eight varieties.

So if there's a nutrient deficiency, where you'll see it is in the older leaves, because the plant is kind of feeding on itself. If you see new green growth and old yellow growth, it's more than likely due to a nutrient deficiency. There are also a host of minor nutrients. If you're in a place that has high rainfall, molybdenum and sulphur can become deficient—they literally get washed out of the soil. Molybdenum is necessary for plants to be able to use nitrogen. Places in the Southeast often have a molybdinum deficiency. You can replace nitrogen, but if you don't replace the micronutrients, you're not going to get full use of the fertilizer.<query> why do plants grow yellow</query> Ninety five percent or more of the problems you have in your landscape are going to be cultural.

It's bad for the tree; it's tree abuse. Cutting off branches: Unfortunately, in years past, we told people to cut them off against the trunk and we did it so well that now we're having a problem trying to let people know that we told you wrong. So don't cut a limb flush.

We are conducting investigations every year on the treating of plants by the application of germicides and insecticides. I do not know as I can add anything. As I indicated in the beginning, my remarks are entirely informal. I simply want to close by extending a hearty invitation for you to come and see us and if I am not there some of our people will be and will be glad to show you all there is to see.

M. Keller Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 17th Annual Convention That herbaceous plants deserve all the attention which they receive now by the best landscapers, when laying out new grounds or when called upon to alter, improve or partially replant and renovate older establishments, may not be generally admitted, still the fact remains that there are advantages in hardy plants and it is a fact that in late years thousands of these plants are employed, where twenty or thirty years ago only a few dozen were used-it is not a passing fashion for the demand is constantly growing; showing that with each year they gain in popularity and that their merits are more and more appreciated.<query> when was the aacs convention</query> Annual Convention Of all the work pertaining to horticulture there is none so difficult to write about as the planting and pruning of trees and it is almost impossible for one to learn how to do the work by reading for the fact that no two trees are alike. Whoever studies the varied beauties of trees will find that they possess almost a human interest, and their features will reveal varieties of expression, and charms of character, that dull observers cannot imagine. No tree has the highest beauty of its type without the appearance, in its whole bearing, of robust vigor. There may be peculiar charms in the decay of an old trunk, or the eccentric habit of some stunted specimen which ministers to the love of the picturesque; but tree beauty and health are as inseparable in trees as in humanity. Luxuriant vigor is, then, the essential condition of all beautiful trees but thriftiness cannot make an elm look like an oak, but rather brings into higher relief the distinguishing marks of each, making the elm more graceful and the oak more majestic.<query> what is the beauty of trees</query> It is always profitable to give time to intelligent preparation of the soil to receive the trees and to be sure that the roots are kept in a moist condition until established in the new ground, Excavate the soil from a space wide and deep enough to provide for the root growth, throw back the soil so that your trees when planted in the middle of the prepared space will have a deep, mellow bed in which to extend their roots. In planting, the tree should be set in the ground no deeper than it grew in the nursery, which depth may be determined by discoloration of the bark at the base. More trees die from this one cause than from any other. Any broken or injured roots should be pruned so that the ends be smooth. It transplanting trees I would advise liberal doses of old manure or wood ashes.<query> how deep should a tree be planted</query> It is surprising how the roots revel in ground containing such ingredients. Another important factor for quick and luxurious growth is to form basins around the trees in order to catch the water. It is, besides that, a safeguard against the lawn mower. Never allow any grass to grow near your young trees; keep the basins always free of weeds and have the soil stirred up two or three times during the summer and in winter put some short manure on to keep out the cold, and also to serve as a mulch. Be sure to have the basins large enough, never less than one foot in diameter; two feet is much better. You ask--When is the best time to plant trees and my answer is: plant whenever the weather conditions are favorable. There are so many conditions that may work out all right for the grower in a certain locality, but would be the wrong procedure in another locality.<query> when is the best time to plant trees</query> There are some pretty and useful forms of the common box (Buxus) such as naviculatis, Handsworthi and microphylla, which are quite hardy under partial shade. A recently introduced form of the laurel from the Balkan Mountains, said to be very hardy, has been under trial in the Ellwanger & Barry nursery for some years and is reported by them to be very satisfactory. As a broad-leaved evergreen this should be very important. In conclusion, outside the coniferous evergreens the number of flowering and other evergreens suitable for planting in ornamental grounds in this latitude is really not large and not sufficiently extensive, or of that nature so as to produce any marked or broad effect on our landscapes in this climate.

Davey Original Publication: AACS Proceedings of the 41st Annual Convention I came to tell you a little bit about the tree as a living thing.<query> what kind of trees are in the balkan mountains</query> Probably most folks do not realize that the tree is a living, breathing organism. We know it in a sort of an abstract sense, and yet we are not likely to be actively conscious of the fact that it is a living, breathing organism. As a matter of fact the tree is just as much alive as a man. It not only breaths, but it has a circulation, it digests its food, it has sex processes. The tree breathes largely through its leaves and I hope sometime all of you may take occasion to examine the leaf of a tree under a microscope. On the upper side you will see a myriad of cells or little openings into which the air penetrates just as truly as it does into the human lungs. In those cells the air is separated into its parts, the carbon dioxide is extracted from the air and is used as a part of the food material of the tree, or the plant.<query> what is the tree</query> As a matter or fact the tree is just a big plant taken by and large and the oxygen is thrown off for the benefit of man and all animal life. The process is opposite from that in our bodies. There is no bellows in the breathing process in the leaf, but the breathing is just as real and just as vital as in our bodies, and it continues as long as the leaves are green. There is also a complete circulation in the tree. Of course it doesn't move around and around rapidly in response to heart action, and yet it does run the complete course from the little hair roots down in the ground up to the leaves and back again. Just imagine you are looking at a cross section of a tree, that is the same as the top of a stump, and of course in these days when it is a popular pastime to cut trees down, you can find stumps anywhere.<query> why do trees breathe</query> Imagine you are looking at the top of a stump. In the center you see the pit that was there from the time it was a baby, around that is a layer of wood which represents the first year's growth. Around that is a second layer of wood which represents the second year's growth. Around that is a third layer of wood which represents the third year's growth, and so on to the bark. In the beginning when the tree was young and small the central cells were not only structural supports as they are all the time but they were active sap carrying tissue. The cells of a tree overlap each other and they are hollow. In the beginning when they are young there is an opening from one cell to another. So, when the tree was young and smart these central cells were active sap carrying tissue and it was through them that the sap moved upward.<query> when a tree is young and small the central cells are</query> But as the, tree grew in size the central cells became more fined up with mineral elements and therefore more dormant, so, as you go outward toward the bark you find the lust few outside layers of wood, the active sap carrying tissue in those largely. The sap travels upward from the roots to the leaves, imagine, if you will, that you had the power to take from the ground a tree and wash the dirt away from the roots. If you uprooted a tree and washed the dirt away you would see a magnificent structure, a wonderful top balanced by an equally large and magnificent root system. If the top is 50 feet across, the root area is also approximately fifty feet, and at the end of that root system largely are the little hair roots that take up the food in liquid form, send it up through the sap wood of the trunk, out to the leaves, where it undergoes a marvelous change, it is transformed, and then it comes back in the inner cells of the bark, in its digested form, depositing itself all the way down until finally some of it reaches the same little roots from whence it came—so you have a complete circulation that is active as long as the leaves are green.<query> where does sap come from</query> May I suggest that in order to have that circulation you must have leaves, because they are the vital connecting link, and that is why I suppose God Almighty put the leaves on trees. It is one of the reasons, anyway, and it is why there is such a terrible crime in chopping the tops of trees off, that I will refer to later. The digestion which occurs in the leaf is one of the most interesting things that happens in all the realms of life. I shall make bold to say that the leaf, speaking broadly, is the most important thing in the world. Of course I expect you to challenge that because it is a ridiculous thing to say that anyone thing is more important than anything else, and yet if you will bear with me I think I can make my case.<query> why are leaves important</query> In order to illustrate what I have in mind I want to relate a story that I read in the New York Times in 1921. You will remember then that the great famine was sweeping over Russia. They were starving to death literally by the hundreds of thousands. The situation was so bad that some of the big city newspapers sent their special correspondents to Russia to inquire into the situation and report by daily letter. In one of these stories I read this incident: the correspondent told how one day they came upon a house where a little child was sick on a couch, covered with a quilt, and it looked as though there were a pillow under the quilt. Its eyes were still and glassy, staring straight upward, it was all but dead. The correspondent looked at the child and looked at the mother and she divining his purpose pulled back the quilt and disclosed a horrible, misshapen body, its little stomach was horribly distended, very much like a kewpie, its arms and legs were emaciated, it was just about breathing its last.<query> when was the russian famine</query> And then she told what had happened. She said hunger had driven them so far that they had fed this child blue clay, the clay stuck to the teeth and the walls of the stomach and would for the time being stay the pangs of hunger, but there was no power in the human system to throw it off, so it lay there. Finally the worms started to work and the end was near. I tell that story realizing that there is in it a touch of horror because it illustrates and emphasizes a profound truth, there are only two minerals that man can take into his system and assimilate—water and salt, and those only in limited quantities. Everything else we eat and almost everything we wear comes to us through the leaves of vegetation. It is the leaf, speaking of vegetation generally, that takes the dead mineral elements from the soil and transforms them into living cells.<query> what two minerals can man take into his system and assimilate</query> The leaf is the one and only connecting link between the organic world and the inorganic world, meaning the world of living cells on the one hand and the world of dead mineral plants on the other. The leaf is the only thing that has the power to transform dead matter into living matter, and therefore it is the foundation of all life. No life could exist upon this earth if it were not for that vital function performed by leaves, and that is why I say the leaf is the most important thing in the world. The tree has sex processes also that are just as real and just as beautiful as in any other form of life. The male and female exist as positive factors. Sometimes you find the male and female in the same flowers, at other times in different flowers on the same tree, and sometimes the flowers of a tree are all male or all female, the pollen is created in the male parts and is carried partly by the wind and partly by insects to the female organs where conception takes place and the continuity of life is made possible.<query> why is the leaf the most important thing in the world</query>"
