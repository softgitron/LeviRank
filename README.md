# touche-2022
The touche 2022.ipynb is the notebook where I have played around with the code and even tried query expansion

Following up From Ashish's Code I created two more notebooks following the mono duo pipeline

The Intial retrieval.ipynb has to be run first and then the reranker.ipynb

The results obtained are in the csv files 

(Note: I did the initial retrieval after preprocessing the documents. It can be done even without preprocessing)
